description: Analyze product and collection performance using Noibu data. Use when you want to know which products are underperforming, what your best-selling product type is, why a product isn't converting, how your collections are performing, which products get views but no sales, or where shoppers drop off in the product funnel.

# Noibu Product & Collection Performance Analysis

Surfaces which products and collections are winning or losing, and why — built from Noibu session and page data.

## How it works

- **Quick answer** (one focused question) → run 1–2 queries, answer directly, offer to go deeper.
- **Full analysis** (broad request, bare invocation, or "yes" to the offer) → the workflow below.

## Setup — before any query

**Work quietly.** Resolving the domain, loading reference files, reading field names, and running queries all happen silently — no "let me…" commentary. The triage board widget is the first substantive output.

- **Resolve the domain first.** Use what the user gave (name or UUID). If nothing, ask via `AskUserQuestion` populated from their domains — don't ask about anything else. If exactly one domain, skip the question.
- **Use the `querying-noibu-data` reference already loaded in context** — do not read it again. It maps role-based names to real tools/columns and documents query constraints.
- **Call `list_scheduled_tasks`** now — check whether any task's prompt references this domain and store the result. This sets the action bar button label later ("Schedule report" vs "Edit scheduled report") without blocking rendering.
- **Confirm every field name by role** before using it. Steps name fields by role, never hard-coded column names.
- **Default window:** from the context reference; if none, last 30 days.
- **If the entire dataset is near-zero** (total sessions 0 or a handful), say plainly the domain has no traffic in this window and offer to widen the range or pick another domain.

## Quick answer

For focused questions ("which products get the most views?", "how is the Sale collection performing?"):

1. Run only the 1–2 queries needed.
2. Answer directly — a few sentences and a small table if useful.
3. Offer full analysis; if yes, proceed below.

Don't load the triage-board or scheduling references for a quick answer.

## Full analysis

A broad request, a bare invocation, or "yes" to the quick-answer offer.

**Loading reference files:** Use the `Read` tool. All files live in a `references/` subdirectory next to this SKILL.md — derive the base path from wherever this file was loaded from.

1. Read `references/queries.md` AND `references/triage-board.md` now, before running any queries.
2. Run the four-step workflow from queries.md.
3. Render the overview card, priority cards, and action bar as one `show_widget` using triage-board.md. Use the `list_scheduled_tasks` result from setup to set the schedule button label.

After the widget, add a single short closing line so the turn ends with visible text — a `show_widget` with no following text can be read as "no visible output" and trigger a duplicate re-render. Keep it to one sentence naming what it is; don't recap the findings or restate what's in the widget.

## Create live dashboard

Triggered by the overview card 'Save as dashboard' button (arrives as "Save product overview as dashboard for [domain]").

Read `references/live-dashboard.md` and follow the instructions there to build and save the artifact. `references/triage-board.md` is already in context from the full analysis.

---

## Export PDF

Triggered by the action bar button (arrives as "Export product analysis as PDF for [domain]").

Read `references/export-pdf.md` and follow the instructions there.

---

## Schedule report

Triggered by the action bar button (arrives as "Schedule product analysis for [domain]" or "Edit schedule for [domain]").

Read `references/schedule-widget.md` and render it as a `show_widget`. After the widget, add a single short closing line so the turn ends with visible text — don't recap the options, just name what it is.

---

## Investigate click

A triage-board **Investigate** button arrives as a chat prompt ("Investigate this product signal: …") — handle as a focused follow-up, not a re-render of the board.

- **Don't re-run the breakdown that built the card** — reuse the evidence already gathered; only query again if genuinely new depth is needed.
- **Go one level deeper** for root cause. A single Investigate may surface more than one cause.
- **Route the what-next by cause type — decide this *after* diagnosing, never on the button click:**
  - **UX / merchandising / funnel / ops / localization** → write the action inline: one concrete, owner-routed step + the check that confirms resolution.
  - **Priority error or performance/CWV** → invoke the `tech-diagnosis` skill directly (read it via the `Read` tool using its path from the available skills list) and continue inline. Do not output a slash command or handoff text — the user should not see any `/tech-diagnosis ...` syntax.
- **Respond in plain chat text — do not use `show_widget`.** Format: root cause in 1–2 sentences, then a small markdown table of supporting evidence (≤8 rows), then the recommended action or tech-diagnosis output. Keep it tight; don't re-render the board.

## Data quality notes

- **CVR is only comparable within the same price tier.** High-ticket products and collections will always convert at lower rates than low-ticket items — this is expected, not a signal. Never flag low CVR as underperformance without a same-tier benchmark. Use product and collection names to infer price tier; when no same-tier benchmark exists, rely on `ATC_LIFT_OPPORTUNITY` and funnel depth instead. This limitation applies at every level — product, collection, and product type. Price data is not available in Noibu session data.
- **Revenue per product unavailable.** Order value = total cart for the session — all products in that session get credited the full value. Never label it "product revenue." Use purchase session count as the primary volume metric; median cart value as secondary.
- **Product title variants.** Same base product may appear as multiple rows (e.g. "WOMENS CLASSIC TEE - WT0200005" vs "WOMEN'S CLASSIC TEE - WT0200005"). Flag near-duplicates; don't silently merge.
- **URL fragmentation.** Always use URL CONTAINS with a SKU code or slug fragment in page visit queries.
- **Null funnel depth = viewed only.** Always label as "Viewed only", not blank or missing.
