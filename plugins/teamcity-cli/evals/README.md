# TeamCity CLI Skill Evals

A/B evaluation of the `teamcity-cli` agent skill: same model, same tasks, same
live server — the skill is the only variable.

| Treatment | What Claude Code gets                   |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `CONTROL` | the `teamcity` CLI, no skill — baseline  |
| `CURRENT` | the CLI **+** `skills/teamcity-cli/`     |

The headline metric is the **paired skill lift**: per-task
`CURRENT − CONTROL` deterministic pass rate, averaged across tasks, with a
bootstrap 95% CI. Because both arms run in the same session against the same
server, live-data drift cancels out of the difference.

## Quick start

```bash
just eval-setup                  # install dependencies
cp evals/.env.example evals/.env # configure (1Password refs or literals)

just eval --runs=2 -n 8          # full suite, both treatments
just eval --task=investigate-failure --treatment=CURRENT
just eval-unit                   # harness unit tests only (no server, no API)
just eval-diff                   # gate/report the current branch's results
just eval-diff results/A results/B   # informational A/B diff
```

## How a run is scored

1. **Deterministic checks** (gate-relevant). Executed commands are tokenized —
   never substring-matched — and validated against `cli_schema.json`, which is
   regenerated from the binary's cobra command tree on every session
   (`go run scripts/generate-cli-schema.go`). An invented flag is a failure;
   a real flag can never be misflagged, because the allowlist cannot rot.
2. **LLM judge** (advisory). Sonnet grades subjective dimensions with anchored
   rubrics. Judge scores are reported separately and **never** blend into the
   deterministic pass rate. If the judge is unavailable the dimension is
   recorded as *ungraded* — it fails closed, not open.
3. **Metadata**, not scores: whether the skill was available (treatment) vs
   actually invoked (observed), full provenance (git SHA, CLI/claude/skill
   versions, model, task-set hash).

**Pytest pass/fail means harness health only.** A CONTROL run scoring zero
checks is a *measurement* — the baseline being weak is the point, not a test
failure. Only harness breakage (claude crashed, unparseable output) fails
pytest.

## The gate (`scripts/compare.py`)

Self-contained: computed from the session's own artifacts, no cross-build
baseline, identical on `main` and branches.

- **BLOCK** if the paired-lift CI lower bound < `GATE_LIFT_FLOOR` (default
  −5 pts) — the skill stopped helping.
- **BLOCK** if a guardrail task (single-treatment, e.g. `negative-unrelated`)
  fails on ≥ half its reps — the skill misfires on unrelated work.
- `GATE_MODE=warn` (default) reports the verdict but exits 0; flip to
  `enforce` once thresholds have soaked. Needs ≥ `GATE_MIN_TASKS` (3) paired
  tasks, so partial local runs just report.

Also reported: per-task `pass^2` (probability both reps pass — reliability,
not just average), judge means per arm, and `gate_summary.json` for trend
tooling.

## CI pipeline

`TeamCity_TeamCityCLI_SkillEval` on teamcity-nightly; the pipeline YAML
lives server-side (`teamcity pipeline pull` to inspect, edit → `teamcity
pipeline validate` → `teamcity pipeline push` to change). Per run: build
the CLI from the commit under test →
change-gate (skips with an explicit `SKIPPED` build status unless
`skills/teamcity-cli/`, `evals/`, or the schema generator changed) → pinned
`@anthropic-ai/claude-code` install → schema generation → `pytest tests/
--runs=2 -n 8` → gate. Pytest and the gate exit codes both propagate — nothing
is `|| true`'d away.

Known gaps (deliberate, next phases): no nightly schedule (pipelines YAML has
no trigger support — add via UI), live server instead of record/replay
cassettes, judge uncalibrated against human labels.

## Sentry

When `SENTRY_DSN` is set, each run is pushed as a `gen_ai.invoke_agent`
transaction (one `gen_ai.execute_tool` child span per tool call) tagged with
`experiment_id`/`task`/`treatment`/`skill_available`/`skill_invoked` plus full
provenance. Sentry is dashboards and drill-down only — gating always runs on
the local `results/` artifacts, which are the authoritative record.

## Langfuse

When `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`/`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` are set, each run is pushed as a
trace (name = task, `user_id` = treatment, `session_id` = experiment) with the
agent root, a generation child carrying token usage, and one `tool` span per
tool call. Quality signals are first-class **scores** — `pass_rate`, `passed`,
`pass_bucket`, `skill_invoked`, `duration_sec`, `num_turns`, `total_tokens`, and
`judge:<dim>` — so dashboards aggregate them natively without span-timing hacks.
Sentry and Langfuse both emit when configured; each is a no-op when its keys are
unset. Like Sentry, Langfuse is observability only — gating always runs on the
local `results/` artifacts.

## Adding a task

1. Add an entry to `tasks.json`: `id`, `prompt`, `checks` (IDs from
   `CHECK_REGISTRY`), optional `llm_grade`, optional `treatments` (omit for
   both arms; `["CURRENT"]` makes it a guardrail).
2. New check functions go in `checks.py` and the registry. Use
   `runner.has_subcommand(...)`/`runner.has_flag(...)` — don't substring-match
   command lines.
3. Add adversarial coverage in `tests/test_checks.py`: the check must fail on
   known-bad fixtures, not just pass on good ones.
