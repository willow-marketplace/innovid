# List Available Workflows

## Overview

This skill helps you discover all available workflows in an Output SDK project. Workflows are the main execution units that orchestrate steps to accomplish tasks.

## When to Use This Skill

- Discovering what workflows exist in a project
- Verifying a workflow name before running it
- Exploring a new or unfamiliar codebase
- Checking if a specific workflow has been created
- Getting an overview of project capabilities

## Instructions

### List All Workflows

```bash
npx output workflow list
```

This command scans the project and displays all available workflows.

### Understanding the Output

The command outputs a table with workflow information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | The workflow identifier used in commands |
| Description | Brief description of what the workflow does |
| Location | File path where the workflow is defined |

### Finding Workflow Files

Workflows are typically located in:
```
src/workflows/*/
```

Each workflow directory usually contains:
- `workflow.ts` or `index.ts` - The main workflow definition
- Step files - Individual steps used by the workflow
- Schema files - Input/output type definitions

### Inspecting a Workflow

After finding a workflow, you can examine its code:

```bash
# Read the workflow file
cat src/workflows/<workflowName>/workflow.ts

# Or examine the entire workflow directory
ls -la src/workflows/<workflowName>/
```

## Examples

**Scenario**: Discover available workflows in a project

```bash
npx output workflow list

# Example output:
# Name          Description                    Location
# -----------   ---------------------------    --------------------------------
# simple        Simple workflow example        src/workflows/simple/workflow.ts
# data-pipeline Process and transform data     src/workflows/data-pipeline/workflow.ts
# user-signup   Handle user registration       src/workflows/user-signup/workflow.ts
```

**Scenario**: Verify a workflow exists before running

```bash
# Check if "email-sender" workflow exists
npx output workflow list | grep email-sender

# If no output, the workflow doesn't exist
# If found, proceed with running it
npx output workflow run email-sender --input '{"to": "user@example.com"}'
```

**Scenario**: Explore workflow implementation

```bash
# List workflows
npx output workflow list

# Find the location and examine it
cat src/workflows/simple/workflow.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### No workflows found
- Ensure you're in the project root directory
- Check that workflows are in `src/workflows/*/`
- Verify workflow files export a default workflow

### Workflow not showing
- Check the file exports a valid workflow definition
- Ensure the workflow file compiles without errors
- Run `npm run output:worker:build` to check for TypeScript errors
