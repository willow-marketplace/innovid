// the diagnosis and the correct remedy for a plugin file that's missing
// or invalid: reinstall or update the plugin, with per-harness commands
// so the user isn't left guessing. (A placeholder-only problem — e.g. an
// unresolved `${JFROG_PLATFORM_URL}` — is handled separately and
// automatically by jfrog-substitute-mcp-placeholders.mjs, the one place
// in this skill that does edit the file in place; this script is only
// reached when that auto-fix isn't applicable.)
//
// OpenCode has no plugin-owned mcp.json — remedy differs: add the JFrog
// plugin or paste the mcp.jfrog entry manually (see mcp-plugin-config.md).
//
// Usage: node jfrog-reinstall-jfrog-plugin.mjs
// Always exits 0 after printing.
