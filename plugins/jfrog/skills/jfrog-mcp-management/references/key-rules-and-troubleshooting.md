# Key rules & troubleshooting

Reference for the Install and List flows of the `jfrog-mcp-management` skill.

## Key Rules

- **Package scope is case-sensitive — ALWAYS write it lowercase as
  `@jfrog/agent-guard`, NEVER `@JFrog/agent-guard`.** npm scopes are
  case-sensitive; the published package is the lowercase `@jfrog/agent-guard`.
  Capitalizing the brand (`@JFrog`) points at a different/nonexistent scope and
  breaks the command. Use the exact lowercase string in every command and config
  entry.
- **`npx` arg order:** `--yes`, `--registry <REGISTRY_URL>`, `@jfrog/agent-guard`, then
  agent guard flags. Canonical invocation:
  `npx --yes --registry <REGISTRY_URL> @jfrog/agent-guard`. Both `--yes` and
  `--registry` MUST precede the package name or `npx` falls back to the default
  registry (404) and may block on a no-TTY prompt.
- **Always `"type": "stdio"`** pointing at
  `npx --yes --registry <REGISTRY_URL> @jfrog/agent-guard`, even for
  remote-only catalog MCPs (the agent guard proxies them). `"http"`, `"sse"`,
  or a top-level `"url"` bypass the agent guard.
- `_JF_ARGS` is **only** for the config entry the agent launches at session
  start (the `env` of the entry written when adding an MCP); MUST contain
  `project=<JFROG_PROJECT_KEY>&mcp=<PACKAGE_NAME>`. NEVER pass `_JF_ARGS` to
  `--list-available`, `--inspect`, or `--login` — those take `--server` /
  `--project` / `--mcp` as CLI flags only. Conversely, NEVER put `--project`
  or `--mcp` in the config entry's `args` — that is CLI-only; config uses
  `_JF_ARGS`.
- **Three invocation contracts — do not mix:** (1) Step 0 gate
  `jfrog-agent-guard-check.mjs` — optional positional jf `<SERVER_ID>` only,
  no flags; (2) catalog CLI — `--server` / `--project` / `--mcp` flags;
  (3) config stdio entry — `_JF_ARGS=project=…&mcp=…`, optional `--server`
  in `args` only when not on the env URL+token path.
- `<SERVER_ID>` is always a `jf config` server id. NEVER an MCP package
  name, NEVER a URL, and NEVER a hostname you derived from `JFROG_URL` /
  `JF_URL`. Hostname-shaped ids from `jf config show` itself are fine —
  the ban is on parsing an id out of the URL, not on the shape of the
  value.
- NEVER assume `default` as a JFrog project key. If the project key is unknown
  after the project chain (existing `mcpServers` entries → `JF_PROJECT` env
  var), STOP and ask the user. Same for server ID if used. NEVER invent or
  guess JFrog project keys or server IDs.
- Package name MUST come from the catalog (`--inspect` / `--list-available`).
  NEVER guess. NEVER install MCPs outside the agent guard. NEVER use
  Fetch/WebFetch for catalog calls.
- **Non-zero Agent Guard exit → classify, never invent a fallback install.**
  Retryable fingerprints retry; catalog miss → List; **any other stderr is a
  hard stop** (show it, do not retry, do not fall back to the usual MCP install
  routes that skip the approved catalog and Agent Guard as the MCP proxy). See
  [Classify npx @jfrog/agent-guard failures](#classify-npx-jfrogagent-guard-failures).
- NEVER pipe a catalog command through `python3`, and NEVER capture it with
  `2>&1` — `npx`/`npm` writes progress to stderr, which corrupts the output
  stream. For `--list-available` present the compact TSV it prints; for
  `--inspect` read the JSON it prints on stdout directly (or with a single `jq`
  filter), never via `python3`.
- NEVER write a raw secret into any MCP config file (see
  [harness-common.md](harness-common.md) for each harness's file) — always use
  `${VAR_NAME}`. NEVER show tokens / API keys.
- NEVER try multiple servers — ask the user to pick one.

## Classify npx @jfrog/agent-guard failures

Show the error verbatim. Ignore `npm warn` noise — except `npm warn invalid
config registry=…`, which names the cause of a self-inflicted E404. Match
**one** bucket from stderr. Fingerprints below are the live strings; if a
match fails, re-check
`npx --yes --registry <REGISTRY_URL> @jfrog/agent-guard --version` rather
than assuming a pinned release. A **hard stop** means: do not fall back to
the usual MCP install routes that skip the approved catalog and Agent Guard
as the MCP proxy.

1. **Package unreachable (hard stop).** `npm error code E404`, `npm error 404`,
   npx package-fetch **403**, DNS/`ENOTFOUND`, timeout/`ETIMEDOUT`, connection
   refused/`ECONNREFUSED`. Agent Guard never started. Two self-inflicted causes
   look identical to a real outage, so rule both out first: (a) `--yes` and
   `--registry <REGISTRY_URL>` must precede `@jfrog/agent-guard`, and (b)
   `<REGISTRY_URL>` must be substituted with a real URL — npm discards an
   invalid `--registry` value, falls back to the default registry, and returns
   the same E404, so compare it against the URL npm reports contacting. Fix and
   retry if either is wrong. Otherwise tell the user the registry could not be
   reached, point them at [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) (proxy/VPN,
   blocked or wrong registry, curation policy), and **stop**.
2. **Catalog miss (retry via List).** `not found in curated list` — the catalog
   responded; that MCP name is not approved. Go to List → Available to install.
   Same fingerprint on `--login`. A wrong `--project` key can surface as this
   miss on the MCP name — re-resolve the project key if List is empty.
3. **Retryable CLI/config.** `--project flag is required`, `--mcp flag is required`,
   `Server ID '…' does not exist.`, `multiple/no JFrog server configured`. Fix
   per Troubleshooting / Pre-flight and retry the **same** Agent Guard command.
4. **Any other non-zero (hard stop).** Unrecognized stderr (including
   `Unauthorized`, `failed to fetch catalog`, `_JF_ARGS environment variable is not set`,
   5xx). Show it verbatim. Do not retry List. Do not guess another bucket.
   Carve-out: `--login` `expected 401, got 200` is anonymous MCP — ignore, not
   this bucket.

## Troubleshooting

Items below are harness-agnostic unless they point into the current harness's
row in [harness-common.md](harness-common.md).

- **"connected" but 0 tools** (empty tool/capability list in the harness's
  verify view — e.g. Claude Code's `/mcp` `Capabilities:`) — agent guard proxy
  started, upstream MCP did not. A "connected" label is misleading here. NEVER
  report success when there are 0 tools.
  1. Relaunch in the harness's debug mode if it has one (e.g. Claude Code:
     `claude --debug`) and read the agent guard stderr; diagnose by MCP type:
     - **OAuth (remote)** — re-run the OAuth login (`--login`); refresh token
       likely expired.
     - **Static-token (remote)** — confirm every `${VAR}` in `env` is exported
       in the launching shell and the token is still valid.
     - **Local (stdio)** — check that the bundled binary actually launched
       (agent guard stderr will show the spawn error).
  2. Verify that the MCP server is still allowed. See the skill's "Available to
     install" flow.
- **Configured server missing from the harness's list/verify view** —
  rejected/pending. Re-run the enable/verify step (Install → Step 4a).
- **MCP still appears as approved (or won't go away) after editing the config**
  — on harnesses that pre-approve via files (e.g. Claude Code), approval state
  lives in plain JSON arrays read at session start (nothing cached, so `npm
  cache clean` is unrelated). Check that harness's approval-precedence list in
  [harness-common.md](harness-common.md) and remove the entry from every file
  that lists it, then restart. On UI-toggle harnesses (Cursor, VS Code) there is
  no such file — disable/stop the server in the harness's MCP view instead.
- **Agent Guard: `multiple/no JFrog server configured`** (the agent guard
  cannot pick a JFrog server) — pass `--server <ID>` (after `jf c add <ID>`) OR
  export both `JFROG_URL` and `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the launching shell, then
  restart the agent.
- **`Server ID '<id>' does not exist.`** — `--server` is not a configured jf
  CLI server. Re-resolve the id (Pre-flight) or `jf c add`, then retry. Not a
  catalog miss and not package-unreachable.
- **`--project flag is required` / `--mcp flag is required`** — empty or
  omitted flag; fill from Pre-flight / the MCP name and retry.
- **OAuth MCP failing** — refresh token expired; re-run the OAuth login step.
- **401/403 with `${VAR}`** — env var unset/wrong; re-export in the launching
  shell and restart the agent.
- **Network / proxy / DNS error** — outside the agent guard's scope; tell the
  user and stop. This is package-unreachable per
  [Classify npx @jfrog/agent-guard failures](#classify-npx-jfrogagent-guard-failures)
  — never install the MCP by any other means as a workaround. Before stopping,
  though: in a Cursor sandbox agent a `403` on a JFrog host is the sandbox
  allowlist and has a concrete fix — see the "403 … in a Cursor sandbox agent"
  entry below.
- **npx package fetch returns 403 or 404** — usually a corporate proxy/VPN, a
  blocked or wrong registry, the JFrog registry being unreachable, or a
  curation policy — not a missing package. The default
  `<REGISTRY_URL>` (`https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/coding-agents-npm/`)
  is JFrog's publicly accessible Releases Artifactory instance: anonymous
  access, hosts Agent Guard releases. Confirm `--registry <REGISTRY_URL>`
  resolves (and, if using a private override via `JFROG_AGENT_GUARD_REPO`, that
  the access token is valid for that repo). Same hard-stop rule applies: do
  not fall back to the usual MCP install routes that skip the approved catalog
  and Agent Guard as the MCP proxy.
- **403 (or a Step 0 network failure) in a Cursor sandbox agent (Agents
  Window)** — Cursor's network allowlist. Retry once with
  `required_permissions: ["full_network"]`; if it still 403s, has no effect, or
  the param isn't on the Shell tool, create `~/.cursor/sandbox.json` (or the
  project `.cursor/sandbox.json`) per the "Sandbox network allowlist" section in
  [harness-cursor.md](harness-cursor.md). Do NOT keep retrying `full_network`
  or punt to a manual/out-of-sandbox run.
