# JFrog Reference Architecture

Planning skill for topology, sizing, and deployment. Answers must come from
**live fetches** of the [JFrog Platform Reference Architecture](https://jfrog.com/reference-architecture/) — not from training data or duplicated tables in this repo.

## Prerequisites

- Read `../jfrog/SKILL.md` for JFrog Platform concepts, product vocabulary, and routing to other workflows.
- **No `jf` CLI required** for planning-only questions (no live instance needed).

## Source of truth

| Allowed in this skill | Not allowed |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Fetch procedures, workflows, output templates | Sizing RPM tables, use-case narratives, deployment checklists copied from the site |
| Helm chart **preference** (jfrog-platform on Kubernetes) | Hardcoded slug lists or criteria |

**Every factual claim** (numbers, template names, limitations, infrastructure guidance) must come from a **`WebFetch` in the current session**. If fetch fails, retry or ask the user to open the URL — do not guess from memory.

**Citations:** Use the `URL:` line from the relevant section in the fetched content (public HTML URL). You may note content was read from `llms-full.txt`.

For fetch URLs, size thresholds, and the fallback ladder, see [references/doc-access.md](references/doc-access.md).

## Gotchas

| Symptom | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Sizing numbers or use-case names not on the official site | `WebFetch` ref-arch first; cite `URL:` from the fetch — not training data |
| `small` template recommended for production | Re-read production warnings in the fetched Artifactory/Xray sizing sections |
| SaaS section missing or 404 | SaaS paths use prefix **`jfrog-saas`**, not `saas` |
| HA storage guidance wrong | Per ref arch: **`cluster-file-system`** or object storage — not `file-system` for HA |
| `WebFetch` blocked, truncated, or over size limits | Request `full_network`; downgrade per [references/doc-access.md](references/doc-access.md) |

## Session bootstrap

Before answering a reference-architecture question:

1. **`WebFetch`** `https://jfrog.com/reference-architecture/llms-full.txt` (primary).
2. Keep the response in context for follow-ups in the same thread.
3. Note approximate response size. If over **1 MB**, or truncated, follow the downgrade path in `references/doc-access.md` (sitemap + targeted `index.md`).
4. Re-bootstrap when uncertain after long unrelated conversation.

Request **`full_network`** (or the runtime equivalent) when `WebFetch` is blocked.

### Parsing llms-full.txt

Sections are separated by `---` and typically include:

- `# <Title>`
- `URL: https://jfrog.com/reference-architecture/...`
- Optional `> <summary>`
- Body text (may be condensed vs the HTML page)

Use only text from the fetch. For recommendations, cite the section’s `URL:` line.

## Intent routing

| User intent | Where to look in llms-full | Fallback |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Sizing | `# Sizing`, `# AWS Sizing`, Azure, GCP sections | `.../self-managed/deployment/sizing/index.md` |
| Topology / use case | Matching title + `URL:` for SaaS (`jfrog-saas`) or self-managed | That path’s `index.md` |
| List use cases | All `URL:` lines containing `/use-cases/` | `sitemap.xml` |
| Deployment / install | Deployment and considerations sections | `.../deployment/index.md` |
| Disaster recovery | DR playbook / tiers sections | Matching `index.md` |

SaaS paths use prefix **`jfrog-saas`**, not `saas`.

## Workflow: Sizing

1. Bootstrap `llms-full.txt` (unless downgraded to single-page fetch).
2. Find the **Sizing** section. Build follow-up questions from **Artifactory Sizing Templates Criteria** in the fetch (peak **Requests Per Minute** and **Concurrent Connections** per template).
3. Use **`AskQuestion`** when available; otherwise numbered options using labels from the fetched table only.
4. If the user mentions Xray or production, use **Xray Sizing Templates Criteria** and production warnings from the same fetch (e.g. small is not for production).
5. If the user names a cloud, use **AWS Sizing** / **Azure** / **GCP** sections from the fetch.
6. Recommend a template (`small` through `2xlarge`) and cite the sizing page `URL:` from the dump.
7. **Helm:** Recommend the [jfrog-platform](https://github.com/jfrog/charts/tree/master/stable/jfrog-platform) chart with `-f sizing/platform-<template>.yaml`. `WebFetch` the chart README if the user wants exact install commands.

### Sizing output template

```markdown
## Recommended sizing

- **Template**: <from fetched table>
- **Artifactory**: <RPM and concurrent connections from fetched table>
- **Xray** (if applicable): <from fetched Xray table>
- **Source**: <URL: line from Sizing section>
- **Helm**: `helm upgrade --install` with `-f sizing/platform-<template>.yaml` on chart `jfrog/jfrog-platform`
- **Caveats**: <Notes / additional factors from fetched Sizing section>
```

## Workflow: Topology and use cases

1. Bootstrap `llms-full.txt`.
2. Ask **1–2 follow-ups per turn** until hosting model and site count are clear:
   - SaaS vs self-managed (if unsure, fetch home/overview from dump and mention SaaS value proposition from site text).
   - Single site vs multi site.
   - For multi-site: DR/failover, geo performance, CI/CD separation, edges, hybrid variants, IoT, subsidiaries/vendors, air-gapped (self-managed only), archiving.
3. **List documented use cases:** Filter all `URL:` lines containing `/use-cases/` from the dump; group under **JFrog SaaS** vs **Self-managed**. Fallback: `sitemap.xml` if the user wants sitemap-complete listing.
4. **Recommend a use case:** Match the user’s answers to sections in the dump; cite each `URL:`. If the dump is insufficient for one page, `WebFetch` `https://jfrog.com/reference-architecture/<path>/index.md` for that `URL:` path.
5. **No exact match:** Suggest combining documented patterns (e.g. active-passive for DR + main-site-with-edges); fetch each component section before describing how they combine. Remind that the ref arch is a starting point for emerging cases.

## Workflow: Deployment

1. Bootstrap `llms-full.txt`.
2. Use deployment, considerations, HA, database, storage, and cloud sections from the fetch.
3. **Default policy (not a substitute for ref-arch facts):** Deploy on **Kubernetes** with the **jfrog-platform** Helm chart even when the user only wants Artifactory — enable Artifactory, disable other products in values. Do not steer to legacy standalone Artifactory charts unless the user explicitly requires non-Kubernetes deployment.
4. Production reminders from fetched content where applicable: external managed PostgreSQL (not bundled chart DB for production), object storage / `cluster-file-system` for HA, Enterprise license for `replicaCount > 1`.
5. `WebFetch` the [chart README](https://github.com/jfrog/charts/tree/master/stable/jfrog-platform) when the user needs install snippets, OpenShift (`openshift-values.yaml` last), or RabbitMQ quorum files.

### Deployment output template

```markdown
## Deployment recommendation

- **Runtime**: Kubernetes + jfrog-platform Helm chart
- **Reference**: <URL: from deployment-related sections>
- **Key considerations**: <bullets from fetched considerations sections>
- **Helm** (if requested): <commands from chart README fetch>
```

## When to read reference files

- **Fetch ladder, Markdown URL rule, size governance:** [references/doc-access.md](references/doc-access.md)

## Examples

**Sizing:** User asks what sizing to set for Artifactory → bootstrap llms-full → ask peak RPM using fetched table options → recommend template and Helm sizing file.

**List use cases:** User asks for all documented use cases → bootstrap llms-full → list grouped by SaaS vs self-managed from `URL:` lines in dump.

**Topology:** User needs DR across two regions → clarify SaaS vs self-managed → recommend active-passive (or related) section from dump with `URL:` citations.

**Deploy:** User wants Artifactory on EKS → deployment + AWS sizing sections from dump → jfrog-platform chart with external DB and sizing values file.
