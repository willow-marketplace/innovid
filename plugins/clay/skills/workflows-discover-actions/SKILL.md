# Discovering Clay actions

This skill helps you find available Clay actions for use in Clay workflow nodes,
via the `clay` CLI. If `clay` isn't on PATH, run the `setup` skill.

Not to be confused with `clay routines` — that lists saved function/workflow
routines in the workspace, a different concept from workflow actions. For
workflow building blocks, use `clay workflows actions`.

## Actions catalog

The catalog is fetched live from the workspace's action catalog API. It includes all available actions with workspace-specific configuration (configured tools, app accounts, credit costs).

Each catalog entry has:

- `actionKey` — unique identifier for the action
- `packageId` — the package this action belongs to
- `displayName` / `name` — human-readable names
- `description` — what the action does
- `outputParameters` — what data the action returns
- `creditCost` — catalog base data-credit price for the workspace's billing plan,
  not a quote for the selected inputs and credentials. `usesPrivateKeyCost` is a
  separate private-key base price. Missing prices do not mean free. These fields
  alone cannot establish a configured action's cost or a workflow total.
- `dataStrengths` — what this action is best at (editorial metadata)
- `whyUseful` — when to use this action
- `configuredTools` — existing tool instances in this workspace, each with:
  - `toolId` — identifies an already-configured instance of the action. Passing it when creating
    or updating a node does **not** share that instance: unless the node already uses it, the
    edit creates a new tool with the same action and credentials
  - `appAccountId` / `appAccountName` — bound credentials
  - `appAccountAbilities` — your abilities on those credentials (`null` when the tool binds none).
    `appAccountAbilities.canAccess: false` means the workspace has withheld this connection from you: binding
    it will be rejected, so pick another tool or another account rather than retrying
- `availableAppAccounts` — app accounts connected in this workspace for the action's provider,
  each with `id`, `name`, and `abilities` (`canAccess` / `canUpdate` / `canDelete`). This is every
  account the workspace has, not only yours: `abilities.canAccess: false` entries exist and cannot
  be bound. Present only when the action needs an API key and no usable configured tool exists
- `priorityTier` — lower is better (0 = functions, 1 = Clay first-party, 2 = has app account, 3 = Clay credits, 4 = requires key)
- `packageDisplayName` — human-readable provider name (e.g. "Salesforce"); **absent on workspace-function entries** (`priorityTier: 0`), so guard for it in jq (`.packageDisplayName // ""`)
- `actionLabels.type` — the action's capability type (e.g. `"Send Data"`); can be a single string **or an array of strings**, so match with both shapes in mind

The catalog has no input field names. **Before wiring any input, fetch the real
names with `clay workflows actions schema` (see below) — never guess them**, or
the node will silently fail to bind. `schema` also returns the same `outputParameters`
the catalog entry above carries, so once you've picked an action, one `schema` call
covers both directions instead of returning to the catalog for outputs.

### Using catalog data when adding tools

Every tool node gets its own tool instance — input mappings live on the tool, so a shared instance
would make one node's mappings overwrite another's (including nodes in other workflows). Node edits
enforce this: they only keep a tool the node already has, and otherwise create a new one.

1. **Add the action** — pass `actionKey` + `actionPackageId`:
   ```json
   {
     "toolType": "clay_action",
     "actionKey": "find-email-from-name",
     "actionPackageId": "..."
   }
   ```
2. **Bind specific credentials** — pass `appAccountId` from `availableAppAccounts`, choosing one whose
   `abilities.canAccess` is `true`. Otherwise the new tool binds a private workspace account for that
   provider when one exists, and falls back to Clay's own credentials (which cost credits) when it
   doesn't:
   ```json
   {
     "toolType": "clay_action",
     "actionKey": "...",
     "actionPackageId": "...",
     "appAccountId": "app_xyz"
   }
   ```

Fetch the catalog with the command below. If it fails (e.g. missing
credentials), run the `setup` skill first.

```bash
clay workflows actions list > /tmp/clay-actions-catalog.json
```

## How to search

The catalog is one big JSON object (`{ "data": [...] }`), kept fully greppable.
Search it for actions matching the user's request (`$ARGUMENTS`) with grep, or
filter structurally with jq:

```bash
grep -i "email" /tmp/clay-actions-catalog.json
jq -r '.data[] | select(.name | test("email";"i")) | "\(.priorityTier) \(.packageId) \(.actionKey) — \(.displayName)"' /tmp/clay-actions-catalog.json | sort
```

Prefer actions with lower `priorityTier` values and existing `configuredTools` — an action that
already has a configured tool usually has working credentials, which the new tool inherits. Skip
configured tools whose `appAccountAbilities.canAccess` is `false`: `priorityTier` does not account
for your access, so a tier-2 entry can still be one you are not allowed to bind.

### Never tell the user a capability is missing without searching for it first

The catalog is the source of truth for this workspace. Before you say something
like "there's no native Salesforce write action" or "you'll have to do that with
a raw API call", you MUST actually search the catalog for it — do not answer from
memory or from the user's phrasing. Provider write actions are the most commonly
missed, because their `displayName`s are generic ("Create Record", "Upsert
Object") and their `description`s rarely contain words like "write" or "sync", so
a naive keyword grep misses them. Search two ways before concluding anything:

1. **By provider**, using `packageDisplayName` (**absent on workspace-function
   entries** — guard it with `// ""` or the `test()` call throws on the first
   function and aborts before printing any real matches):
   ```bash
   jq -r '.data[] | select((.packageDisplayName // "") | test("salesforce";"i")) | "\(.packageId) \(.actionKey) — \(.displayName) [\(.actionLabels.type // "")]"' /tmp/clay-actions-catalog.json | sort
   ```
2. **By capability** (see the write-action note below).

Only after both searches genuinely come up empty may you say the capability is
unavailable — and phrase it as "I don't see it in _this workspace's_ catalog",
not "it doesn't exist" or "it isn't supported". When it's absent, give the user a
next step: suggest confirming the app/action is connected and enabled for the
workspace, and offer a concrete workaround rather than a flat no.

### Finding write / "send data" actions (CRM upserts, etc.)

Writing back to a CRM or other destination ("write to Salesforce", "create a
HubSpot contact", "update the record") is a native action — not something to
hand-roll with an HTTP call. These actions carry `"Send Data"` in
`actionLabels.type` (their tags usually include `CRM` and `EXPORT`). `type` can
be a single string or an array of strings — don't rely on `actionKey` naming to
spot them; each provider names its write actions differently (e.g. Salesforce's
`create-object`/`update-object`/`upsert-object`, HubSpot's
`hubspot-create-object`, Clay Labs' `upsert-audiences-record`). List every write
action available in the workspace with:

```bash
jq -r '.data[] | select(([.actionLabels.type] | flatten | index("Send Data"))) | "\(.packageDisplayName // ""): \(.actionKey) — \(.displayName)"' /tmp/clay-actions-catalog.json | sort
```

For Salesforce specifically the package is "Salesforce" and the write actions are
`create-object`, `update-object`, and `upsert-object`; `upsert-object` is usually
the right choice for "write back onto the record" (it needs an external ID
field). Confirm these are absent from the catalog before telling the user to pick
some other write-back mechanism.

### When several actions fit, recommend a default

The catalog almost always has multiple actions that do roughly the same job (several email finders, several company-enrichment providers, waterfalls vs. single providers, etc.). Use the request, `priorityTier`, configured credentials, coverage, and supported pricing internally to recommend and wire the best-supported default when the choice is reversible and low-risk. Follow the shared cost policy in `workflows-discover-actions/cost-and-budget.md` for cost disclosure and spending confirmation. Ask about consequential coverage, credentials, destination, or semantics trade-offs that the request does not resolve.

- Refer to each option by its **human-readable `displayName`** (e.g. "Find Work Email (Clay)"), never the internal `actionKey`.
- For each option, explain its relevant strengths and whether a usable connection exists. Discuss pricing only under the shared cost policy in `workflows-discover-actions/cost-and-budget.md`; keep catalog ranking and routine price comparisons internal.
- When every account for a provider has `abilities.canAccess: false`, say so plainly and tell the user to ask a workspace admin to grant them access to the connection — don't report the provider as unconnected, and don't try to bind it anyway.
- Name the default you chose (usually the lowest `priorityTier` with an existing configured tool) and let the user override it as the build evolves.

## Getting action input and output schemas

Run this for any action whose inputs you'll bind or whose results a downstream node
will address, and use the exact `name` / `outputPath` values it returns:

```bash
clay workflows actions schema <packageId> <actionKey>
```

Example:

```bash
clay workflows actions schema 56058efe-4757-4fe7-a44b-39c2d730c47a find-email-from-name
```

This returns the action's `packageId`, `actionKey`, `displayName`, `inputParameters`
(the input parameter schema), and `outputParameters` (the declared output fields,
flattened to leaf paths — available before the node has ever run). Select `options`
and `autocompleteOptions` are omitted by default because some actions carry thousands;
the response's `inputOptionsIncluded` says whether they are present. Pipe to
`jq '.inputParameters'` or `jq '.outputParameters'` to see just one side. When exact
choices or suggestions are needed for one input, request them and filter in the same
command so the full arrays do not enter the conversation:

```bash
clay workflows actions schema <packageId> <actionKey> --include-options \
  | jq '.inputParameters[] | select(.name == "<parameterName>") | { options, autocompleteOptions }'
```

An enrich
(tool) node stores the action payload under `result`, so an output's wiring path is
`$.result.<outputPath>` — see the workflows entry-point skill's `data-passing.md`
("Output
structure of enrich (tool) nodes") for the full addressing rules. `outputParameters`
comes back empty for actions that declare no output schema; in that case, run the
action once and read the paths off its result — `clay workflows actions test` (Sculptor:
`execute_clay_action`).

## Dynamic (input-dependent) fields

Some actions expose extra parameters only after an earlier input is chosen — e.g.
a CRM "create object" reveals a different field set per object type, and dependent
dropdowns whose options depend on a parent value. These are **not** in
`schema`'s `inputParameters`; resolve them with:

```bash
clay workflows actions dynamic-fields <packageId> <actionKey> <parameterPath> \
  --type select|input --account <appAccountId> --inputs '{"<driver>":"<value>"}'
```

`--type select` resolves a dependent dropdown's values; `--type input` resolves a
revealed field set (names come back pipe-namespaced, e.g. `fields|name`). It's
iterative — fill one input, re-run with it in `--inputs` for the next. See the
workflows entry-point skill's `data-passing.md` ("Discovering an action's dynamic
fields")
for the full flow and how the results map into `inputMappingConfig`.
