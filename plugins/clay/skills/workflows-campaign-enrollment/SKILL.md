# Enrolling people in a campaign from a workflow

If the action is absent from `clay workflows actions list`, this workspace does not have it — say so
rather than trying to work around it.

How the **Enroll in campaign** action works as a workflow step. For the workflow mechanics this
builds on (node creation, input mapping, `$.result.*` output paths), use the `/workflows` skill
and its `data-passing.md`.

Everything else about campaigns — reading them, writing sequence copy, analytics, variants — lives
behind `clay campaigns`, which is hidden in some products. Run `clay campaigns --help` before
offering any of it, and point the user at the Campaigns UI when it is absent.

One run of this step enrols **one** Audiences person into **one** campaign. It confirms enrollment,
not delivery: the email provider owns pacing from there.

**A successful run sends a real email.** Get the user's explicit confirmation before publishing or
test-running a workflow that contains this step.

## Attaching the action

- `actionKey: "enroll-lead-in-sequence"`
- `actionPackageId: "b1ab3d5d-b0db-4b30-9251-3f32d8b103c1"`

Two inputs, and they come from completely different places:

| Parameter    | Mapping       | Where the value comes from                      |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `campaignId` | `static` only | `clay workflows actions dynamic-fields` (below) |
| `entityId`   | `reference`   | an upstream Audiences step's record id (below)  |

Outputs, all under `$.result`: `enrollmentStatus` (`"enrolled"` or `"already_enrolled"` — both are
successes), `campaignId`, `entityId`, `email`, and `entityResolution` (`"provided"`, `"matched"`,
or `"created"`). Only the first four are declared output parameters, so `entityResolution` is in
the run result but never in `clay workflows actions schema` or a token picker.

## `campaignId` must be a static value

The campaign is a fixed choice, not per-run data. A `reference`, `item`, `llm`, or `map` mapping
is **rejected** with `inputMappingConfig key "campaignId" must be a static value`. Resolve a real
id first:

```bash
clay workflows actions dynamic-fields b1ab3d5d-b0db-4b30-9251-3f32d8b103c1 \
  enroll-lead-in-sequence campaignId --type select
```

That returns only campaigns that are **active** and take their leads from a workflow, so its
output is the only safe source for this value. Do **not** pick an id out of `clay campaigns list`:
most campaigns there draw leads from an audience instead, and pointing this step at one fails
every run with `campaign_not_workflow`.

Two outcomes are blocking, not retryable — report them to the user rather than trying again:

- `Couldn't load campaigns. Try again.` — the lookup itself failed.
- `No live campaigns take their leads from a workflow. Launch one to enroll.` — the workspace has
  no eligible campaign, and this step cannot be configured at all until it does. Launching is not
  something any skill can do; the user has to do it in the Campaigns UI.

## `entityId` is an Audiences record id

There are three supported ways to get one, and they answer different questions.

**Per-run (the normal case): take it from an upstream Audiences step.** Both
`upsert-audiences-record` and `update-audiences-record` return the record they touched as
`entityId`, so put one of them ahead of this step and wire its output through. `/workflows`'s
`audiences.md` covers configuring the upsert itself.

```json
{
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "record_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "sourceNodeId": "wfn_upsert",
        "sourcePath": "$.result.entityId"
      }
    }
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "toolType": "clay_action",
      "actionKey": "enroll-lead-in-sequence",
      "actionPackageId": "b1ab3d5d-b0db-4b30-9251-3f32d8b103c1",
      "inputMappingConfig": {
        "campaignId": { "type": "static", "value": "<id from dynamic-fields>" },
        "entityId": { "type": "reference", "expression": "{{record_id}}" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`sourcePath` must be `$.result.entityId`. `$.result` on its own passes the whole output object and
fails with `invalid_input` — an enrich step's outputs sit under `result`, per `/workflows`'s
`data-passing.md`.

**Looking a record up instead of writing one.** **Look up in Audiences** (`lookup-in-audiences`)
also carries the id, at `$.result.records[0].fields.id`. Use it when the person is already in
Audiences and the workflow has no reason to write to them. Three differences from the upsert route,
all of which bite:

- It declares **no output schema**, so `clay workflows actions schema` returns an empty
  `outputParameters` and there is no field-level token to pick. Run the action once and read the
  path off `.result` before wiring it — see `/workflows`'s `data-passing.md`.
- It returns a **list** capped by `limit`, so you must index `records[0]`. A lookup that matches
  nothing returns an empty array, and the enrol step then fails `invalid_input`.
- It cannot create anyone. If the workflow might be seeing a new person, use the upsert route —
  that is the difference that decides between them.

**A fixed record (testing, or a workflow that always targets the same person):**
`clay audiences records search-ids --entity-type people …` returns matching ids; map one as a
`static` value. This is wrong for a workflow meant to enrol whoever it just processed.

## Before it will run

- The campaign must be **active**. A paused or draft campaign rejects every enrollment.
- The person needs an email address on their record, plus any field the campaign copy marks
  required.

A contact and an account created by the _same_ upstream upsert are not yet linked in a way this
step can read, so company tokens in the copy render blank on that first enrollment. Enrich or
associate the account in an earlier run if the copy depends on it.

## Failure codes

Every failure carries one of these codes, and the message alongside it is safe to relay verbatim.
This is the whole set — a code outside it means the step failed before enrollment was attempted.

| Code                                 | Means                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contact_not_found`                  | no such record, or it belongs to another workspace / is deleted |
| `ambiguous_identity`                 | the record could not be resolved to a single person             |
| `canonical_email_mismatch`           | the record has no usable email address                          |
| `missing_required_fields`            | the record is missing data the campaign copy requires           |
| `campaign_not_active`                | the campaign is not active                                      |
| `campaign_not_workflow`              | that campaign takes its leads from an audience, not a workflow  |
| `campaign_not_found`                 | the campaign no longer exists                                   |
| `lead_in_cooldown`                   | enrolled in a related campaign too recently                     |
| `cooldown_check_unavailable`         | the cooldown could not be checked                               |
| `insufficient_credits`               | the workspace is out of credits for this enrollment             |
| `snippet_generation_failed`          | the campaign's AI snippets could not be generated               |
| `provider_rejected`                  | the email provider refused this person (blocklist, unsubscribe) |
| `invalid_input`                      | usually a `sourcePath` that passed an object instead of the id  |
| `feature_disabled`                   | enrollment from workflows is off for this workspace             |
| `provider_result_indeterminate`      | the provider's answer could not be confirmed                    |
| `enrollment_persistence_unavailable` | the enrollment result could not be recorded                     |
| `unexpected_error`                   | an unhandled failure                                            |

`provider_result_indeterminate` and `enrollment_persistence_unavailable` mean the person **may
already be enrolled**. Re-running the step can send a second email, so report them and let the user
check the campaign rather than retrying.

## Testing a step without enrolling anyone

`clay campaigns variants send-test` cannot preview a workflow-fed campaign — it looks for a
preview lead in an audience, and these campaigns have none. Sending a test render of the copy is
only possible from the step's own panel in the app today. Say so rather than sending a real
enrollment to check the copy.
