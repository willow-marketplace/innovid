name: routines
description: Clay routines — create a routine from an existing function/workflow, then run a saved routine that exists in this workspace. Use when the user asks to create/register a routine, or to run, execute, or trigger a function, workflow, or routine (by name or id), pass it inputs, or check the results/status of a run. For building a new workflow, use the workflows entry-point skill instead.

# Running Clay routines

A **routine** is the runnable unit in Clay: a saved **function** or **workflow** that
already exists in this workspace. This skill is about _running_ an existing routine and
getting its results — not building one.

- To **build or edit** a workflow, use the workflows entry-point skill.
- To **query data** out of a Clay table, use the tables entry-point skill.
- To **find the records** to run a routine over, use the `searches` skill for net-new people
  or companies, or the `audiences` skill for members of a saved audience, then feed the
  results in here.
- To **write people or companies into Audiences**, run a routine whose underlying
  workflow contains `upsert-audiences-record` (for example, to persist Search results).
  Items pipe in the same as other runs, using `workflow:<id>` instead of `function:<id>`.
  If no such workflow exists, build it via the `workflows` skill's
  `audiences.md`, then `clay routines create workflow`.
- To run a routine **over HTTP** from a service or app (not a one-off shell task), use
  the `public-api` skill.

Routines run **asynchronously**: you start a run, then poll for results.

## 1. Find the routine

Don't assume a routine id. List what exists and match the user's request to one:

```bash
clay routines list            # routines in this workspace
clay routines get <id>        # full config and input schema
```

`clay routines list` is **paginated** — a workspace can have far more routines than one
page. Page through with `--cursor` until the response has no `cursor` before concluding a
routine doesn't exist. Each routine carries a `source` field in the response — `list` has no
filter flag, so filter client-side (e.g. `| jq '.data | map(select(.source == "managed"))'`).
`managed` routines are Clay's built-in enrichers
(emails, domains, firmographics) and should be your first choice for standard enrichment;
`custom` are workspace-built. Decide by **input schema**, not name — e.g. the managed
**Work Email** routine needs Full Name + Company Name + Company Domain, so resolve the
domain first with the managed **Company Domain** routine when you only have a company name.

`clay routines get <id>` is important before running: it shows the routine's **input
schema** so you know exactly which fields each item needs.

### Link the user to the underlying function or workflow

Whenever you show the user a routine — from `clay routines list` or `clay routines get` —
give them a link to open its underlying object in the Clay app so they can inspect or edit
it. This matters most in a headless environment (Claude Code, Cursor, a shell) where the
user has no Clay tab open.

A routine id encodes the object it wraps: `function:<tableId>` wraps a table,
`workflow:<workflowId>` wraps a workflow. Split off the id after the `:` and combine it
with the workspace id (`clay whoami | jq -r '.workspace.id'`) to build the link:

- **Function** (`function:<tableId>`) → `https://app.clay.com/workspaces/<workspaceId>/tables/<tableId>`
- **Workflow** (`workflow:<workflowId>`) → `https://app.clay.com/workspaces/<workspaceId>/terracotta/tc-workflows/<workflowId>`

For **function** routines, both `list` and `get` return a `source` (`managed` for a
Clay-managed default function, `custom` for one built in this workspace) and, for custom
functions, a `createdBy` (`{ id, name, email }`; `null` for managed ones). Use these to tell
the user which functions are Clay-managed vs. their team's own, and who authored a custom
one — e.g. group them by `source`, or note the author when disambiguating similar functions.

### Create a routine from an existing function or workflow

If no routine exists yet for a function (a table) or a workflow, expose it as a runnable
routine with `create`. This registers the underlying object as a routine.

```bash
clay routines create function <tableId> --name "My contact routine" --entity-type contact
clay routines create workflow <workflowId> --name "My workflow routine"
```

- `type` is `function` or `workflow`; `objectId` is the table id (function) or workflow id.
- `--name` is **required** for both types.
- `--entity-type` (`contact` or `company`) is **required** for function routines and rejected
  for workflow routines.
- The routine id is built from the type and object id, e.g. `function:t_abc`.

Use `clay routines update <id>` to change a routine's name, description, or entity-type
later. See `clay routines create --help` / `clay routines update --help` for the full flags
and JSON shape.

## 2. Check the cost and your balance before running

Before starting a run, inspect its estimate and the workspace balance internally. Follow
the shared cost policy in `workflows-discover-actions/cost-and-budget.md` for disclosure and confirmation; ordinary authorized
runs do not need a cost-only check-in. `clay routines get <id>` includes a per-item estimate;
`clay credits balance` returns the remaining balance.

```bash
clay routines get function:t_abc123 | jq '.estimatedCreditCost'
clay credits balance | jq '{ balance, actionExecutionBalance }'
```

There are **two independent budgets**, and a run needs enough of each:

- `estimatedCreditCost.perRun` is charged against the data-credit `balance`.
- `estimatedCreditCost.actionExecution` (when supplied) is charged against the separate
  `actionExecutionBalance` on action-execution pricing plans. A workspace can have plenty
  of `balance` but no action executions left — enough of one budget does not cover the other. When not supplied the workspace is still on legacy billing and this balance can be ignored

For how to read the balance and how the cost fields work, see the help text:

```bash
clay credits balance --help
```

Only multiply per-item costs when they apply to the configured execution and all relevant
execution counts are known. Workflow estimates count nodes once and can omit branching
and fan-out; `containsVariablePricing: false` does not establish completeness. Do not turn
an incomplete base estimate into a total, even by labeling it approximate.

If a supported estimated total for **either**
budget exceeds its matching balance — `perRun × items > balance`, or
`actionExecution × items > actionExecutionBalance` — stop and tell the user instead of
starting a run that will only partially complete.

Undefined, null, incomplete, or inapplicable costs are unknown, not free. If asked, explain
that the total cannot be reliably estimated; otherwise continue within the authorized scope.

### Running low? Share a top-up link

When supported pricing shows insufficient balance, or a real billing failure occurs, read the
`credits-quotas-plans` skill and follow it for CLI top-up, auto top-up, and
billing UI options.

## 3. Run it

Start an async run, passing inputs per item:

```bash
clay routines runs start <id>     # see --help for how to pass items/inputs
```

- A single inline run takes **1-100 items**; each item is a set of `inputs` matching the
  routine's input schema.
- For larger sets, routines support a **batch** run over an uploaded JSONL file.

Run `clay routines runs start --help` for the exact flags, the input/JSON shape, and how
to supply items.

## 4. Get the results

Runs are asynchronous. Prefer a single blocking call with `--wait` instead of hand-rolling a
poll loop:

```bash
clay routines runs get <run-id> --wait 60        # poll until complete / validation_failed / processing_failed, or 60s
clay routines runs get <run-id> --bulk --wait 60 # same for a bulk run (skip the inline probe)
clay routines runs get <run-id> --wait           # poll until complete / validation_failed / processing_failed (no budget)
clay routines runs get <run-id>                  # single request (may still be in_progress)
clay routines runs get <run-id> --bulk           # look up as a bulk run (bare flag, no value)
clay routines runs list                          # recent runs and their statuses
```

Check `.status` on the JSON before treating the run as done. With bare `--wait`, the command
blocks until `complete`, `validation_failed`, or `processing_failed`. With `--wait <seconds>`, if the budget expires
while still `in_progress`, the command exits 0 with that latest status — do not assume success.
Prefer a bounded `--wait <seconds>` for bulk runs: a bulk run that was stopped keeps reporting
`in_progress`, so bare `--wait` can wait forever.

Every response carries a `mode` of `inline` or `bulk`, and so does the output of
`runs start`. When it is `bulk`, pass `--bulk` on `runs get` so the run is looked up directly.
If you don't know the mode — a run id you were handed, or one from `runs list`, which does not
report it — omit `--bulk`; the response tells you the mode.

A completed bulk run reports a `resultUrl` rather than inline `data`. That URL is short-lived
(minutes) — download it promptly, and re-run `runs get --bulk` to mint a fresh one rather
than reusing a stale link. Results stay retrievable for about a day after the run finishes,
after which the id stops resolving.

Per-item results come back with a status (`complete` / `failed`) and either a `result`
or an `error`.

`clay routines runs get` returns a single page of inline results. Since an inline run
has at most 100 items, `--limit 100` returns every result in one page. If you use a
smaller page size, the response includes a top-level `cursor` when more results remain —
pass it back via `--cursor` to fetch the next page.
