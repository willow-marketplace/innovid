# Shared approval hook for the Clay plugin across Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.
# Each agent prompts before running shell commands; this auto-approves a `clay`
# CLI call (optionally piped through a small set of read-only helpers, or
# `;`-chained with only `clay` / `echo` / `printf` clauses) so the plugin stops
# asking on every invocation. The verdict shape differs per agent, selected by
# the first argument: claude | cursor | codex.
#
#   claude -> PreToolUse           (input .tool_input.command)
#   codex  -> PermissionRequest    (input .tool_input.command)
#   cursor -> beforeShellExecution (input .command)
#
# "allow" only skips the prompt; deny/ask rules (including managed deny lists)
# still take precedence, so this can't punch through an admin block. Conservative
# by design: any command that redirects, substitutes, or expands the environment
# (`&`, `&&`, `||`, `>`, `<`, backticks, `$(…)`, any `$` parameter expansion
# like `$VAR`/`${VAR}`, or a backslash escape `\`) falls through to the normal
# prompt rather than being approved. Unquoted `|` and `;` are allowed as segment
# breaks under the rules below (see the awk pass); quoted `|`/`;` inside args
# are not separators. Semicolon clauses are stricter than pipes: file-reading
# helpers (`cat`, `jq`, …) are pipe-only, so `cat .env; clay whoami` cannot
# auto-approve and dump a cwd file into the agent context.

agent="${1:-claude}"

# Pipeline helpers allowed alongside `clay` when joined by `|`. Read-only by
# intent; this is the security-relevant surface, kept in one place for review.
# `echo`/`printf` never open a file or socket, so they are exempt from the
# path/file-flag guards below -- but unquoted glob/tilde chars are still
# refused for every helper (including echo/printf), on both `|` and `;`, so
# pathname/extglob/brace/tilde/=path expansion can't turn `echo .*` into a cwd
# listing under auto-approve.
# Semicolon-chained clauses may only use `clay`, `echo`, or `printf` (not the
# rest of this list).

# Validate the pipeline/chain in a single quote-aware pass. awk first splits on

# a `|` or `;` inside jq/grep args or a quoted clay arg is not a separator; the
# `\`-reject guard above keeps this splitter in sync with the shell), trims
# surrounding whitespace per segment, then:
#   - any segment that leads with a `VAR=value` env-var assignment is rejected
#     outright -- we never vet the variable, so a prefix like `LD_PRELOAD=`,
#     `CLAY_API_URL=`, or `CLAY_CONFIG_HOME=` must not ride in as a plain call;
#   - at least one segment across all clauses must be `clay` (its own path/URL
#     args are left alone), so the pipeline/chain stays anchored to a clay call
#     wherever it sits;
#   - the `clay` segment's first non-flag word is refused if it is a
#     credential/egress subcommand (feedback, login, logout, api-keys,
#     webhooks) or if its leading non-flag words match any gated prefix
#     (e.g. credits top-up) so billing checkout never auto-approves;
#     non-flag words are dequoted before option classification and gate compare,
#     and each gate-compared prefix word must match ^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$
#     so shell-expansion tokens cannot slip past a literal prefix match;
#     `clay credits balance` still auto-approves;
#   - within a `|` pipeline that contains `clay`, every other segment's command
#     must be in the helper allowlist (membership is an exact key lookup, so a
#     token like `*` can't wildcard its way in);
#   - semicolon clauses with no `clay` may only be `echo` or `printf` -- not
#     file-reading helpers -- so `cat .env; clay whoami` cannot auto-approve
#     and print a cwd file straight into the agent context;
#   - every helper segment (including echo/printf, on both `|` and `;`) must
#     not contain an unquoted shell metacharacter (`*`, `?`, `[`, `]`, `~`,
#     `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, or word-leading `=`) -- not an exhaustive shell
#     parser, but enough to block pathname/extglob/brace/tilde/=path expansion
#     so `echo .*` / `cat *.env` can't become a cwd listing under
#     auto-approve; mid-word `=` (e.g. `--filter key=value`), `@` in values
#     (e.g. `test@example.com`), and bare `+`/`!`/`^` (which only reach
#     extglob via the already-refused `(`) are allowed; quoted forms like
#     `echo "*"` are fine;
#   - every non-echo/printf helper segment must not reference a path (`/`, `~`)
#     or a read/write file flag (long `--output`/`--file` or short clusters
#     containing `o`/`f`, attached value or not) -- helpers must transform
#     stdin, not open files. These checks apply to helpers on both sides of
#     clay, so neither `cat /etc/passwd | clay` nor `clay | cat /etc/passwd`
#     slips by, and `clay | sort -oPWNED.txt` can't write a cwd file; quoted
#     text is scanned too, so cat "/etc/passwd" can't either. `echo` and
#     `printf` are exempt from the path/flag guards (a `/` in their args is
#     data -- JSON, a URL -- not a file read) but not from the unquoted
#     shell-metachar guard. The `$`-reject guard above is what keeps remaining
#     args literal -- otherwise `printf "$SECRET"` would expand an env var
#     into clay's stdin under the echo/printf exemption.
# Residual, knowingly accepted for `|` only: bare cwd-relative names (e.g.
# `cat .env | clay`) aren't caught; since no allowlisted helper can reach the
# network or redirect, such a read stays in the agent's context and still can't
# be exfiltrated without a separate, non-approved (prompted) command. Semicolon
# chaining no longer widens that residual to standalone helper stdout.
