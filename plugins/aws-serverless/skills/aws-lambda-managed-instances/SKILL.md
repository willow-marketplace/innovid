# AWS Lambda Managed Instances (LMI)

Run Lambda functions on current-generation EC2 instances in your account while AWS manages provisioning, patching, scaling, routing, and load balancing. Combines Lambda's developer experience with EC2's pricing and hardware options.

For standard Lambda development, see [aws-lambda skill](../aws-lambda/). For SAM/CDK deployment, see [aws-serverless-deployment skill](../aws-serverless-deployment/).

## Quick Decision: Is LMI Right for This Workload?

| Signal         | LMI is a strong fit                                                                     | Standard Lambda is better                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Traffic        | Steady, predictable, 50M+ req/mo                                                        | Bursty, unpredictable, long idle                       |
| Cost           | Duration-heavy spend at scale                                                           | Low or sporadic invocations                            |
| Cold starts    | Unacceptable (LMI eliminates for provisioned capacity; scale-out may have brief delays) | Tolerable or mitigated by SnapStart                    |
| Compute        | Latest CPUs, specific families, high network bandwidth                                  | Standard Lambda memory/CPU sufficient                  |
| Isolation      | Dedicated EC2 instances in your account, full VPC control                               | Shared Firecracker micro-VMs acceptable                |
| Scale-to-zero  | Not needed (execution environments always running)                                      | Required (pay nothing when idle)                       |
| Code readiness | Thread-safe (Node.js/Java/.NET) or any Python code                                      | Non-thread-safe Node.js/Java/.NET, expensive to change |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Assess the Workload

Gather these signals before recommending:

1. **Traffic pattern**: Steady vs bursty? Requests per second?
2. **Current costs**: Monthly Lambda spend? Existing Savings Plans?
3. **Runtime**: Node.js, Java, .NET, or Python?
4. **Memory/CPU**: How much memory? CPU-bound or I/O-bound?
5. **Execution duration**: Average and P99?
6. **Concurrency readiness**: Thread safety (Node.js/Java/.NET)? Shared `/tmp` paths? Per-invocation DB connections?
7. **VPC**: Already in a VPC? Private resource access needed?

#### Deriving LMI Configuration from Metrics

If Lambda Insights is enabled on the function, use these metrics to calculate your starting configuration. If Lambda Insights is not enabled, suggest adding it to gather accurate workload data — but only proceed with the user's explicit confirmation, as adding the Insights layer may affect function performance or cold start times.

To check if Lambda Insights is enabled, look for a LambdaInsightsExtension layer on the function. To add it, find the latest layer ARN for your region from the [Lambda Insights documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights-extension-versions.html) and attach the `CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy` managed policy to the function's execution role.

**Target max concurrency** (from `cpu_total_time` and `Duration`):

```
PerExecutionEnvironmentMaxConcurrency = floor((0.5 × Duration) / cpu_total_time)
```

This targets 50% CPU utilization at full concurrency, leaving headroom for scaling.

**Memory allocation** (from `memory_utilization` and current memory):

```
MemorySize = min(32768, max(2048, MaxConcurrency × (memory_utilization / 100) × current_allocated_memory))
```

This overestimates (assumes no shared base memory) but provides a safe starting point. The outer `min` caps the result at the 32 GB (32768 MB) LMI maximum.

**Minimum execution environments** (from baseline `ConcurrentExecutions`):

```
MinExecutionEnvironments = max(3, ceil(baseline_concurrent_executions × 2 / MaxConcurrency))
```

Targets 50% concurrency utilization to leave headroom for traffic bursts.

**Without Lambda Insights:** Start with the runtime's default max concurrency, 2 GB memory, and MinExecutionEnvironments = 3. Adjust during testing.

### Step 2: Build the Cost Comparison

REQUIRED: Present a cost comparison before recommending LMI. Compare at minimum:

| Scenario         | When it wins                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Lambda on-demand | Low volume, bursty traffic  |
| LMI on-demand    | High volume, steady traffic |

Rule of thumb: LMI becomes cost-competitive when your Lambda spend exceeds ~$1,000/month with steady traffic.

For discount analysis (Savings Plans, Reserved Instances), refer users to the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) and [references/cost-comparison.md](references/cost-comparison.md) for formulas and worked examples. Discount recommendations require workload-specific forecasting beyond this skill's scope.

### Step 3: Configure the Deployment

**Instance families** (~450 types): C-series (compute, .xlarge+), M-series (general, .large+), R-series (memory, .large+). ARM (Graviton) for best price-performance.

**Memory-to-vCPU ratios**: 2:1 (default, CPU-bound work), 4:1 (general/mixed workloads), 8:1 (memory-heavy or Python apps). Min 2 GB, max 32 GB.

**Multi-concurrency defaults/vCPU**: Node.js 64, Java 32, .NET 32, Python 16.

**Scaling**: MinExecutionEnvironments (default 3), MaxVCpuCount (default 400), TargetResourceUtilization.

**Scheduled scaling**: For predictable traffic (business hours, marketing events), use EventBridge Scheduler to adjust Min/Max execution environments on a one-time or recurring schedule — scale up before peak, scale down or to zero when idle.

See [references/configuration-guide.md](references/configuration-guide.md) for decision trees and detailed tuning.

### Step 4: Migrate the Code

Review code for concurrency safety. LMI runs multiple invocations concurrently per execution environment, but the model differs by runtime:

- **Python**: Process-based isolation — globals are NOT shared. No thread-safety changes needed. Focus on `/tmp` conflicts and memory sizing (per-process × concurrency).
- **Node.js**: Worker threads — globals shared within a worker. Requires async safety. Callback handlers not supported on Node.js 22.
- **Java/.NET**: OS threads/Tasks — handler shared across threads. Requires full thread safety.

**Common issues (all runtimes)**: shared `/tmp` paths, per-invocation DB connections.
**Thread-safety issues (Node.js/Java/.NET only)**: mutable globals, non-thread-safe libs.

See [references/thread-safety.md](references/thread-safety.md) for the review checklist and [references/migration-patterns.md](references/migration-patterns.md) for runtime-specific before/after code.

### Step 5: Set Up Infrastructure

1. Create two IAM roles: execution role (for the function) and operator role (for capacity provider EC2 management)
2. Configure VPC with subnets across multiple AZs (recommended 3+ for resiliency)
3. Create capacity provider with VPC config and scaling limits
4. Create or update function with capacity provider attachment
5. Publish a version (triggers instance provisioning)

See [references/infrastructure-setup.md](references/infrastructure-setup.md) for CLI commands and SAM templates.

### Step 6: Validate and Cut Over

1. Deploy to a non-production environment first
2. Monitor CloudWatch: CPU utilization, memory, concurrency, throttle rate. If you observe low CPU utilization or ongoing throttles, see [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for metric-specific adjustment guidance.
3. Shift traffic to the LMI function (note: weighted alias shifting between LMI and non-LMI functions is not currently supported)
4. Compare costs after 1-2 weeks of production data
5. Decommission standard Lambda once stable

## Best Practices

### Configuration

- Do: Start with 2:1 ratio and runtime default concurrency
- Do: Use ARM (Graviton) unless x86 dependencies exist
- Do: Let Lambda choose instance types unless specific hardware needed
- Do: Set MaxVCpuCount to control cost ceiling
- Don't: Set MinExecutionEnvironments below 3 in production (reduces multi-AZ coverage). Non-prod environments can use 1 as the minimum.
- Don't: Over-restrict instance types (lowers availability)

### Migration

- Do: Start with I/O-heavy functions (benefit most from multi-concurrency; CPU-bound functions compete for same CPU)
- Do: Review code for concurrency safety before attaching to capacity provider (thread safety for Node.js/Java/.NET; `/tmp` and memory for Python)
- Do: Plan traffic shifting strategy based on your invocation source (weighted alias shifting between LMI and non-LMI functions is not currently supported)
- Do: Include request IDs in all log statements
- Do: Initialize DB pools and SDK clients outside the handler
- Do: Estimate total `/tmp` usage under max concurrency
- Don't: Write to hardcoded `/tmp` paths without request-unique naming
- Don't: Skip cost comparison — LMI is not always cheaper

### Operations

- Do: Set CloudWatch alarms on throttle rate > 1% and CPU > 80%
- Do: Use scheduled scaling (EventBridge Scheduler) for predictable traffic — raise Min/Max before peak periods and lower them (or scale to zero) when idle
- Don't: Manually terminate LMI EC2 instances (delete the capacity provider instead)
- Don't: Forget to publish a version — unpublished functions cannot run on LMI
- Don't: Rely on a deactivated (Min=Max=0) function to self-recover — schedule an explicit scale-up to reactivate it
