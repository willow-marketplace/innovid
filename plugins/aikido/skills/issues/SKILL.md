name: issues
description: List, count, summarize, or triage security issues from the Aikido security feed. Use when the user asks about Aikido findings, vulnerabilities, leaked secrets, SAST/IaC/SCA results, cloud or container security issues, or EOL/license/malware alerts surfaced by Aikido.
---
When listing Aikido feed issues:

1. Use **aikido-mcp:aikido_issues_list**
2. Call it when the user wants to list, show, count, or summarize Aikido feed issues.
3. Pass scope fields only when the user (or workspace context) supplies them: `cloud_name`, `repo_name`, `vm_name`, `domain_name`, `container_name`.
4. Optional `issue_types` (array): `open_source`, `leaked_secret`, `cloud`, `sast`, `iac`, `surface_monitoring`, `malware`, `eol`, `mobile`, `docker_container`, `cloud_instance`, `scm_security`, `license`, `ai_pentest` — e.g. include `leaked_secret` for secrets. Omit when no category filter is needed.
5. Pagination: use numeric `page` only when the user needs more than the first page of results (zero-indexed). Only 25 findings are reported per page. Report to the user if there are more findings on following pages.
6. Present each issue exactly in this form (increment `#`):
   ```
   Issue #1: <issue_title>
    - Issue type: <issue_type>
    - Severity: <issue_severity>
    - Remediation: <issue_remediation>
   ```

If the Aikido MCP server is not available or fails, inform the user:

> The Aikido MCP server is required for Aikido feed issues but is not available.
> Install it following the setup guide at [reference.md](../scan/reference.md), or run `/aikido:setup`, then retry.
