description: Chart GrowthBook product data, build Analytics dashboards, manage the metric catalog, or query the warehouse directly — run Product Analytics explorations, save charts together on a dashboard, search metrics and fact tables, create fact metrics and their fact tables, or fall back to ad-hoc SQL. Use for "show me signups by country", "chart daily active users", "how many orders last week", "build me a dashboard", "put these metrics on a dashboard", "add a chart to this dashboard", "set up reporting for X", "find our revenue metric", "what fact tables exist", "create a metric", "define a metric on the orders table", "what tables contain user data", "run a SQL query", or any "show me / chart / plot / how many" question about product data. For an A/B test's results or choosing experiment metrics, use experiments. For feature flags, use feature-flags. For first-time API key configuration, use gb-setup.

# analytics

Domain router for GrowthBook Product Analytics, Analytics dashboards, and the metric catalog. The workflows live in `references/`. Read this router, pick one, then read that file and follow it.

Analytics uses the **v1 API** — `/api/v1/product-analytics/search`, `/columns`, and `/column-values` for discovery, the metric, fact-table, data-source, and funnel `/api/v1/product-analytics/*-exploration` endpoints for charts, `/api/v1/product-analytics/explorations/:id` for polling, `/dashboards` for saved pages of charts, and `/fact-metrics` and `/fact-tables` for the catalog. The API also exposes SQL explorations, but this skill does not construct or execute arbitrary SQL exploration payloads.

All API calls go through the bundled helper. Under the Claude Code plugin install, it lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gb-call` (the plugin root). Under `npx skills install`, it lives at `scripts/gb-call` relative to this skill's directory. Resolve that path once and substitute it whenever a reference example says `gb-call`; do not assume `gb-call` is on `PATH`. It reads `GB_API_KEY` from the environment first, then falls back to `~/.config/growthbook/.env` (written by **gb-setup**); environment variables take precedence.

## Pick a workflow

| Read this                         | When the user wants to                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `references/metric-search.md`     | Browse, find, or audit metrics and fact tables — inventory, a specific definition, or "what can I chart" triage (read-only) |
| `references/metric-create.md`     | Create a fact metric, creating its underlying fact table first when necessary (writes configuration)                       |
| `references/analytics-explore.md` | Actually run a chart and report the numbers plus a deep link                                                                |
| `references/dashboard-create.md`  | Build a new dashboard — several charts saved together on one page (writes a dashboard)                                     |
| `references/dashboard-edit.md`    | Change a dashboard that already exists: add or remove a chart, swap a metric, change the timeframe, rename it               |
| `references/sql-query.md`         | Run ad-hoc SQL against the warehouse when no metric or exploration can answer the question (last resort)                     |

When the user names a metric you have not resolved yet, read `metric-search.md` first. It hands `analytics-explore` or `metric-create` a stable definition. When they already named something concrete and just want the numbers, go straight to `analytics-explore.md`.

One chart or several? A single question gets one chart from `analytics-explore`. "Track", "monitor", "reporting", or two or more things to watch together means a dashboard. Route on whether the dashboard exists: no id yet is `dashboard-create`, an id is `dashboard-edit`.

Use `sql-query.md` only when the question can't be answered with existing metrics or the exploration config — custom joins, unmodeled tables, or aggregations the exploration can't express.

## Shared conventions

- **Only fact metrics chart.** `fact__...` ids work in Product Analytics; legacy `met_...` metrics from `/api/v1/metrics` are valid experiment metrics but cannot be charted. Never promise a chart for one.
- **Explorations are datasource-scoped, and the datasource must be a SQL warehouse.** Mixpanel and Google Analytics datasources can't run explorations.
- **Pass ids, not display names, between workflows.** Names aren't unique. Fact metric ids always start `fact__`; fact table ids default to `ftb_...` but can be custom, so don't filter on that prefix.
- **Every id comes from a lookup or from the user's `@` mention — never construct one.** Some are readable (`fact__demo-d7-purchase-retention`) and invite a guess like `fact__AverageOrderValue`; those resolve to nothing, and the failure surfaces late and obscurely.
- **Discover before constructing.** Use Product Analytics search and columns, and call column-values before using any concrete filter or breakdown value. Never guess a value.
- **Check before creating.** Prefer an existing `official: true` metric over adding a duplicate with the same meaning.
- **A `200` from an exploration POST is not necessarily success.** Branch on `exploration.status`; poll `running` explorations by id, surface `error`, and note that `cache=required` can return `exploration: null`.
- **Handle workflow-endpoint 404s conservatively.** A 404 from `/product-analytics/search` means the server predates these endpoints. On `/columns`, `/column-values`, or `/explorations/:id`, it can also mean the resource is missing or inaccessible. Surface the failure and stop; never probe around access checks, substitute an undocumented endpoint, or re-POST a running exploration.
- **Use the returned full result rows for numeric insights.** Do not infer values from a chart preview, truncated summary, or config.
- **Run at most one successful chart per user turn.** Discovery, polling, and one empty-result retry are allowed; once one non-empty exploration succeeds, answer from it unless the user explicitly asks for another chart in a later turn.
- **Always set `unit` explicitly** on every `dataset.values[]` entry — that is the only level that takes one; a `unit` on the config itself is rejected. For metrics, follow `/columns` exactly: when `metrics[].needsUnit` is true, choose a returned `userIdTypes` entry; when it is false, default to `null`. A unit is an **identifier type**, never a value format such as `currency`. The server does not backfill a missing unit.
- **A date range's `predefined` is a closed list**, everywhere one appears: `today`, `yesterday`, `last7Days`, `last30Days`, `last90Days`, `last12Months`, `lastCalendarYear`, `customLookback`, `customDateRange`. Any other name is rejected, so every window outside the list is `customLookback` with `lookbackValue` and `lookbackUnit` (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`).
- **`dimensionType` is a closed set**, and `"dimension"` is not in it: `date`, `dynamic`, `static`, `slice`. Only the first two are supported — a date axis is `{ "dimensionType": "date", "column": null, "dateGranularity": "auto" }` and a breakdown by column is `{ "dimensionType": "dynamic", "column": "browser", "maxValues": 5 }`. Naming the field after what you want to group by is the guess the validator rejects.
- **Never re-send a rejected call unchanged.** A 400 is deterministic: the same body gets the same error, so a retry that has not changed the field the message names only spends the user's turn. Read `body.message`, fix exactly what it names, and send it once more. If the message does not say what a valid value would be, or the same field is rejected twice, stop there — say which field failed and what you tried, and ask the user rather than guessing a third time. Ask about **that field**: a validation error names the field it rejected, and a question about a different one (a column name, a metric choice) cannot resolve it, so the answer arrives and the same call fails again.
- **Restyling a chart is free.** Cache matching ignores `chartType`, so a different chart type on the same query is a cache hit. Never re-query just to restyle.
- **A dashboard's chart blocks carry a `config`, not a result.** The create and update calls run every chart server-side, so never POST an exploration first just to get an id for a tile.
- **An update replaces a dashboard's whole block list.** Read the dashboard in the same turn you write it, and list every tile being kept — but carry an unchanged one as `{ "id": "dshblk_…" }` rather than copying it back in full.
- **Dashboards are not scoped to a datasource** the way metrics and explorations are, but every chart on one is.

## Read-only vs. write

`metric-search` is strictly read-only. `analytics-explore` runs warehouse queries but changes no GrowthBook configuration — it does not create metrics, fact tables, or dashboards. `sql-query` is similar: it never mutates warehouse data, but it executes potentially costly queries and persists a GrowthBook exploration object from the results. `metric-create` writes organization-visible fact-table and fact-metric definitions, and `dashboard-create` / `dashboard-edit` write dashboards; all three must summarize the change in plain language and get confirmation before each write.

Note that explorations execute real warehouse queries, so they cost the user money and time even though they write nothing — and a dashboard write runs one per chart block. Scope them the way the reference files describe rather than fanning out speculatively.

## Handoffs

- The **experiments** skill — when the question is an A/B test readout, or when a chart surfaces something worth testing.
- The **feature-flags** skill — when the user pivots to shipping or gating the thing the data is about.
- **gb-setup** — when `gb-call` reports a missing or invalid `GB_API_KEY`.
