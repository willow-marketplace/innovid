name: dashboard-create
description: Build a new GrowthBook Analytics dashboard from a goal or a set of metrics — settle the brief, pick the blocks, and create it in one call. Use when the user asks to "build me a dashboard", "make a dashboard for X", "put these metrics on a dashboard", "I want to track X and Y", or "set up reporting for X". For changing a dashboard that already exists, use dashboard-edit. For a single one-off chart, use analytics-explore.

# dashboard-create

Create a general (Product Analytics) dashboard: a saved page of chart tiles over the metrics and fact tables the organization already has.

Chart blocks carry a `config` and nothing else. The create call runs every one of them server-side and wires the results onto the tiles, so this workflow never runs an exploration of its own — one write, one confirmation, one dashboard.

It deliberately stops at creation. Renaming, re-scoping, and adding or removing tiles afterwards belong to `dashboard-edit`.

## Workflow

### 1. Pick the datasource

Each chart carries its own `config.datasource`, so one dashboard can span several. This step picks the **default** — the source a chart uses when nothing else pins it, and the one to browse when the user named no metrics. Step 4 can add more: a named metric brings its own datasource with it. If one is already established in this conversation, reuse it.

```bash
gb-call GET /api/v1/data-sources
```

Mixpanel and Google Analytics cannot run explorations. Drop them from the list first, then count what is left:

- **0** → tell the user no chartable datasource is configured, and stop there.
- **1** → use it and say which one.
- **2+** → use the one the user named; otherwise ask.

### 2. Settle the name and the project

These are the two things the user cannot fix afterwards without a separate edit, so settle both before building.

- **Name** — use the user's own words. Ask when they gave none.
- **Project** — `gb-call GET /api/v1/projects`. None or one → send `[]` or that single id without asking. Two or more and the user named none → ask. `[]` means visible in every project.

Ask for both in one question, not two round-trips.

### 3. Pick the shape

Pick an archetype before picking blocks — one decision here replaces half a dozen field-by-field questions.

| Archetype | Blocks, in order |
| --- | --- |
| **KPI overview** | one `bigNumber` metric-exploration per metric, then one `line` trend per metric |
| **Funnel / conversion** | `funnel-exploration` full width, then a `line` trend of the entry metric, then a breakdown of it by one dimension |
| **Single-metric deep dive** | `bigNumber`, `line` trend, one `bar` breakdown per dimension, optional `fact-table-exploration` table |
| **Experiment program review** | `experiments-status` + `experiments-win-rate`, then `metric-experiments` + `experiments-scaled-impact` |

Archetypes compose: "signup funnel plus how our tests are doing" is the funnel set followed by the experiment-program set, under one legend.

If the request clearly implies an archetype, pick it and say which one you picked. Only ask when two or more are genuinely plausible.

### 4. Find the metrics

Use `metric-search` if the user's metrics are not resolved yet, or list directly:

```bash
# The user named metrics: search every datasource, so one outside the default is still found.
gb-call GET '/api/v1/fact-metrics?limit=100'

# They named none: browse what the default can chart.
gb-call GET '/api/v1/fact-metrics?datasourceId=<ds_id>&limit=100'
```

Filtering by the step-1 pick before the metrics are resolved is how a requested metric goes missing. Each hit's own `datasource` becomes that chart's `config.datasource`; when a hit belongs to a source that cannot run explorations, say so rather than dropping it quietly.

Only fact metrics (`fact__...`) are chartable. Capture `id`, `metricType`, and `numerator.factTableId` for each, then fetch the fact table for its `userIdTypes`:

```bash
gb-call GET /api/v1/fact-tables/<factTableId>
```

### 5. Look up columns and values

Only when the dashboard needs a breakdown or a row filter. `columns[]` on the fact table gives the column names and datatypes; `topValues` on a string column is the only value lookup the API offers. Take every filter value from `topValues`. When the one you need is absent, ask the user or fall back to a `contains` filter, and say which you did.

### 6. Build the blocks

Every block needs `type`, `title`, and `description` (`""` is fine for the description, but always give a chart a real title — it is the tile's heading). Chart blocks add `config`. See **Block reference** below, and **Layout** for `layout`.

Add exactly one `markdown` block, first in the list, as the legend: one opening line on what the dashboard is for, then one line per chart saying what to read from it. That one covers the whole page — each chart labels itself through its own `title`.

### 7. Create the dashboard

One POST with the whole thing. Show the user the payload and get confirmation first — this creates something the whole organization may see.

```bash
echo '<dashboard-json>' | gb-call POST /api/v1/dashboards -
```

```json
{
  "title": "Growth KPIs",
  "editLevel": "private",
  "shareLevel": "private",
  "enableAutoUpdates": false,
  "projects": ["prj_abc123"],
  "globalControls": {
    "dateRange": { "predefined": "last30Days" },
    "dateGranularity": "auto"
  },
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "title": "About this dashboard",
      "description": "",
      "layout": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 24, "h": 3 },
      "content": "How revenue and signups are tracking over the last 30 days.\n\n- **Revenue** — total revenue in the period.\n- **Revenue over time** — daily revenue; watch for step changes."
    },
    {
      "type": "metric-exploration",
      "title": "Revenue",
      "description": "",
      "layout": { "x": 0, "y": 3, "w": 8, "h": 4 },
      "config": { "...": "a bigNumber metric config" }
    },
    {
      "type": "metric-exploration",
      "title": "Revenue over time",
      "description": "",
      "layout": { "x": 0, "y": 7, "w": 12, "h": 8 },
      "config": { "...": "a line metric config" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The response is `{ "dashboard": { "id": "dash_...", ... } }`. Report what is on the dashboard in a sentence, plus any assumption you made, and link it at `/product-analytics/dashboards/<id>`.

## Block reference

**Required top-level fields:** `title`, `editLevel`, `shareLevel`, `enableAutoUpdates`, `blocks`. `projects`, `globalControls`, and `comparison` are optional. Omit `experimentId` — a general dashboard has none, and setting it makes an experiment dashboard instead.

- `editLevel` — `"private"` (only you can edit) or `"published"` (members with permission can). Default to `"private"`.
- `shareLevel` — same two values, for viewing. Default to `"private"`; the user can publish it afterwards.
- `enableAutoUpdates` — `false` unless the user asks for a refresh schedule, which also needs `updateSchedule` (`{ "type": "stale", "hours": 24 }` or `{ "type": "cron", "cron": "0 6 * * *" }`).
- `globalControls` — the dashboard-wide filter bar: `dateRange`, `dateGranularity`, and for experimentation blocks `projects` and `experimentSearchString`. A chart block is enrolled in the date range automatically, and queried over it.
- `comparison` — dashboard-wide compare-to-previous-period, e.g. `{ "enabled": true, "mode": "previousPeriod" }`. Modes: `previousPeriod`, `previousPeriodMatchDayOfWeek`, `previousYear`, `previousYearMatchDayOfWeek`, `custom`.

### Chart blocks

`metric-exploration`, `fact-table-exploration`, `data-source-exploration`, and `funnel-exploration` each carry a `config` — the same exploration config `analytics-explore` posts, with the same rules for `unit`, dimensions, chart types, and date ranges. Read that workflow for the config shape.

**Omit `explorerAnalysisId`.** The create call runs each `config` and fills it in. Sending one binds the tile to a run you made yourself, which is only worth doing when you already have it.

`config.type` is the **dataset kind** — `metric`, `fact_table`, `data_source`, or `funnel` — and it must match `dataset.type`. The picture is `chartType`, a separate field: `line`, `area`, `bar`, `stackedBar`, `horizontalBar`, `stackedHorizontalBar`, `table`, `timeseries-table`, `bigNumber`. A chart type is never a `config.type`.

`datasource`, `dimensions`, `chartType`, `dateRange`, `type`, and `dataset` are all required. `dimensions: []` when the tile has no breakdown — leaving it out fails the write.

**`dimensions` takes one of exactly two shapes**, copied literally:

| What the tile does | The dimension to send |
| --- | --- |
| Trend over time | `{ "dimensionType": "date", "column": null, "dateGranularity": "auto" }` |
| Break down by a column | `{ "dimensionType": "dynamic", "column": "browser", "maxValues": 5 }` |
| Neither (single total) | `[]` |

`dimensionType` is the **kind** of dimension, never the thing you are grouping by: `"dimension"`, `"browser"`, `"user"` and `"column"` are all rejected, and `"dimension"` is the guess the API sees most. `maxValues` is required on `dynamic` (1–20) and meaningless on `date`; `dateGranularity` is required on `date` and meaningless on `dynamic`. The validator also accepts `static` and `slice` — internal UI surface, don't emit them.

A `metric-exploration` config, the one most tiles use:

```json
{
  "type": "metric",
  "datasource": "ds_abc123",
  "chartType": "line",
  "dateRange": { "predefined": "last30Days" },
  "dimensions": [{ "dimensionType": "date", "column": null, "dateGranularity": "auto" }],
  "dataset": {
    "type": "metric",
    "values": [
      { "type": "metric", "name": "Revenue per User", "metricId": "fact__abc", "unit": "user_id", "denominatorUnit": null, "rowFilters": [] }
    ]
  }
}
```

The same tile broken down by browser rather than over time is that config with `"chartType": "bar"` and:

```json
"dimensions": [{ "dimensionType": "dynamic", "column": "browser", "maxValues": 5 }]
```

A big-number tile is that same config with `"chartType": "bigNumber"` and `"dimensions": []`. There is no `metric` shorthand — one metric is a `dataset.values` array of length one, and several big numbers on one tile are several entries in it.

A `funnel-exploration` config uses the funnel dataset:

```json
{
  "type": "funnel",
  "datasource": "ds_abc123",
  "chartType": "bar",
  "dateRange": { "predefined": "last30Days" },
  "dimensions": [],
  "dataset": {
    "type": "funnel",
    "unit": "user_id",
    "steps": [
      { "name": "Viewed pricing", "factTableId": "ftb_abc", "rowFilters": [], "optional": false },
      { "name": "Started signup", "factTableId": "ftb_abc", "rowFilters": [], "optional": false }
    ],
    "yAxisScale": "percent"
  }
}
```

`unit` must exist on every step's fact table. `optional` is required per step. At most 10 steps.

### Experimentation blocks

These compute from experiment data and take no `config`.

| Type | Required fields |
| --- | --- |
| `experiments-status` | `dateRange`, `projects` |
| `experiments-win-rate` | `dateRange`, `projects`, `showProjectBreakdown` |
| `experiments-scaled-impact` | `dateRange`, `projects`, `metricId` |
| `metric-experiments` | `metricId`, `projects`, `experimentSearchString`, `differenceType`, `bandits` |

`projects: []` means every project. `experimentSearchString: ""` means no filter. `differenceType` is `absolute`, `relative`, or `scaled`. `dateRange` takes the same shape as an exploration's.

### Other blocks

- `markdown` — `content`. The legend, and nothing else.
- `sql-explorer` — `savedQueryId` and `blockConfig` (an array of visualization ids; `[]` is valid). Only for a saved query that already exists.

### Blocks that do not belong here

The per-experiment result blocks — `experiment-metric`, `experiment-dimension`, `experiment-time-series`, `experiment-metadata`, `experiment-traffic` — read from one experiment's snapshot and belong on that experiment's own dashboard. The API accepts them on a general dashboard, where they render nothing. If the user wants one experiment's results, say they live on the experiment's page and offer the **experiments** skill (`experiment-analyze` workflow).

`metric-explorer` is deprecated. Use `metric-exploration`.

## Layout

The grid is 24 columns wide. Each block takes `layout: { x, y, w, h }` — `x` and `w` in columns, `y` and `h` in rows. Omit it and the block is stacked full width beneath everything before it, which is a safe but dull default.

| Intent | `w` | `h` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KPI tile (`bigNumber`) | 8 | 4 |
| Paired chart | 12 | 8 |
| Full-width chart, table, or funnel | 24 | 8 |
| The legend `markdown` | 24 | 3 |

To place them: walk the blocks in reading order, filling a row left to right while the widths still fit in 24, then start a new row. `x` is the running total of widths in the current row; `y` is the running total of the heights of the rows above; a row is as tall as its tallest block.

Three KPI tiles then a full-width chart:

```json
[
  { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 8, "h": 4 },
  { "x": 8, "y": 0, "w": 8, "h": 4 },
  { "x": 16, "y": 0, "w": 8, "h": 4 },
  { "x": 0, "y": 4, "w": 24, "h": 8 }
]
```

Minimum widths are enforced when the user drags a tile, so a narrower `w` snaps wider on first touch: keep `w` at 8 or more for a chart or markdown block, and 12 or more for `metric-experiments` and `experiments-scaled-impact`.

The user can rearrange the grid on the dashboard itself, so aim for a sensible default rather than a perfect one.

## Ask budget

The name and the project have no default. Ask for both in one question, then **at most one more**, bundling any remaining gaps into it.

| Slot | Default | Ask only when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | none | always, unless the user already named it |
| Project | none | the org has 2+ projects and the user named none |
| Datasource | the only one | 2+ exist and none is named |
| Archetype | inferred from wording | 2+ genuinely plausible |
| Metrics | search hits | 0 hits, or one named metric matches 2+ results |
| Timeframe | `{ "predefined": "last30Days" }` | the user is vague about a period |
| Granularity | `"auto"` | never |
| Breakdown | none | the user said "by X" and X maps to 2+ columns |
| Comparison | off | the user implies one but the mode is unclear |
| Share and edit level | `"private"` | never |
| Auto-updates | `false` | never |

Ask only where the answer changes a block. Everywhere else, build something reasonable and state the assumption you made.

## Guardrails

- **One POST per dashboard.** Every block goes in the create call; the server runs each chart. Do not POST explorations first, and do not create the dashboard and then add tiles to it.
- **Say what the dashboard will contain, then get a yes.** A dashboard is organization-visible configuration, and the payload is unreadable at a glance. Lead with the name and where it lands, then one bullet per tile — chart type, metric, timeframe — in the words the user would use. Someone who never opens the JSON should be able to tell you got it wrong.
- **`explorerAnalysisId` is the server's to fill.** Omit it on every chart block you have not run yourself.
- **A chart that cannot run fails the whole create.** The dashboard is not created, and the error names the block and the field, so there is no partial dashboard to clean up. Change what the message names and call again once; a payload that repeats a rejected field fails identically. If you cannot tell from the message what a valid value is, stop and ask rather than resending — a dashboard is many blocks, and guessing one field at a time burns a real query per attempt.
- **One datasource per chart.** Every metric in a chart's `values[]`, every fact table, and every raw table must belong to that chart's own `config.datasource`, or the run fails. Different tiles may use different ones.
- **Always set `unit` explicitly** on each `dataset.values[]` entry, never on the config, which rejects it: `userIdTypes[0]` for `mean`, `proportion`, `retention`, and `dailyParticipation`; `null` for `ratio` and `quantile`. A missing unit is not backfilled — it silently switches to event-level aggregation.
- **A date range's `predefined` comes from the closed list in the router's shared conventions.** Anything outside it is `customLookback` with `lookbackValue` and `lookbackUnit` (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`) — six months is `{ "predefined": "customLookback", "lookbackValue": 6, "lookbackUnit": "month" }`. This holds for `globalControls.dateRange` and each block's `config.dateRange`.
- **One legend, and only on a new dashboard.** Exactly one `markdown` block, first. No section headings, no per-group captions.
- **Charts cost money and time.** Every chart block runs a real warehouse query on create. A twelve-tile dashboard is twelve queries — build what the user asked for, not a speculative superset.

## Endpoints used

- `GET /api/v1/data-sources` — pick the datasource
- `GET /api/v1/projects` — settle which project the dashboard belongs to
- `GET /api/v1/fact-metrics` — find chartable metrics
- `GET /api/v1/fact-tables` and `GET /api/v1/fact-tables/:id` — fact tables, columns, `userIdTypes`, `topValues`
- `POST /api/v1/dashboards` — create the dashboard

## Handoffs

- `references/dashboard-edit.md` — to change a dashboard that already exists
- `references/analytics-explore.md` — for the exploration config shape, and when the user only wanted one chart
- `references/metric-search.md` — to resolve which metrics exist before building
- the **experiments** skill (`experiment-analyze` workflow) — for one experiment's results
