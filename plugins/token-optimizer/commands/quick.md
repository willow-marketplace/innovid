# Quick Context Check

Fast health check. Show the user where they stand in under 10 lines.

## Steps

1. Resolve measure.py path:
```bash
RUNTIME="${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME:-}"
if [ -z "$RUNTIME" ]; then
  if [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA" ]; then
    RUNTIME="claude"
  elif [ -n "$CODEX_HOME" ] || [ -d "$HOME/.codex" ]; then
    RUNTIME="codex"
  else
    RUNTIME="claude"
  fi
fi
MEASURE_PY=""
for f in "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache"/*/token-optimizer/*/skills/token-optimizer/scripts/measure.py \
         "$HOME/.codex/skills/token-optimizer/scripts/measure.py" \
         "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache"/*/token-optimizer/*/skills/token-optimizer/scripts/measure.py \
         "$HOME/.claude/skills/token-optimizer/scripts/measure.py" \
         "$HOME/.claude/token-optimizer/skills/token-optimizer/scripts/measure.py"; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && MEASURE_PY="$f" && break
done
export TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME="$RUNTIME"
```

2. Run:
   - Claude Code plugin: `bash "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/python-launcher.sh" $MEASURE_PY quick --json`
   - Codex or standalone: `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=codex python3 "$MEASURE_PY" quick --json`

3. Parse the JSON output and present concisely:
   - Context overhead: X tokens (Y% of context window)
   - Quality score: N/100 (letter grade)
   - Top 3 offenders with estimated savings (if any)
   - Degradation risk (from the MRCR curve data)

4. Keep the response under 10 lines. This is a quick pulse check, not a full audit.

5. Based on quality score, suggest next action:
   - Score 85+: "Context is clean. No action needed."
   - Score 70-84: "Context is good but has some bloat. Consider `/compact` if you've been going a while."
   - Score 50-69: "Context quality is degraded. Run `/compact` to reclaim quality, or `/token-optimizer` for a full audit."
   - Score below 50: "Context quality is critical. Consider `/clear` with checkpoint, or run `/token-optimizer` for a full audit."
