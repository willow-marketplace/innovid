# Fleet Auditor: Cross-Platform Agent Token Waste Auditor

Detects installed agent systems, collects token usage data, identifies waste patterns, and recommends fixes with dollar savings estimates. Everyone tracks. Nobody coaches. Until now.

**Use when**: Running multiple agent systems, spending $2-5/day on agents, suspecting idle heartbeats are burning tokens, or want a cross-system cost audit.

---

## Phase 0: Initialize

1. **Resolve runtime and fleet.py path** (works for both skill and plugin installs):
```bash
RUNTIME="${TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME:-}"
if [ -z "$RUNTIME" ]; then
  if [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] || [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA" ]; then
    RUNTIME="claude"
  elif [ -n "$CODEX_HOME" ] || [ -d "$HOME/.codex" ]; then
    RUNTIME="codex"
  else
    RUNTIME="claude"
  fi
fi

FLEET_PY=""
for f in "$HOME/.codex/skills/fleet-auditor/scripts/fleet.py" \
         "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache"/*/token-optimizer/*/skills/fleet-auditor/scripts/fleet.py \
         "$HOME/.claude/skills/fleet-auditor/scripts/fleet.py" \
         "$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache"/*/token-optimizer/*/skills/fleet-auditor/scripts/fleet.py; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && FLEET_PY="$f" && break
done
[ -z "$FLEET_PY" ] && { echo "[Error] fleet.py not found. Is Fleet Auditor installed?"; exit 1; }
echo "Using: $FLEET_PY"
export TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME="$RUNTIME"
```
Use `$FLEET_PY` for all subsequent fleet.py calls.

2. **Detect systems**:
```bash
python3 "$FLEET_PY" detect --json
```
Parse the JSON output. Report what was found.

If nothing detected, explain: "No agent systems found. Fleet Auditor supports: Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, NanoClaw, Hermes, OpenCode, IronClaw."

---

## Phase 1: Scan

Collect token usage data from detected systems:
```bash
python3 "$FLEET_PY" scan --days 30
```

Report how many runs were collected per system. If this is the first scan, it may take a moment to parse all session files.

---

## Phase 2: Audit

Run waste pattern detection:
```bash
python3 "$FLEET_PY" audit --json
```

Parse the JSON output. Present findings ordered by severity and monthly savings.

If no waste found: "Your fleet looks clean. No significant waste patterns detected."

For Codex findings, be careful with dollars: if a model's pricing is not in the local pricing table, present token waste confidently and say dollar impact depends on current model pricing instead of inventing a cost.

**OpenClaw Security + Cost Check** (March 2026):
- If OpenClaw is detected and version < 2026.3.12: flag as HIGH severity. 31 CVEs including ClawJacked (full agent takeover). Compromised instances run rogue agents that burn tokens undetected. Recommend immediate upgrade.
- Check for ClawHub skills matching ClawHavoc campaign patterns (1,184+ malicious skills). These skills exfiltrate data via extra API calls, inflating token spend.
- Flag if gateway rate limiting is disabled (CVE-2026-25253). Without it, brute-force attacks can spawn unlimited agent sessions. Recommend: `openclaw config set security.rateLimit.enabled true`

---

## Phase 3: Present Findings

```
[Fleet Auditor Results]

SYSTEMS DETECTED
- Claude Code: X runs ($Y.YY)
- Codex: X runs ($Y.YY)
- OpenClaw: X runs ($Y.YY)

WASTE PATTERNS FOUND
1. [SEVERITY] Description
   Est. savings: $X.XX/month
   Fix: recommendation

2. [SEVERITY] Description
   ...

TOTAL POTENTIAL SAVINGS: $X.XX/month

Ready to act? I can:
1. Show detailed fix snippets for each finding
2. Generate the fleet dashboard for visual analysis
3. Run /token-optimizer for deeper Claude Code optimization
```

---

## Phase 4: Dashboard (optional)

If user wants visual analysis:
```bash
python3 "$FLEET_PY" dashboard
```

This generates `~/.claude/_backups/token-optimizer/fleet-dashboard.html` in Claude Code, or `~/.codex/_backups/token-optimizer/fleet-dashboard.html` when `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME=codex`.

---

## Phase 5: Deep Dive (optional)

For Claude Code specifically, offer `/token-optimizer` for full audit (`CLAUDE.md`, skills, MCP, hooks, etc.).

For Codex specifically, offer `token-optimizer` for full audit (`AGENTS.md`, Codex memories, plugin skills, MCP, balanced hooks, compact prompt, status line).

For other systems, show the fix snippets from the audit and guide the user through implementing them.

## Reference Files

| Phase | Read |
|-------|------|
| Adapter development | `references/fleet-systems.md` |
| Detector development | `references/waste-patterns.md` |

---

## Error Handling

- **No systems detected**: Report cleanly, list supported systems
- **Empty scan results**: System detected but no session data in window. Suggest increasing `--days`
- **Permission errors**: Report which files couldn't be read, continue with available data
- **Corrupted data**: Skip bad files, report count of skipped files
- **fleet.py not found**: Check both skill and plugin install paths

---

## Core Rules

- Quantify everything in dollars AND tokens
- Never read or expose message content (privacy-first)
- Report confidence levels alongside findings
- Suppress findings below 0.4 confidence threshold
- Always show fix snippets with recommendations
- Frame savings as monthly recurring, not one-time
