# Sales operations and CRM workflows

Set up and run sales operations workflows in Airtable — pipeline, accounts, renewals, deal desk, RFP tracking, partner CRMs, vertical sales-shaped systems. Adapts to team size, existing CRM, and industry. Ask scope before scaffolding; the same trigger can mean a 3-table pipeline for a 5-person team, a Salesforce-augmenting deal desk for a 200-person enterprise sales org, or a vertical-specific CRM for a mortgage broker / real estate firm / public-works contractor.

## Who this serves and what they're solving for

Sales operations spans more roles and verticals than the "VP Sales running Salesforce" stereotype.

-   **Revenue leaders** (CRO / VP Sales / RevOps / sales-ops manager) — pipeline coverage, forecast accuracy, segment visibility, lead-to-revenue efficiency. _"Broken"_ means _"I can't trust the numbers."_
-   **Daily operators** (AE / SDR / BDR / account manager) — prospect context at the point of contact, fast inbound routing, deal-stage clarity, low-friction logging. _"Broken"_ means _"I'm pasting between five tabs to send one email."_
-   **Cross-functional support** (deal desk, sales engineering, sales-ops analysts) — approval routing with audit trail, capacity vs. demand, technical-fit scoring, exception triage. Distinct product surface from the CRM itself.
-   **Partner / channel managers** — partner-led pipeline rollups, deal registration with anti-conflict rules, joint account planning, MDF tracking.
-   **Vertical operators** — mortgage loan officers, real-estate brokers, capture managers (public works / AEC), donor relations leads, capital-markets desk operators — sales-shaped workflows with industry-specific vocabulary, regulators, and integrations.

Cross-cutting problems: the existing CRM is usually staying but bleeds into spreadsheets where work actually happens (_"swivel-chair work,"_ _"single source of truth"_); per-seat licensing pushes stakeholders out of the system, so visibility breaks; the modern sales-tech stack (Outreach / Salesloft / Apollo / Gong / CaptivateIQ) is often _absent_ in non-tech and mid-market footprints; AI-forward teams want an open data substrate to build Clay-equivalent enrichment + AI-drafted outbound + conversation-intel ingestion _on_, not a CRM with AI bolted on.

## Before scaffolding: ask scope

Sales operations spans more industries and shapes than most categories — most customers running sales workflows in Airtable are NOT tech-SaaS GTM teams. Real estate brokerages, mortgage operations, insurance carriers, capital markets desks, public-works contractors, nonprofits managing donors, education institutions managing partnerships, talent agencies tracking deals — all run "sales ops in Airtable" with different schemas and workflows. Lead with three scope questions; branch from there.

1. **Team size and shape.** Solo / small (under 10) / mid (10–50) / large (50+) / enterprise (multi-team / multi-base). Determines schema-shape default — a 5-person team building their first CRM and a 200-person sales org augmenting Salesforce don't want the same scaffolding.
2. **Existing CRM (or deliberate absence of one).** _"Do you have a CRM today (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, smaller / vertical CRM, none yet, 'Salesforce that everyone hates', or are you building an AI-native stack without a traditional CRM)?"_ Single most load-bearing question for this skill. Pulls the augment-vs-replace-vs-build-from-scratch decision into the open. **Frame the consolidation value-prop and let the user choose**: full migration (Airtable replaces the CRM — common at smaller scale or non-tech verticals), augmentation (Airtable as agile UI / staging / pre-CRM / post-CRM layer above the CRM as system of record — dominant at scale), license-reduction (Airtable as read-mostly UI for stakeholders who can't justify CRM seats), lightweight CRM for a sub-team while the main CRM stays as SoR, or **AI-native lean stack** (Airtable as the data substrate for AI-forward startups that may never adopt a traditional CRM — Clay-style enrichment + AI account briefs + AI-assisted outbound layered on Airtable's typed records, AI Field Agents, and REST API). All five are valid; don't push any single shape as a directive. See `references/integrations.md` for per-CRM and AI-stack integration mechanics.
3. **Primary sub-workflow.** _"Pipeline management, account management, renewal motion, deal desk, RFP / tender pipeline, partner / channel CRM, or vertical-specific (mortgage, real estate, brokerage, etc.)?"_ Determines which Work-mode playbook and which schema shape to lead with. Most users want one of these first, not all of them.

Branch into these when relevant — only when relevant:

-   **Industry / vertical signal.** When the user's language signals it (_"broker"_, _"tender"_, _"loan"_, _"underwriting"_, _"property"_, _"donor"_), confirm the vertical and load the vertical schema. Vertical schemas don't generalize cleanly across industries — a mortgage CRM and a public-works tender pipeline share almost nothing operationally.
-   **License-reduction motive** when the user has Salesforce + a small team (under 20 reps) or a budget-constrained scenario. Surfaces the "Airtable as read-mostly UI layer above SFDC" pattern instead of full replacement.
-   **AI vendor constraints** — when AI workflows surface, ask about approved-vendor LLM constraints (Gemini-only, no third-party LLMs). Real pattern in regulated enterprises.
-   **External-facing surface needed?** _"Branded partner / vendor / contractor portal? Public partner registration? Embedded inside an existing product? Slack / WhatsApp / Teams bot?"_ Two viable paths — surface both and let the user choose. **Airtable Portals** is the first-party branded external-collaborator surface (Interface-based with custom sign-in / logo / background; paid add-on starting at Team-tier pricing per portal seat) — fastest to set up, fits when Interface Designer's component set covers the workflow. **Custom UI on Vercel / etc.** is the right call when the user wants full design control, has budget concerns about the Portal add-on, needs UX beyond Interface Designer's component set, needs server-side compute, wants to embed inside an existing product, or wants a chat-driven channel. Both are legitimate; the user's call.

Three lead questions usually clarify the scaffold in one round. Don't impose a framework before listening.

## Two modes

### Setup mode: scaffold a base

When the user asks _"set up a CRM"_ / _"build me a sales pipeline"_ / _"track deals"_ / _"build a partner registration system"_, scaffold the schema via the MCP after scope is clear.

1. **Scope questions** (above). Read the answers. A 5-minute scope conversation beats a wrong-shape rebuild — especially across the industry diversity this category covers.
2. **Pick a schema shape** matching team size, CRM presence, and vertical. Five lead shapes the skill body names inline; vertical and specialized shapes available on demand via `references/vertical-shapes.md` and `references/schema-shapes.md`.
3. **Build the schema via MCP** — base, typed fields, linked records, formulas, rollups, sample / seed data. The schema is the foundation everything else builds on. Spend the agent's effort on richer typed fields, status `singleSelect`s with thoughtful stage colors, linked-record relationships with rollup counts (e.g., `Opportunities.Amount × Probability` rolled up to Account-level expected revenue).
4. **Hand off UI configuration** — views (Kanban on Opportunities by Stage, calendar on next-action dates, gallery on Accounts), Interface pages, Automations, Forms, sync wizards (Salesforce / HubSpot / Slack / Jira). See "Build-plan output" below.
5. **Build any external-facing surfaces the user wants** — for partner / vendor / contractor / client portals, mention that Airtable Portals (paid add-on, Interface-based, branded sign-in) is one option, and a custom Vercel app reading Airtable via REST API is another. Build whichever the user chooses; don't prescribe. Same for chat-driven workflows (Slack / WhatsApp / Teams bots), embedded surfaces inside existing products, or other custom UI — the user knows what fits their situation. See `references/build-shapes.md` for the patterns.

#### Lead schema shapes

The five most-common shapes — covering the great majority of invocations. Full field-by-field detail in `references/schema-shapes.md`.

-   **Lightweight pipeline (1–2 tables)** — Pipeline + Contacts. For solo founders, 2–3 person sales teams, deal trackers without dedicated SDR/AE function. Don't impose multi-table CRM structure they won't use. Customer language: _"I just need to track deals"_, _"a list of who I've talked to"_.
-   **Solo / small (3 tables)** — Accounts + Contacts + Opportunities. Classic CRM triangle. The default when the user wants a CRM without an existing one to augment. Add stage progression, probability, expected close, owner, lead source. Light AI integration (LinkedIn enrichment, AI-generated meeting prep) optional.
-   **Mid (5–6 tables)** — + Activities (calls / meetings / emails), + separate Leads table if inbound volume warrants it, + Stage configuration table. For 10–50 person teams running their own CRM end-to-end. Add forecast rollups (probability-weighted expected value by quarter), lead scoring, round-robin lead routing.
-   **CRM-augmentation (alongside Salesforce / HubSpot)** — synced Accounts / Contacts / Opportunities (read-only from the CRM) + native Airtable tables for what the CRM doesn't model well: Deal Desk requests, Customer Reference DB, Capacity / Quota tracking, Sales Engineering allocation, Activity / Meeting Note sync. **Most common shape at 50+ person sales orgs.** Includes the bi-directional sync pattern via Automations when push-back to the CRM is needed.
-   **Enterprise multi-base augmentation** — multi-base hub-and-spoke; central hub federating per-region or per-program spokes; bi-directional sync via Automations; row-level permissions via Interfaces so reps see only their accounts while managers roll up. For multi-region or multi-program sales orgs where each unit needs autonomy AND executive rollup is required.
-   **AI-native lean stack** (no traditional CRM, by design) — Accounts + Contacts + Opportunities + Activities + an AI-heavy Enrichment table where AI Field Agents waterfall-enrich records from LinkedIn, web research, and external enrichment APIs (the Clay-equivalent pattern, native in Airtable). Add AI-drafted outbound (drafts to a review queue, never autonomous send), AI account-brief generation, AI MEDDIC field extraction from synced transcripts. For AI-forward startups choosing Airtable + AI tooling over Salesforce + add-ons. Full detail in `references/schema-shapes.md#ai-native-lean-stack`.

**Vertical and specialized shapes** — surface only when scope answers indicate them (full detail in `references/vertical-shapes.md` and `references/schema-shapes.md`):

-   Brokerage / commission CRM (real estate, talent, mortgage broker, financial advisor) — industry-specific pricing / contract / commission calculation
-   Real estate CRM (residential / commercial; pursuit stages, MSA, acreage formulas)
-   Mortgage operations CRM (customer → cases → plans, 6-month renewal triggers, LOS sync)
-   Capital markets / investment banking (block trade lifecycle, sponsor coverage)
-   Public works / AEC tender pipeline (pursuit tiering, go/no-go, stakeholder intelligence)
-   Nonprofit / fundraising / donor pipeline
-   Partner / channel CRM with external collaborator access
-   Deal desk / approval workflow / pricing-calculator hub (distinct product surface from CRM)
-   Customer reference / advocacy database
-   Sales engineering activity & capacity tracking
-   Sales bookings forecast with rep-level row permissions
-   RFP / tender pipeline with pre-bid intelligence

Don't impose a 7-table CRM on a 3-person team; don't ship a 3-table starter to an enterprise org with 5 sales squads and an existing Salesforce. Pick the shape that matches the answers.

**Emerging pattern worth surfacing on request**: mutual action plans (MAPs) / deal rooms / evaluation rooms — high customer demand, low shipped reality. Can be scaffolded as a sub-workflow on top of the opportunity table, but flag as emerging rather than treating as default.

#### Build-layer decision

Setup-mode skills can compose across four parallel layers (not a waterfall):

1. **Schema layer (always via MCP)** — base, typed fields, linked records, formulas, seed data. The foundation; every path goes through it.
2. **Native Airtable UX** — views, Interface Designer pages, Automations, Forms, granular permissions, sync setup wizards. Use MCP for what it supports today; hand off via `[click here]` for what it doesn't yet.
3. **Airtable Portals** — Airtable's first-party branded external-collaborator surface, built on Interface Designer with custom sign-in page (logo + background), one portal per base, guest user access at Read-only / Commenter / Editor permission levels. **Paid add-on** (Team and Business tiers; Enterprise feature). Suits cases where the user wants a fast branded sign-in for external collaborators and Interface Designer's component set covers the workflow.
4. **Custom app layer (REST API + agent-built UI)** — Next.js / React app on Vercel, Slack / WhatsApp / Discord / Teams bot, scheduled scripts, embedded surfaces inside the user's existing product. Suits cases where the user wants full design control, embedded surfaces in an existing product, chat-driven channels, server-side compute, or UX beyond Interface Designer's component set.

**For external-facing surfaces, surface both Portals and custom-Vercel paths and let the user choose.** Neither is a default — both are legitimate. Portals saves build time when its component set fits and the add-on cost works; custom Vercel gives full design control and avoids the add-on if the user has bandwidth to build and host. The user knows their constraints (budget, design needs, engineering capacity, time-to-ship) better than the skill does.

Lean toward native Airtable when the user says _"I want to track deals"_ / _"manage accounts"_ without specifying any external-facing surface. When external collaborators come up, mention both Portals and custom-app as options and follow the user's lead.

See `references/build-shapes.md` for concrete patterns under both paths.

### Work mode: operate on an existing base

When the user invokes the skill against a base that already exists — _"triage this week's leads"_, _"prep the QBR forecast"_, _"flag at-risk renewals"_, _"score these inbound RFPs"_ — identify which sub-workflow they want, execute via MCP (filtering, scoring, updating, rolling up), then hand off the result via `show-airtable-link`.

#### Lead sub-workflows

Twelve sub-workflow shapes that cover most invocations. Each has a full playbook in `references/sub-workflows.md` — load the relevant section on demand.

1. **Pipeline triage and stage progression** — filter opportunities by stage, qualification field, age, owner; identify stalled deals; update stage / next-step / probability. The most common Work-mode invocation.
2. **Lead routing and assignment** — score / classify inbound leads; route to AE / SDR via round-robin or rule-based assignment; notify Slack. Sub-minute pickup achievable when the automation chain is tight.
3. **Forecast review** — roll up `Amount × Probability` by quarter / owner / segment / vertical; identify forecast risk; export to BI. Pipeline coverage and forecast accuracy as core metrics.
4. **Account research and account-brief generation** — gather context across Accounts / Opportunities / Activities / external sources (LinkedIn, news, web research); produce meeting-prep brief. AI-assisted where access permits.
5. **Renewal pipeline / risk monitoring** — identify accounts approaching renewal; rollup usage / engagement signals; flag at-risk; trigger CSM action. Distinct from raw pipeline; this is the commercial side of post-sale.
6. **Sales-to-service handoff** — validate Closed-Won opportunities meet required-field thresholds (PO, amount, ship date, terms); create downstream records in ops / install / project tables; notify handoff team. Pipeline doesn't end at "Closed-Won."
7. **Deal desk review** — triage Deal Support Requests / pricing exceptions / partner exception requests; route to approvers; track approval state with SOX auditability; tie back to opportunity.
8. **Partner / channel CRM ops** — partner pipeline review, channel registration, joint account planning, partner-led pipeline rollup, deal registration approvals. External-collaborator interfaces where partners log into Airtable to update their own records.
9. **RFP / tender pipeline ops** — pre-bid intel triage, go/no-go decision tracking, bid submission status, win-rate analysis by tier, capture vs. pursuit framing for AEC / public-works / enterprise B2B.
10. **Customer reference / advocacy DB ops** — match customer asks to available references, check rights / permissions / clauses sourced from contracts, log usage to track over-asking risk.
11. **Data enrichment waterfall (Clay-equivalent)** — multi-source AI enrichment per record (LinkedIn → web research → external data providers → AI Field Agents extracting structured fields from unstructured sources). Per-record waterfall logic: try primary source; if missing, try secondary; backfill via web research as fallback. Native pattern in Airtable; no separate Clay subscription required for most teams.
12. **AI-assisted outbound drafts (copilot pattern, not autonomous)** — generate per-recipient outbound drafts (email, LinkedIn, multi-channel sequence) using AI Field Agents with account + contact context. Drafts land in a review queue; a human approves before send. Critical: this is the validated shape — fully autonomous AI SDR tools have churned heavily in the market, while the copilot pattern (AI drafts → human review) sticks.

Plus one opt-in pattern worth surfacing when the user is explicitly building an agent-driven workflow:

13. **Agent activity log pattern** — when the user describes an agent-driven workflow (recurring triage, multi-step plan, automated monitoring), surface the opt-in `Agent activity log` pattern and compose the `agent-activity-log` skill to scaffold + operate it. Don't re-implement the schema inline.

A longer tail of reference-available Work-mode sub-workflows lives in `references/sub-workflows.md` — vertical-specific (mortgage renewal close, brokerage commission close), specialized (sales engineering capacity rollup, sales bookings forecast snapshot, whitespace mapping, quarterly sales planning), emerging patterns (Mutual Action Plans / deal rooms), and additional AI copilot patterns (AI MEDDIC extraction → human verification, AI inbound classifier with auto-routing, AI account-brief from web research). Load when scope surfaces them.

## Composition

This skill composes with three siblings; don't reinvent what they own.

-   **`show-airtable-link`** — every Setup-mode build-plan ends with a base link; every Work-mode operation that touches records ends with a record / table / page link. Mandatory composition. Hand off the most-specific URL the tool calls have proven access to.
-   **`airtable-filters`** — when Work-mode operations slice records (triage queues, _"find Enterprise accounts with no activity in 30 days"_, capacity rollups), compose the filter syntax through this skill rather than re-deriving it.
-   **`airtable-overview`** — load only when the user shows confusion about basic data-model concepts (base / table / record / interface page). Most users don't need it; pulling it in by default wastes tokens.

## Permission-aware behavior

The MCP user's auth determines which URLs the user can actually open. Respect the scope the tool calls have proven:

-   **Page-restricted users** (interface-only access via Airtable's permission model) — hand off interface page URLs only. A `tbl_*` URL the user can't open is a dead link from their perspective.
-   **Table-level access** — table URLs are safe.
-   **Workspace-level access** — workspace URLs are safe.

Standing rule: if a tool call didn't prove the access surface, don't link to it. When in doubt, drop one specificity level. The `show-airtable-link` skill enforces this when handing off URLs.

## Build-plan output

Four output shapes, depending on which layers apply. Pick what matches what the user actually asked for — don't over-build (no custom partner portal for _"track my deals"_) and don't under-build (no UI-step list when they asked for _"a branded partner registration page"_).

**Before listing items in any `Configure in Airtable` or `Configure Portal` block below, check the live MCP at `mcp.airtable.com/mcp` for current support — if the MCP now authors a surface you'd otherwise hand off (view, Interface page, Automation, Form, etc.), use the MCP path instead. The MCP's capability boundary is moving fast; what's a UI handoff today may be MCP-driven tomorrow.**

**Pure Airtable** (most common — user wants the native experience):

```
✅ Built (via MCP):
  - [Base name] with [N] tables, [N] fields, linked records, [N] seed records
  - View in Airtable: [base link]

🎨 Configure in Airtable:
  - [Specific Kanban / calendar / gallery view, e.g. "Kanban on Opportunities grouped by Stage"] — [click here]
  - [Specific Interface page for the right stakeholder audience, e.g. "Forecast dashboard for sales leadership"] — [click here]
  - [Specific form / automation, e.g. "Form for inbound lead intake" or "Round-robin lead assignment automation"] — [click here]
```

**Airtable + Portal** (when the user has chosen this path):

```
✅ Built (via MCP):
  - [Base + schema]
  - View in Airtable: [base link]

🌐 Configure Airtable Portal:
  - Enable Portal on the [base] — [click here]
  - Branded sign-in page (logo + background — Business/Enterprise) — [click here]
  - Share the [partner-facing Interface] to portal guests at [permission level] — [click here]

🎨 Configure in Airtable:
  - [Admin Interface page for sales-team triage of incoming portal activity] — [click here]
  - [Automation, e.g. "Slack notification when portal guest submits a form"] — [click here]
```

**Airtable + custom Vercel app** (when the user has chosen this path):

```
✅ Built (via MCP):
  - [Base + schema]
  - View in Airtable: [base link]

🛠️ Custom app:
  - [Next.js app at vercel-deploy-url]
  - Reads / writes [tables] via Airtable REST API
  - PAT scoped to [scopes]
  - Source: [github-repo-link]

🎨 Configure in Airtable:
  - [Admin interface page for sales-team triage] — [click here]
  - [Automation tying app to base events] — [click here]
```

**Airtable augmenting Salesforce / HubSpot** (the dominant pattern at scale):

```
✅ Built (via MCP):
  - [Base name] with [N] tables for what the CRM doesn't model — Deal Desk, Reference DB, etc.
  - Synced from [Salesforce/HubSpot]: Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities (read-only via native sync)
  - View in Airtable: [base link]

🔄 Configure CRM sync (see references/integrations.md for current mechanics):
  - Native sync from [Salesforce/HubSpot] — [setup wizard]
  - Write-back path (Salesforce Automation Actions for SFDC; REST API for HubSpot) for [specific writeback fields]

🎨 Configure in Airtable:
  - [Specific Interface page for Deal Desk / sales-team triage] — [click here]
  - [Automation for stage-change push-back to the CRM] — [click here]
```

Pick the 1–3 most-impactful UI handoffs; don't enumerate every possible view. Look up current sync limits, plan-tier gating, and supported objects at execution time — see `references/integrations.md` for the per-tool framework (native sync, Automation Actions, HyperDB sync for very large datasets, REST API, MCP).

## Anti-patterns (what NOT to default to)

These are the recurring failure modes — defaulting to assumptions the data doesn't support.

-   **Don't default to a tech-SaaS GTM frame.** Industry diversity dominates this category. Real estate, mortgage, insurance, capital markets, healthcare-adjacent, public sector, nonprofit, education, talent / media run sales operations in Airtable. The "default sales-ops customer" is an SMB- or mid-market non-tech customer, not a tech startup with a Salesloft+Gong+Outreach stack. Probe broadly before assuming.
-   **Don't assume the user wants to replace Salesforce.** Most Salesforce mentions in deployed setups are augmentation, not replacement. Default to augmentation when a CRM is named. Replacement is a real path for small/mid customers and specific industries, but ask first.
-   **Don't assume the modern sales tech stack is in place — but don't dismiss it either.** The dominant Airtable sales-ops customer doesn't have Outreach / Salesloft / Apollo / Gong / 6sense / Demandbase / CaptivateIQ / Spiff / Xactly in place; they run outbound from Airtable + Mailchimp / SendGrid + Slack, track commission natively in Airtable, build CPQ logic in Airtable rather than buy. So don't auto-recommend integrations with tools the customer probably doesn't have. **But** a real and growing audience is AI-native startups deliberately building on the new stack — Clay-style enrichment, AI SDR copilots, Granola / Fathom conversation intel, agentic prospecting. For these customers, Airtable's role is different: it's the data substrate where Clay-equivalent waterfall enrichment, AI-drafted outbound, and AI account-briefs can live natively (typed records + AI Field Agents + Automations + REST API). When the user's language signals AI-native sensibility (_"we don't have a CRM yet,"_ _"building on Clay / Apollo / Granola / Bardeen,"_ _"AI-first GTM"_), shift framing: Airtable is the open layer they can build their stack ON, not a fallback for teams that lack tooling. See `references/integrations.md#ai-native-stack-clay-equivalents-ai-sdrs-conversation-intel` for the patterns.
-   **Use MCP for what it currently supports; hand off to the UI for what it doesn't — and treat this as a capability gap, not a quality choice.** Query the live MCP (`mcp.airtable.com/mcp`) for the current tool surface rather than relying on any hardcoded list here, since the surface is evolving. For surfaces the MCP authors today, use the MCP path — it's faster, deterministic, and agent-driven. For surfaces it doesn't yet author, hand off via `[click here]` links to Airtable's UI. The UI path stays valid either way for users who want to tweak themselves; don't pretend the handoff is a quality decision when it's a capability boundary the user crosses with one click.
-   **Don't push CPQ as an integration.** Customers BUILD CPQ in Airtable — pricing tables, tiered formulas, DocuSign send — rather than buying Salesforce CPQ / DealHub / PandaDoc-as-CPQ. Help build pricing logic in Airtable; don't recommend an external CPQ tool.
-   **Don't push commission tools.** CaptivateIQ / Spiff / Xactly / QuotaPath rarely appear in the Airtable footprint. Commission tracking is done natively in Airtable for talent / brokerage / mortgage / sales-partner verticals — formulas + linked records do the work.
-   **Don't undersize the "lightweight CRM for sub-team" case.** A real archetype is the 3–5 person GTM team building "CRM lite" / "mini CRM" alongside the org's main CRM. Customer self-label: _"CRM lite"_, _"mini CRM"_, _"skunkworks service line CRM"_. Don't push canonical multi-table schemas on them.
-   **Don't oversize Salesforce-replacement at enterprise scale.** Full Salesforce replacement at large rep-counts is repeatedly asked but rarely ships. The "license reduction" pattern — Airtable as read-mostly UI for stakeholders who can't justify per-seat CRM licensing — is the realistic version at scale.
-   **Don't promise AI MEDDIC extraction at high accuracy.** Transcript ground truth is messy. Customers ask for it; deployed reality is partial / requires human verification. Surface the pattern with the caveat: AI drafts → human review, not autonomous.
-   **Don't autonomously run outbound email sequences via Airtable Automations.** Deliverability and CAN-SPAM / CASL implications push customers to Outreach / Salesloft eventually. AI-generated drafts → human review is the right pattern.
-   **Don't promise full-stack PRM** (partner conflict resolution, partner-led pipeline orchestration with MDF). Airtable does partner-CRM well — partner directory, joint account planning, deal registration — but partner-conflict-resolution at scale is core PRM-vendor territory.
-   **Don't replace Anaplan for territory & quota at the largest GTM orgs.** Territory planning at scale needs OR-grade rebalancing. Smaller-team quota tracking in Airtable is fine; large-org territory optimization isn't.
-   **Don't push the REST API tier unless the user wants it.** Native Airtable handles most sales-ops shapes well. Custom apps are the right answer when the user wants a branded experience that goes beyond what Interfaces / Portals can express, an embedded surface inside an existing product, a chat-driven workflow, or multi-tenant patterns — not the default for "build me a sales pipeline."
-   **Don't assume Claude or OpenAI access for AI features.** Approved-vendor LLM constraints are real (Gemini-only, no third-party LLMs in some regulated enterprises). Ask before recommending an AI integration tied to a specific provider.

When in doubt about which path to take, ask. Two scope questions cost ten seconds; rebuilding the wrong shape costs an hour.
