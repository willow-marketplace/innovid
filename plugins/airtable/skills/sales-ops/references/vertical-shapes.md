# Vertical-specific schema shapes

Detailed schemas for the verticals named in `SKILL.md`. Load the section that matches the user's industry; don't read the whole file. These build on the base schemas in `schema-shapes.md` — load that file too if the user's setup is greenfield.

Verticals here are based on patterns observed across deployed customer setups in the Airtable footprint. Industries where Airtable's flexibility matters more than enterprise-CRM features tend to cluster in these shapes.

## Brokerage / commission CRM

For talent agencies, real estate brokerages, mortgage brokers, financial advisors, insurance brokers, and any business where revenue is commissioned on deals closed by individual brokers.

### Distinctive elements

-   Brokers / talent / agents as a first-class entity (not just collaborators on the base)
-   Commission calculation per deal — typically `Deal Amount × Commission rate × Split %`
-   Probability-weighted expected commission for forecast
-   Pipeline organized around the broker / agent, not the territory
-   Brokerage / agency / firm as a top-level entity above brokers

### Tables (on top of the 3-table CRM shape)

-   **Brokers / Agents** — every commissioned individual.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary)
    -   `Type` (singleSelect: Broker, Agent, Talent manager, Partner)
    -   `Tier` (singleSelect: Junior, Senior, Principal) — drives commission rate
    -   `Default commission rate` (number, percent)
    -   `Active deals` (count of linked Opportunities where Stage ∉ Closed-\*)
    -   `YTD closed-won` (rollup sum of Opportunity Amount where Closed-Won + this year)
    -   `YTD expected commission` (rollup or formula)
-   **Opportunities (commission-shaped)** — replaces / extends the base Opportunities table.
    -   `Name` (singleLineText, primary) — usually `[Account] [scope]` or `[Talent] [deal]`
    -   `Broker / Agent` (multipleRecordLinks → Brokers)
    -   `Co-broker` (multipleRecordLinks → Brokers, for split commission)
    -   `Split %` (number, percent) — for primary broker on split deals
    -   `Co-broker split %` (number, percent)
    -   `Commission rate override` (number, percent — overrides broker default when this deal differs)
    -   `Effective commission rate` (formula = `IF({Commission rate override}, {Commission rate override}, {Broker.Default commission rate})`)
    -   `Deal Amount` (currency)
    -   `Probability` (number, percent)
    -   `Expected commission` (formula = `Deal Amount × Effective commission rate × Split % × Probability`)
    -   Standard fields: Stage, Expected close, Lead source, etc.
-   **Commission payouts** — historical commission records once a deal closes.
    -   `Opportunity` (multipleRecordLinks → Opportunities)
    -   `Broker / Agent` (multipleRecordLinks → Brokers)
    -   `Closed amount` (currency) — actual deal close amount, may differ from forecast
    -   `Commission paid` (currency)
    -   `Pay period` (date or singleSelect by quarter)
    -   `Paid status` (singleSelect: Pending, Paid, Disputed)

### Variants

-   **Real estate brokerage**: see Real estate vertical below — adds pursuit stages, property records, MSA fields.
-   **Talent agency**: Talent table (clients represented by the agent) separate from external parties (brands, opportunities). Talent commission deals tracked by Talent × Brand. Customer language: _"book of business"_, _"signing"_, _"brand partnership"_.
-   **Mortgage broker**: see Mortgage operations vertical below.
-   **Financial advisor**: AUM-based commission instead of per-deal. Add AUM tracking per client; commission is a rate × AUM annualized.

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Per-broker dashboard (Interface page): YTD closed-won, YTD commission, active deals, top opportunities

-   **Win/loss analysis** for retrospective learning

Pattern observed at large infrastructure / construction firms with structured pursuit policies.

-   **Approval expiration**: 90-day deal-reg protection windows trigger a reminder to the partner before expiration.
-   **External-collaborator access**: partners log into a restricted Airtable Interface page (or a custom-app surface per `build-shapes.md`) to view their pipeline and update their deal regs.

### Views and interfaces to hand off

-   Partner directory (filtered by Tier, Region, Status)
-   Deal reg triage queue (channel manager view)
-   Partner-led pipeline rollup by Partner × Stage
-   Joint account plan interface (per-account view)

## Choosing between vertical shapes

If the user's industry is clear, lead with the matching vertical shape. If they describe a workflow that spans verticals (e.g., a financial services firm doing both wealth management and capital markets), pick the dominant pattern and add tables from the other vertical as needed.

When the user's industry is unclear, default to the standard mid or CRM-augmentation shape in `schema-shapes.md` and confirm the vertical during scope conversation. Don't pick a niche vertical shape without confirmation — the schema overhead is real and switching after scaffolding is expensive.
