# Check Usage

Read-only view of the account's plan, credits, and usage. No credits consumed, no changes made.

## Examples

- `/hunter:check-usage How many credits do I have left?`
- `"What plan am I on?"`
- `"How many searches have I used this month?"`
- `"Show my account details"`

## Steps

1. **Read the account** → `Get-Account-Details` for plan and reset date; `Get-Usage` for search/verification consumption and what's remaining. Neither tool returns a team name — don't show one.

2. **Present a clear summary — show what's REMAINING, not the allowance.** Use `requests.credits.remaining` when the account has a single credits bucket; otherwise compute `available - used` per bucket. (`available` is the period allowance plus packs, not what's left.)

```
# Account Usage

| | Used | Remaining | Resets |
|--|------|-----------|--------|
| **Searches** | 320 | 180 | 2026-08-01 |
| **Verifications** | 140 | 860 | 2026-08-01 |

**Plan:** Starter
```

3. **If the user is close to a limit,** flag it: "You've used 90% of your monthly searches — they reset on [date]."

## Credit Cost

Free — reading account details and usage consumes no credits.

## Important Notes

- Read-only. This skill never creates API keys, changes the plan, or edits account settings — those stay in the Hunter dashboard.
- Handy as a pre-check before running bulk verification or enrichment.
