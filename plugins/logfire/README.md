# logfire

Add [Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/) observability to Python applications.

## Features

- `/instrument` - detect frameworks and add Logfire instrumentation
- `/debug` - investigate errors using Logfire traces via MCP
- `/query` - query traces, logs, and metrics interactively or add query capabilities to code
- `logfire-ui` skill - open Logfire project pages, live views, traces, and Explore filters directly in Codex
- SKILL.md with core Logfire patterns (configure, instrument, structured logging, AI/LLM instrumentation)
- MCP server for querying Logfire data

## Query vs UI Routing

The Codex Logfire plugin uses one primary workflow per request:

| User intent | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Analyze, query, count, summarize, compare, or find root cause | Use `logfire-query` and return analysis in chat. |
| Open, show in browser, live view, Explore, Logfire UI, or give a link | Use `logfire-ui` and open or return a Logfire URL without querying first. |
| Ambiguous prompts like "show recent errors" or "view logs" | Ask whether the user wants a UI view or query analysis. |
| Explicit combined prompts like "analyze this and give me a link" | Do the requested query work, then provide the relevant Logfire link. |

For UI requests that omit the organization/project, the agent should resolve the current project through Logfire MCP auth/current-project metadata before asking the user. Environment values such as `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL`, `LOGFIRE_URL`, and exporter config identify the platform/API base only; they are not enough to infer the target organization/project.

## Install In Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add pydantic/skills
claude plugin install logfire@pydantic-skills
```

The Claude plugin provides `/instrument`, `/debug`, `/query`, and the Logfire MCP server.

## Install In Codex

Add the published Pydantic marketplace to Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add pydantic/skills
```

Then enable **Logfire** from the Codex plugin UI. The Codex plugin metadata lives in `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and configures:

- display name **Logfire**
- category **Coding**
- capabilities **Interactive** and **Write**
- Logfire icon and pink brand color
- Logfire skills for instrumentation, querying, and UI-opening workflows
- MCP server from `.codex-plugin/mcp.json`

For local development after changing this plugin, refresh the Codex plugin cache:

```bash
./scripts/reload-codex-plugin.sh logfire
```

A new Codex conversation may be required for updated skills, MCP servers, icons, or metadata to load.

## Install In Cursor

Install the Logfire plugin from the published [pydantic/skills](https://github.com/pydantic/skills) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pydantic/skills.git
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
cp -R skills/plugins/logfire ~/.cursor/plugins/local/logfire
```

Then restart Cursor or run **Developer: Reload Window**. The Cursor plugin metadata lives in `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` and configures:

- display name **Logfire**
- Logfire skills for instrumentation, querying, and UI-opening workflows
- hosted Logfire MCP server from `mcp.json`

## MCP

The Logfire MCP server is configured automatically when you install the plugin. By default it
targets the US region endpoint (`https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/mcp`). The plugin's skills and
commands are region-independent; only the MCP server entry differs per region.

### EU region and self-hosted instances

**Claude Code** reads the endpoint from the `LOGFIRE_MCP_URL` environment variable, so set it in
the shell where you launch Claude Code:

```bash
export LOGFIRE_MCP_URL=https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev/mcp
```

This needs plugin version 0.1.4 or later; on earlier versions the URL is hardcoded. Run
`claude plugin list` to see the installed version and the marketplace it came from, then update
and restart Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update pydantic-skills
claude plugin update logfire@pydantic-skills
```

If you installed from Anthropic's `claude-plugins-official` marketplace instead, substitute that
name. That marketplace pins a specific commit of this repository, so a release can take longer to
appear there than on `pydantic-skills`, which tracks `main`.

**Codex** users can switch by replacing the MCP entry and re-authenticating:

```bash
codex mcp remove logfire
codex mcp add logfire --url https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev/mcp
codex mcp login logfire
codex mcp get logfire
```

Start a new Codex conversation after switching so the MCP tools reload.

**Cursor** installs are a local copy, so edit the `url` in
`~/.cursor/plugins/local/logfire/mcp.json` and reload the window.

In Claude Code, `.mcp.json` configures the `logfire` MCP server. In Codex, `.codex-plugin/mcp.json`
configures it. In Cursor, `mcp.json` configures the same hosted server.

The Logfire MCP server requires normal Logfire authentication, such as `logfire auth` or a suitable `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`.
