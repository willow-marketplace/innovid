name: box-legal-workflows-intake
description: Automate legal client intake and onboarding with Box MCP — review uploaded intake documents for completeness against firm requirements, assess risk levels based on client profile and document content (PEP status, conflicts, sanctions, litigation history), route incomplete or high-risk submissions to appropriate attorneys with context and risk summaries, extract structured metadata (client name, matter type, jurisdiction, value), and generate engagement letters from Box DocGen templates for approved low-risk clients. Use this skill when the user mentions client intake, client onboarding, new client review, intake documents, engagement letters, or needs to process prospective client submissions stored in Box.

# Client Intake & Onboarding

> **PREREQUISITES:**
> - Read `box:box` for Box MCP auth, tool selection, base workflows. If missing, run: `npx skills add https://github.com/box/box-for-ai --skill box`
> - Read `box-legal-workflows` for risk frameworks, confidentiality, human-in-the-loop requirements, Box AI governance. If missing, ensure it's installed from the same skill package.

Legal client intake determines if the firm can and should take on a prospective client. This skill automates completeness checks, risk assessment, intelligent routing, and engagement letter generation.

**Core principles:** Completeness first, risk-based routing, transparent decisions, human oversight for high-risk.

## Completeness & Risk Framework

### Required Documents Checklist

**[CONFIRM: What documents required for intake?]**

**Typical:**
- Client intake form (completed questionnaire)
- Valid government ID (passport, driver's license)
- Conflict check authorization
- Source of funds documentation (certain practice areas)
- Business entity documents (corporate: articles, operating agreement)

**Optional/practice-specific:**
- Financial statements (bankruptcy, tax)
- Prior legal proceedings (litigation)
- Contracts or agreements (transactional)

**Validation questions:**
1. Document present?
2. Complete? (not blank, has expected info)
3. Valid? (ID not expired, forms signed, dates current)

### Risk Rating

**[CONFIRM: Low/medium/high risk criteria for your firm?]**

**See box-legal-workflows for:** General risk framework.

**Low-risk:** Individual client, standard matter, no litigation, clear funds, all docs complete, no conflicts, value below threshold.

**High-risk:** PEP, high-value, cross-border with sanctions, conflict identified, criminal with media, reputational risk.

### Routing Logic

**[CONFIRM: How to route intakes?]**

**Route based on:**
1. **Practice area**: Match matter to attorney expertise
2. **Risk level**: Low → associate, Medium → senior, High → partner
3. **Workload**: Current caseload if known
4. **Jurisdiction**: Attorney bar admission
5. **Language**: Attorney language capabilities

**Example matrix:**

| Risk | Route To | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Low | Auto-approve OR associate | Generate engagement letter (if allowed) |
| Medium | Senior attorney | Add comment with risk summary |
| High | Partner + Compliance | Detailed analysis, block auto-processing |
| Incomplete | Intake coordinator | List missing documents |

## Tool Selection

| Task | Primary Tool | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| List intake folder | `list_folder_content_by_folder_id` | Get all submission files |
| Review documents | `ai_qa_multi_file` | Completeness & validity |
| Extract data | `ai_extract_structured_from_fields_enhanced` | Name, matter, dates |
| Assess risk | `ai_qa_multi_file` | Multi-file risk analysis |
| Create summary | `upload_file` | Write summary doc |
| Write metadata | `set_file_metadata` | Record decision, risk, attorney |
| Tag for review | `create_file_comment` | Tag attorney with instructions |
| Grant access | `create_collaboration` | Give attorney access |
| Generate letter | **[CONFIRM: DocGen?]** | Need template access |
| Share with client | `add_folder_shared_link` OR `create_collaboration` | Provide client access |

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Intake Review
1. **Authenticate**: `who_am_i`
2. **[CONFIRM: Intake folder ID?]**
3. **Inventory**: `list_folder_content_by_folder_id`
4. **[CONFIRM: Map files to required checklist]**
5. **Assess completeness**: `ai_qa_multi_file` (questions for each doc)
6. **Extract info**: **[CONFIRM: Fields?]** → `ai_extract_structured_from_fields_enhanced`

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment
7. **Risk analysis**: `ai_qa_multi_file` (PEP, sanctions, conflicts, litigation, high value, inconsistencies)
8. **Assign rating**: **[CONFIRM: Match firm's criteria?]**

### Phase 3: Decision & Routing
9. **Determine action**:
   - **INCOMPLETE**: **[CONFIRM: Who follows up?]**
   - **HIGH RISK**: **[CONFIRM: Who reviews? Block auto-processing?]**
   - **MEDIUM RISK**: **[CONFIRM: Who based on practice area?]**
   - **LOW RISK**: **[CONFIRM: Auto-approve or needs review?]**

10. **Save summary**: `upload_file` (completeness, risk, factors, action)
11. **Write metadata**: **[CONFIRM: Template exists?]** → `set_file_metadata`

### Phase 4: Routing & Collaboration
12. **Add comment**: **[CONFIRM: Who to tag?]** → `create_file_comment`
13. **Grant access**: **[CONFIRM: Permission level?]** → `create_collaboration`

### Phase 5: Engagement Letter (If Low-Risk Auto-Approve)
14. **Generate letter**: **[CONFIRM: DocGen template ID?]** → Use DocGen if available
15. **Save**: `upload_file`
16. **Share**: **[CONFIRM: How? Expiration?]** → `create_collaboration` or `add_folder_shared_link`

## Guardrails

**See box-legal-workflows for:** Human-in-the-loop requirements, confidentiality, Box AI governance.

**Intake-specific:**

**ALWAYS confirm before:**
1. Auto-approving any client (even low-risk)
2. Generating engagement letters without attorney review
3. Sharing engagement letters with clients
4. Assigning risk ratings
5. Routing to specific attorneys
6. Copying files to externally-accessible folders (if file was NOT already externally accessible)

**CONFIRM if uncertain:**
7. Document completeness (if missing docs or validity is ambiguous)
8. Extracted metadata (if values are unclear or contradictory)

**Proceed autonomously when confident:**
- Writing metadata when extraction is clear and unambiguous
- Copying/organizing intake files between folders (internal-only to internal-only, or external to external)
- Creating intake summary reports
- Extracting client information with high confidence
- Assessing document completeness when criteria are clear

**NEVER auto-approve without authorization:**
- High-risk clients
- Matters above value threshold
- Clients in sanctioned jurisdictions
- Matters with conflicts
- Any category requiring human review per firm policy

**Decision transparency:**
- Document WHY (risk factors, missing docs)
- Cite which documents reviewed
- Record WHO decided (human or automated)
- Timestamp
- Make summary available to assigned attorney

**Box AI usage:**
- Pace 1-2 seconds apart
- Context: "Assessing risk for law firm intake. Identify red flags..."
- Surface specific passages supporting assessment
- Human attorney must review final decision
