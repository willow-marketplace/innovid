"""Behavioral test for the `serving-llms-on-instinct` skill.

Serves a deliberately tiny model (``Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B``) end-to-end on real AMD
Instinct hardware so the run stays fast: no HF token needed (Apache 2.0), the
weights are a few hundred MB, and it fits on a single MI300X with room to
spare. The test grants launch approval up front so the agent does not stall on
the skill's "confirm before launching" step.

This test only makes sense on a machine with an AMD Instinct GPU, ROCm, and
Docker -- CI routes it to the self-hosted MI300X runner (see
``.github/workflows/behavioral.yml``). Run locally the same way as the other
behavioral tests:

    cd eval/behavioral
    python -m pytest -c pytest.ini -p conftest \
        ../../skills/serving-llms-on-instinct/evals/evals.py

Each check on `run` prints a `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` line and raises on failure, so
the test fails at the first unmet expectation. `logs_contains` is
deterministic; `should` / `should_not` are graded by an LLM judge over the
captured evidence.

    The behavioral harness cleans up the temp workspace but knows nothing

    the ``--model`` argument in the container command -- so we never touch
    someone else's endpoint, but we still catch containers the agent named
    differently than the skill's template suggests.

    This runs *before* the agent as well as after: a container left behind by
    an earlier run is a healthy endpoint the agent will reasonably reuse
