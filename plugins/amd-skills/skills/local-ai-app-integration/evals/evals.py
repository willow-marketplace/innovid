"""Behavioral tests for the `local-ai-app-integration` skill.

Run locally (needs the `claude` CLI authenticated):

    cd eval/behavioral
    python -m pytest -c pytest.ini -p conftest \
        ../../skills/local-ai-app-integration/evals/evals.py

Prompts are scoped to code-generation only ("Do not download or install
anything") to avoid the agent attempting the GitHub download, which hangs
indefinitely. Checks prefer `logs_contains` / `workspace_contains` (instant)
over `should` / `should_not` (spawns a judge subprocess) wherever possible.
