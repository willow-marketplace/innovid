"""Behavioral tests for the `local-ai-use` skill.

Run locally (needs the `claude` CLI authenticated and a reachable Lemonade
Server -- otherwise the suite skips):

    cd eval/behavioral
    python -m pytest -c pytest.ini -p conftest ../../skills/local-ai-use/evals/evals.py

Each check on `run` prints a `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` line and raises on failure, so
the test fails at the first unmet expectation. `logs_contains` /
`workspace_contains` are deterministic; `should` / `should_not` are graded by
an LLM judge over the captured evidence.
