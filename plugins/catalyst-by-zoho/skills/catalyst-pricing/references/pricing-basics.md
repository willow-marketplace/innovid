## Billing Rules

1. **Free tier is account-wide** — shared across all projects.
2. **Minimum $5/project/month** once a project exceeds the free tier — the minimum is billed *per project*. Example: project A has $7 of billable usage and project B has $3 (below the $5 floor). A is billed its actual $7; B is billed the $5 minimum → $7 + $5 = $12.
3. **Billable = Max(0, Usage - Free Tier)**. Cost = Billable × Unit Price.
4. **Free trial credits ($250)** applied against invoices. Once the credits are exhausted or the 60-day trial period ends (whichever comes first), normal billing begins.

## GB-Seconds Calculation

```
GB-seconds = (Memory in MB / 1024) × Execution Time in Seconds × Number of Invocations
```

**Example:** 500 invocations, 512 MB, 2 seconds each:
```
GB-seconds = (512/1024) × 2 × 500 = 500 GB-sec
Cost = (500 - 25,000 free) = 0 billable → $0.00
```

### Cost per invocation at each memory tier (1-second duration)

| Memory (MB) | Cost per invocation | 10K/month | 100K/month |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| 128 | $0.000002 | $0.02 | $0.20 |
| 256 | $0.000004 | $0.04 | $0.40 |
| 512 | $0.000008 | $0.08 | $0.80 |
| 1024 | $0.000016 | $0.16 | $1.60 |

**Key insight:** 128 MB is **8× cheaper per second** than 1024 MB. Choose the smallest memory that doesn't cause failures.

## Typical Monthly Costs

| App Type | Range | Primary Drivers |
|---|---|---|
| Simple web app (< 1K users) | $0–$10 | Within or near free tier |
| API backend (10K req/day) | $5–$50 | Data Store, Functions, API Gateway |
| Data processing (1M rows/mo) | $50–$500 | Data Store writes, Job Scheduling |
| Data processing (100M rows/mo) | $2,000–$30,000+ | Data Store writes dominate |
| ML-powered app | $10–$200 | Zia APIs, QuickML, Data Store |
| Chat application | $5–$50 | ConvoKraft, Functions, Cache |

## Cost Estimation Pitfalls

1. **Processing multiplier** — one user action triggers multiple ops. E.g., "save record" = 1 INSERT + 2 SELECTs + 1 Cache PUT + 1 event.
2. **DataStore is often the dominant cost** for data-heavy apps. INSERT at $0.0001/request adds up fast.
3. **Cache reduces DataStore costs** — higher cache hit rate = fewer SELECT calls.
4. **APM costs scale with executions** — at millions of executions, $0.00002/req becomes material.
5. **Free tier erodes at scale** — don't over-optimize for free tier savings in large projections.

## INR & Regional Pricing

Catalyst invoices in the currency attached to the credit card:
- **US DC** → USD, **IN DC** → INR, **EU DC** → EUR

For INR rates, visit https://catalyst.zoho.com/pricing.html from an India DC account.
All estimates in this skill are in USD. For INR pricing, direct users to the official pricing page.

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Cost estimate doesn't match invoice | Free tier resets monthly; partial months billed at full rate | Always calculate based on full month usage; free tier is per calendar month |
| INR pricing differs from USD estimate | Separate regional pricing applies to India DC accounts | Direct India DC users to catalyst.zoho.com/pricing.html for accurate INR rates |
| Unexpected GB-seconds charge | Cold start overhead counted toward execution time | Cold starts add ~100–300 ms; factor this in for high-frequency functions |
| Free tier exhausted earlier than expected | Multiple environments (Development + Production) share the same free tier quota | Each Catalyst project counts as one quota pool across all environments |
