## Philosophy

- **Prefer MCP over asking — for *resource* IDs, not for the org/project itself.** If the `ZohoMCP_*` meta-tools are available, use them to fetch table IDs, ZAIDs, bucket names, etc. (the `CatalystbyZoho_*` operations are invoked *through* them — see below); never ask the user to copy those from the console.
- **🔒 NEVER assume the org or project.** The active org/project must always be *resolved* from an authoritative source (`.catalystrc`, or an MCP list the user confirms) — never guessed, inferred from the directory name, carried over from a past session, or auto-picked because "only one showed up." A single project in the list is **not** permission to select it silently — confirm it. **If no project is initialized (`.catalystrc` absent) or the project cannot be resolved, STOP and ask the user which project (and org) to work in** before any CLI command, MCP resource call, scaffold, or deploy. This is the one place the "prefer MCP over asking" default does not apply — see the Golden Rule in `skills/catalyst-basics/references/preflight.md`.
- **Default to Development (via Local first).** Iterate against Local, then deploy to the Development environment — never target Production unless the user explicitly says "production" or "deploy to prod". Production is reached only by migrating a verified Development setup up, not by direct deploys or resource creation.
- **"Build an app" means Slate + Function by default.** When a user says "build an app", "create an app", or "make a simple app" without specifying backend-only, the default output is a **Slate frontend + Advanced I/O function backend**. Do NOT build only a function and call it an app. If the user's intent is clearly backend-only (e.g. "build an API", "write a function"), skip Slate.
- **Local-first: serve and test before you deploy.** Catalyst has three environments — **Local** (the dev machine), **Development** (remote sandbox), and **Production** (remote, live). For any component you run yourself (Functions, AppSail, Slate), always **`catalyst serve` and test locally first**, then `catalyst deploy` to Development, and only migrate up to Production once Development is verified. Never deploy freshly written or changed serve-able code to Development without a local serve + test pass first, unless the user explicitly says to skip it. Local is coupled to Development (managed-service calls like Data Store/Stratus proxy to Development). The canonical model + loop lives in `skills/catalyst-basics/references/project-basics.md` → **Environments**.
- **Prefer Functions over AppSail for simple HTTP.** Functions are cheaper (per-invocation billing), simpler to deploy, and require no infrastructure management. Reach for AppSail only when the use case genuinely requires a persistent process, or a custom runtime.
- **Show cost before building.** For any new infrastructure (functions, AppSail, Stratus buckets), load `catalyst-pricing` and give a brief estimate before writing code. Most small projects stay within free tier — say so when true.
- **Recommend the current service, not the deprecated one.** File Store → Stratus. Event Listeners → Signals. Cron → Job Scheduling. Never mention the deprecated name in generated code or config.
- **Warn before the region bites.** Circuits and Integration Functions do not work in most data centers. Check the user's DC before suggesting them.

## How It Works

1. **Pre-flight** — Check that `.catalystrc` and `catalyst.json` exist. If missing, use MCP to get org/project IDs and run `catalyst init --org <orgId> -p <projectId> -ni`. Never use interactive `catalyst init`.
2. **MCP check** — Look for the `ZohoMCP_*` meta-tools (`ZohoMCP_getSchema`, `ZohoMCP_executeTool`, `ZohoMCP_listTools`, `ZohoMCP_getFeatures`). Their presence is the "MCP connected" signal — the `CatalystbyZoho_*` names never appear as tools. If present, use MCP to fetch org/project IDs instead of asking the user.
3. **Route** — Match the query to the most specific service in the routing table below.
4. **Load lazily** — Read ONLY the single reference file needed for the current step. Do NOT preload multiple skills upfront. For "build an app" requests: (a) assume **Slate frontend + AIO function** unless the user says backend-only, (b) sketch the architecture briefly and confirm with the user before building, (c) then load one reference file per service as you write each part — `catalyst-slate` for the frontend, `catalyst-functions` for the backend.
5. **Cost check** — Only load `catalyst-pricing` if the user specifically asks about cost, or if the plan includes AppSail, Stratus, or other paid-tier services. Skip for basic Functions + DataStore projects (likely free tier).
6. **Answer** — Provide code examples using the user's platform (Node.js, Python, Java, Web, or Mobile).
7. **Serve & test locally, then deploy** — For any component you run yourself (Functions, AppSail, Slate), `catalyst serve` and test it locally before `catalyst deploy` to Development. Deploy to Development only after the local pass succeeds; promote to Production only after Development is verified. See the local-first loop in `catalyst-basics/references/project-basics.md` → **Environments**.

## Triggers

Use this skill for queries containing: Catalyst, zcatalyst, AppSail, Data Store, ZCQL, Cache, Stratus, Slate, NoSQL, Zia Services, QuickML, API Gateway, Connections, Zoho MCP, CatalystbyZoho, `catalyst init`, `catalyst deploy`, `catalyst serve`, `zcatalyst-sdk-node`, `catalyst-config.json`, Catalyst pricing, "build on Zoho's platform", or "deploy to Catalyst". Do NOT use for generic Zoho CRM questions unless Catalyst is the target.

## 🛑 Pre-flight gate (project-mutating tasks only)

> **The canonical readiness sequence lives in `skills/catalyst-basics/references/preflight.md`.** It is the single source of truth for establishing + reconciling org/project and environment awareness. Follow it for the full flow; the summary below only covers the MCP-connectivity signal and how to call the tools.

**Step 1 — MCP check (do this before anything else for infrastructure tasks):**
Look for the `ZohoMCP_*` **meta-tools** in your tool list — `ZohoMCP_getSchema`, `ZohoMCP_executeTool`, `ZohoMCP_listTools`, `ZohoMCP_getFeatures`. Their presence is the "MCP connected" signal. The `CatalystbyZoho_*` names are **not** shown as tools — they are `tool_name` values you pass to `ZohoMCP_executeTool`.
- **If the meta-tools are present** — use MCP to fetch org/project IDs. Never ask the user to copy IDs from the console.
  **How to call MCP tools correctly:**
  1. `ZohoMCP_getSchema` takes `query_params`, NOT `body`:
     ```
     ZohoMCP_getSchema({ query_params: { tool_name: "CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Projects" } })
     ```
  2. Always call `ZohoMCP_getSchema` first for any `CatalystbyZoho_*` tool — never guess the argument shape. Many tools require `path_variables` (e.g. `project_id`) that are invisible without the schema.
  3. `ZohoMCP_executeTool` takes a `body` with this shape:
     ```
     ZohoMCP_executeTool({ body: {
       tool_name: "CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Functions",
       arguments: {
         path_variables: { project_id: "31594000000127002" },
         headers: {},
         body: {}
       }
     }})
     ```
  4. Tools with no required path variables (e.g. `List_All_Organizations`, `List_All_Projects`) can be called with `arguments: {}`.
- **If the meta-tools are NOT present and the task creates resources, writes files, deploys, or reads project IDs** — **HARD STOP.** Do NOT write any code or create any files. Tell the user:
  > "Zoho MCP needs to be connected before I can work with your Catalyst project. Load the `catalyst-zoho-mcp` skill to set it up — it takes under a minute."
  Do not proceed until `CatalystbyZoho_*` tools are visible.

**This gate applies only when the task writes Catalyst project files, deploys, reads project/environment IDs, or performs MCP project operations.** Skip it for informational questions (pricing, architecture advice, service selection, "what is Catalyst?", install help, SDK usage, or any question that doesn't require an initialized project).

**For project-mutating tasks: verify `.catalystrc` and `catalyst.json` exist in the working directory.**
- **If present** → that project is authoritative; reconcile it with MCP per the pre-flight and use it.
- **If missing** → the workspace is not initialized against any project. **Do NOT assume one.** Follow the canonical resolution in `skills/catalyst-basics/references/preflight.md` → "If `.catalystrc` is absent":
  1. List orgs via MCP — auto-use only when exactly one exists; **ask the user if 2+**.
  2. List projects via MCP. **If zero projects exist, or more than one, or even exactly one — STOP and ask/confirm with the user which project to work in.** A lone project is not permission to auto-select it.
  3. Only after the org and project are **confirmed with the user** run:
     ```bash
     catalyst init --org <orgId> -p <projectId> -ni
     ```
  **Never ask the user to run `catalyst init` interactively. Never create `.catalystrc` or `catalyst.json` yourself — they must be generated by the CLI.**
  **Note:** NI mode can only link an *existing* project. If no project exists yet, tell the user to create one in the Catalyst console, then come back — you'll link it with `catalyst init -ni`. Never scaffold or deploy against a made-up project ID.

## ⛔ Never Use (deprecated + regionally restricted)

### Deprecated services — do not use for new projects

Users who signed up **after August 27, 2025** cannot access these components at all.

| Do not use | Use this instead |
|------------|------------------|
| ~~File Store~~ | **Stratus** (object storage) |
| ~~Event Listeners~~ | **Signals** (event-driven architecture) |
| ~~Cron~~ | **Job Scheduling** (scheduled execution) |

### Regionally restricted services — check DC before recommending

These services are **unavailable** in the listed data centers. Building with them for users in those regions results in runtime failures.

| Service | Not available in |
|---------|------------------|
| **Circuits** | EU, AU, IN, JP, SA, CA, UAE |
| **Integration Functions** | EU, AU, IN, JP, SA, CA, UAE |
| **Push Notifications** | EU, AU, IN, CA, UAE |
| **AutoML (QuickML)** | EU, AU, IN, JP, SA, CA, UAE |
| **Identity Scanner (Zia)** | Available in IN DC only (not EU, AU, US, JP, SA, CA, UAE) |
| **Mobile Device Management** | EU, AU, IN, JP, SA, CA, UAE |

**How to check:** Ask the user which data center their Catalyst account uses, or look for the DC code in their console URL (e.g., `catalyst.zoho.in` → IN, `catalyst.zoho.eu` → EU).

---

## Non-Interactive Mode

CLI v1.27.0+ supports non-interactive (NI) mode — the CLI takes all answers from flags and sensible defaults instead of prompting.

**Enable:** Add `-ni` (or `--non-interactive`) to any supported command, or set `ZCATALYST_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` in the environment.

**Disabled commands:** `functions:setup` → use `functions:add -ni`; `functions:shell` → use `functions:execute`

**Blocked options:** `--remote` on `functions:delete` and `client:delete` is not allowed in NI mode.

**Tip:** `catalyst <command> -ni --help` shows the NI-specific help for that command.

---

## `.catalystrc` — Reading org and project context

After `catalyst init`, a `.catalystrc` file is written to the project root. Read it at the start of any session to identify the active project without asking the user.

**Actual format:**
```json
{
  "defaults": { "project": 1, "env": 1 },
  "actives":  { "project": 1, "env": 1 },
  "projects": [
    {
      "idx": 1,
      "id": "<projectId>",
      "name": "<projectName>",
      "domain": { "id": "<domainId>", "name": "<projectName>-<orgId>.development" },
      "env": [{ "idx": 1, "id": "<orgId>", "name": "Development", "type": 3 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**How to read the active project ID and org ID:**
1. Read `defaults.project` → this is the active project's `idx` value
2. Find the entry in `projects` where `idx` matches → get its `id` → this is the **project ID** to use with `-p`
3. From the same entry, read `env[0].id` → this is the **org ID** to use with `--org`

## Quick-reference: Top gotchas

- **TERMINOLOGY: always say "organization" or "org", NEVER "portal"** — the `catalyst init` CLI prompt says "Select a default Catalyst portal" but this is the CLI's legacy wording; the correct term is organization
- **`.catalystrc` / `catalyst.json` missing** → run `catalyst init --org <orgId> -p <projectId> -ni` (get IDs from MCP); never create these files manually, never use interactive `catalyst init`
- **All Catalyst CLI commands default to non-interactive** (CLI v1.27.0+) — always use `-ni` with `--org`, `-p`, `--name`, `--type`, `--stack` flags; never fall back to interactive/arrow-key menus in agent context
- **`catalyst functions:add` non-interactive** — `catalyst functions:add --name <n> --type <type> --stack <stack> -ni`
- **ZCQL result rows are wrapped** → `rows.map(r => r.TableName)` to unwrap
- **ZCQL max 300 rows/query** → use `LIMIT offset, count` for pagination
- **ZAID differs between Dev and Prod** → #1 auth issue in production
- **AppSail PORT** → `process.env.X_ZOHO_CATALYST_LISTEN_PORT` (not `PORT`)
- **Cache values are strings only** → serialize/deserialize JSON yourself
- **Stratus bucket names are globally unique** → use `{app-name}-{project-id-prefix}`
- **Slate → function calls are cross-domain** → use full URL + `generateAuthToken()` + CORS whitelist
- **DataStore App User permissions OFF by default** → enable in Console → Table → Scopes and Permissions
- **`catalyst-config.json` format** → `deployment` + `execution` keys only; NOT `function` or `entry_point`
- **Advanced I/O node20 `req`** → raw `http.IncomingMessage`; use `sendJson(res, ...)` helper, not `res.json()`
- **`signOut()` requires a redirect URL** → `catalyst.auth.signOut(redirectURL)`
