## How It Works

1. **Check if MCP is connected** — Look for the `ZohoMCP_*` **meta-tools** (`ZohoMCP_getSchema`, `ZohoMCP_executeTool`, `ZohoMCP_listTools`, `ZohoMCP_getFeatures`) in your tool list. Their presence is the connectivity signal. The `CatalystbyZoho_*` names are **not** shown as tools — they are `tool_name` values passed to `ZohoMCP_executeTool`.

2. **⛔ MCP NOT connected — HARD STOP.**
   Do NOT write any code, create any files, or call any SDK.
   Ask the user which setup path they prefer, then load `references/zoho-mcp.md` and follow only that path.
   Do not proceed to step 3 until the `ZohoMCP_*` meta-tools are present in the tool list (this is the "MCP connected" signal — the `CatalystbyZoho_*` names never appear as tools).

   > **To work with Catalyst via MCP, choose your setup path:**
   >
   > **Option A — Global MCP Server** *(recommended)*
  > Add your DC-specific URL to your AI client config, authorize once via browser, done. No console needed. Pick your DC's URL from the table in `references/zoho-mcp.md` (setup) — or `references/dc-switching.md` to change DCs later.
   >
   > **Option B — Personal MCP Server** *(custom/team setup)*
   > Create your own server at mcp.zoho.com, select tools, get a personal URL with a token embedded.
   >
   > *Which would you prefer?*

3. **DC switch request?** — If the user asks to switch data centers (e.g. "connect to IN DC", "switch to EU", "logout of MCP server"), load `references/dc-switching.md` and follow it. Do not use `zoho-mcp.md` for this.

4. **Pre-flight sequence** — Once per session, before your first MCP tool call, follow the single canonical pre-flight in `../catalyst-basics/references/preflight.md`: read org (`projects[].env[].id`) and project (`projects[].id`) from `.catalystrc` and confirm parity with MCP via `CatalystbyZoho_Get_Project_By_Id`, or resolve via `List_All_Organizations` → `List_All_Projects` when `.catalystrc` is absent. Once it passes, trust the context for the rest of the session — do not re-verify before every call.

5. **Load `references/zoho-mcp.md`** — for the full tool catalog, execution flow, and common error fixes.

6. **If the query involves DataStore** (create table, add columns, query data) — also load `references/mcp-datastore.md`.

7. **Answer** — Invoke the appropriate `CatalystbyZoho_*` operation via `ZohoMCP_executeTool` (passing its name as the `tool_name` argument; fetch its schema first with `ZohoMCP_getSchema`). Show the user which operation was called and what it returned.
