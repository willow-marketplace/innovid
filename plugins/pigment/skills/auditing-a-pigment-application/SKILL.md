# Auditing a Pigment Application

Run a structured, read-only audit. Do not modify anything unless the user explicitly asks for fixes after reviewing the report.

## CRITICAL -- Collect Formula Health Evidence First

Start every audit with `tool:list_issues` to surface active formula computation errors. These are highest-severity because they produce wrong or missing outputs.

For each errored block, retrieve its formula with `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` (`show_details: true`) and identify the root cause (type mismatch, missing reference, scenario-specific failure). Use `tool:get_metric_dependencies` on errored blocks to trace downstream impact and distinguish root causes from cascading symptoms.

## CRITICAL -- Trace Dependency Fragility

Use `tool:get_metric_dependencies` on critical output metrics (cashflow totals, P&L summaries, KPIs).

Flag:

- Long chains where a single upstream error cascades to many outputs
- Missing intermediate metrics (too much logic in one formula)
- Fragile roll-forward patterns (e.g. `CUMULATE` + `SELECT: Month-1` without clear beginning/ending balance separation)

## HIGH -- Scan Formula Patterns

Use `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` with `formula_regex_search` pattern queries. Do not rewrite formulas during the audit. For the full anti-pattern reference, see `skill:writing-performant-formulas`. For AR anti-patterns, see `skill:securing-with-access-rights`.

Flag these patterns (highest priority first):

- **Unguarded `ACCESSRIGHTS`**: no `IFDEFINED('Users roles', ...)` guard — AR computed for every user
- **`ACCESSRIGHTS` guarded only by `IFDEFINED(User, ...)`**: flag for review — not a substitute for `'Users roles'`
- **`ACCESSRIGHTS(x, FALSE)`**: densifies denied cells; should use BLANK
- **`ISBLANK` / `ISNOTBLANK`**: densifies; should use `ISDEFINED` / `IFDEFINED`
- **`[ADD: X][FILTER: ...]`**: densify-then-subset; use `IF(condition, value)`
- **`[FILTER: NOT ...]`**: use `[EXCLUDE: ...]`
- **Heavy `PREVIOUS` chains / multiple `PREVIOUS(...)` calls**: check if `CUMULATE`, `FILLFORWARD`, or `SELECT` fits
- **`IFBLANK(X, PREVIOUS(...))` or `IFBLANK(X, PREVIOUSOF(...))`**: use `FILLFORWARD`
- **`[ADD: X][REMOVE: X]` / `[REMOVE: X][ADD: Y]` round-trips**: use `BY` with mapping
- **Chained `[BY:][BY:]` on Transaction List**: drops properties; use single `BY` with comma-separated mappings
- **`[REMOVE: Version]`**: collapses scenario meaning; verify intentional
- **`REMOVE` in formulas**: scope loss; check with `tool:get_metric_dependencies`
- **2-arg `IF(cond, expr)` on 6+ dim metrics** with non-trivial second arg: use `expr[FILTER: cond]`
- **Hard-coded year / `DATE(YYYY, ...)`**: use Date-typed or Dimension-typed input metrics
- **Periods or colons in block names**: breaks formula references
- **Unresolved `Copy of X` default names**: leftover from duplication
- **Formula metrics with input overrides enabled**: audit risk if untracked

## HIGH -- Check Cycles and Versions

Use `tool:list_cycles` to check planning cycles. Use `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` with `kind: ["Dimension"]` and a name regex to verify a Version dimension exists. A missing Version dimension is a high-severity structural gap; see `skill:building-versions-and-planning-cycles` for fixes.

## HIGH -- Verify Calendar Coverage

Use `tool:calendar_get` to read the current configuration. Flag:

- Calendar end date before the next fiscal year (blocks future planning)
- Missing Quarter dimension when the app is FP&A-oriented
- Daily calendar with a large range (performance risk for iterative formulas)

For fixes, see `skill:setting-up-calendar`.

## MEDIUM -- Review Scenario Governance

Use `tool:list_scenarios`. Flag:

- Duplicate or near-duplicate names (case differences like `Budget` vs `budget`)
- Non-descriptive names (`child`, `test`, `scenario1`)
- Total count above 5-6 in a non-enterprise app (each scenario increases recalculation cost)
- Scenarios with formula errors (cross-reference with formula health findings)

## MEDIUM -- Audit Library and Shared Content

Use `tool:list_application_libraries`. Flag:

- Libraries enabled but providing no actively used blocks
- Old or versioned library names (e.g. `FY24` library on an `FY25` app)
- Excessive shared surface exposing internal blocks
- Shared metrics consumed locally but not through the library mechanism (direct cross-app references instead of PULL/PUSH)

## MEDIUM -- Check Modeling Governance

Use `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` and `tool:get_metric_dependencies` to identify structural debt:

- **Repeated logic across metrics**: Same subexpression duplicated in multiple formulas instead of centralized in a shared intermediary metric
- **Multi-purpose metrics**: A single metric doing aggregation, filtering, and business logic; should be split into focused layers
- **Hidden-metric access gaps**: Metrics with AR Apply rules that reference dimensions not in the metric's own structure, or metrics consuming AR-protected data without their own AR coverage
- **Access rights enforced only via Board visibility**: Data is hidden on boards but has no AR metric backing it; users with Block Explorer access can see everything. See `skill:securing-with-access-rights`

## LOW -- Inspect Naming Hygiene

Use `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` with `friendly_name_regex_search` to find blocks matching test/copy/temporary patterns:

- **`copy`, `Copy`, `COPY`**: Leftover duplicates
- **`test`, `Test`, `TEST`**: Experimental blocks not cleaned up
- **`new metric`, `New Metric`, `NewBlock`**: Default names never renamed
- **`tmp`, `TMP`, `ZZ`, `TBD`**: Explicitly temporary blocks
- **Hex-dash sequences (UUID-like)**: Auto-generated names

Count them, note their folder, flag as cleanup candidates.

## LOW -- Find Unused Blocks

Use `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` with `kind: ["Metric"]` to page through all metrics, then `tool:get_metric_dependencies` on each to find orphans (zero usages). Batch dependency checks in parallel.

**Safe to delete**: no formula references, no views, no boards, no automations, no ARM. **Not safe**: displayed on a board/view, shared via library (other apps may consume), input metrics with user data, metrics with overrides, or settings/parameters folder items. Always present the list to the user before deleting; group by folder; highlight input and shared metrics separately.

## LOW -- Check Folder Organization

Use `tool:search_metrics_and_lists` with `parent_folder_regex_search: ["^/$"]` or an empty-path filter to identify blocks in root / no folder. Check whether a standard folder structure exists (numbered prefixes like `0. Settings`, `1. Dimensions`). Mixed-purpose or flat layouts are a maintenance risk. For fixes, see `skill:naming-and-organizing-applications`.

## LOW -- Evaluate Board Quality

Use `tool:search_boards` and `tool:get_board` for suspicious boards. Flag:

- Total board count above 20
- UUID-like or meaningless board names
- Duplicate boards (same or very similar names)
- Homepage action cards pointing to wrong destinations
- Boards with more than 20 widgets (load-time risk)

## Report Structure

1. **Executive summary**: 2-3 sentences on model health and top priorities
2. **Findings by severity**: CRITICAL (active errors) → HIGH (structural risks) → MEDIUM (governance debt) → LOW (cosmetic). Name specific blocks with `mention:` syntax.
3. **Remediation priority**: numbered list; errors first, then structural, then hygiene
4. **Next steps**: offer cleanup plan, fixes, or deeper performance analysis
