# Workforce Planning – Application Architecture & Patterns

## Purpose

This document is a **reusable pattern** for an employee-based workforce planning application. It describes the **layered metric architecture**, **dimension roles**, **data flows** (Existing Employees + To-Be-Hired), **override and validation patterns**, and **naming conventions** so another modeler can understand the design and replicate it in new applications.

**When to use this pattern**

- You are building or extending a **workforce planning** app that combines:
  - **Existing employees** (HRIS actuals, spread logic, cards, events, compensation)
  - **To-Be-Hired (TBH)** (request list, FTE/salary/dates, validation, stats, compensation)
  - **Consolidated workforce** (headcount, FTE, transfers, comp at Workforce × Dept × Entity × Version × Month)
  - **Overrides** (Changelog → override metrics → staging)
  - **Governance** (validation status, version close, access rights, merit cycles)
  - **Financial alignment** (PnL/BS mapping, FX, merit and tax assumptions)

**When not to use**

- Purely headcount-only models with no compensation or TBH may not need the full layering (e.g. Comp layer, TBH flow).
- Applications that do not use version/scenario dimensions or validation workflows will not need the full scenario and governance patterns described here.

---

## 1. Business scope (summary)

The application covers **end-to-end workforce planning**:

- **Master data:** Entities, departments, job positions, chart of accounts (PnL, BS).
- **Existing employees:** HRIS import → staging (with spread and history/plan logic) → overrides (Changelog) → cards → events (hires, terms, transfers) → stats at Employee then Workforce.
- **To-Be-Hired:** TBH request list with FTE, salary, hire/term date, job position → validation → TBH stats (headcount, FTE, terminations) → mapping to Workforce.
- **Total workforce:** Consolidated **Workforce Cards** (entity, department, currency, etc.) and stats at **Version × Month × Workforce**; reporting by Dept × Entity (and other axes) via **mapped dimensions** (BY: -> `WF_Card_*`), not by adding those dimensions to every metric. See **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions**.
- **Compensation:** Salary, bonus, benefits, taxes for EE and TBH; merit and tax assumptions; mapping to PnL/BS; FX conversion for multi-currency.
- **Scenario & security:** Version dimension (windows, close date), Data Type (Actual/Budget/Forecast), validation dimensions, access rights (ARM/ARC) for edit and approval.

## 2. Core concepts (generalized)

| Concept                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Layered metric architecture**         | Clear separation: **Data** (load/staging) → **Card** (canonical attributes per entity/month) → **Stats** (events: hires, terms, transfers) → **Comp** (salary, bonus, benefits, taxes) → **Push/KPI** (export, counts) and **Security** (ARM/ARC). Each layer consumes the layer below; no skipping.                                                                                                |
| **Two populations**                     | **Existing Employees (EE):** from HRIS (and spread logic) + Changelog overrides. **To-Be-Hired (TBH):** from a request/list with inputs (FTE, dates, salary). Both feed **Workforce**-level cards and stats.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Data → Card → Stats**                 | **Data** resolves raw sources (HRIS, TBH list) to a consistent grain (e.g. Version × Entity × Month). **Card** fixes attributes at a single “planning load” reference (e.g. one snapshot month per version/month). **Stats** derive **events** by comparing cards across months (e.g. entity or department change = transfer).                                                                      |
| **Override-first staging**              | For EE, staging metrics use IFDEFINED(Override, Override, HRIS_logic). Overrides come from Changelog projection (see skill “Changelog to Override Metrics”). Cards and stats only see the post-override view.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Validation dimension**                | A dimension (e.g. Validation Status: Draft/Submitted/Approved/Rejected) tags rows or versions. Plan metrics and KPIs filter to Approved only; access rights control who can change status.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Version & scenario dimensions**       | **Version** (or equivalent) holds window start/end, close date, last actuals month. **Data Type** (Actual/Budget/Forecast) can drive FX or display. Metrics and access rights respect version close and windows.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Workforce Cards & mapped dimensions** | The **4.0 layer** unifies EE + TBH at Version × Month × **Workforce**. `WF_Card_*` metrics hold each Workforce item’s attributes (Entity, Department, Currency). Core stats/comp stay at **Workforce** only; breakdowns (Dept × Entity, PnL push) use **BY: -> `WF_Card_*`** so Entity/Department are **mapped**, not structural. See **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions**. |
| **Naming conventions**                  | **Prefix by domain:** `EE_` (existing employee), `TBH_` (to-be-hired), `WF_` (workforce total), `Asm_` (assumptions), `Push_` (export), `KPI_`, `ARM_`/`ARC_` (access rights). **Suffix by layer:** `_Data`, `_Card`, `_Stats`, `_Comp`, `_Input`, `_Calc`, `_Req_`, `_Rep_`, `_View`.                                                                                                              |

## 3. Pipeline (end-to-end)

**Existing Employees**

```text
HRIS load list → Data layer (EE_Data_*: resolve by snapshot, history/plan toggle, override-first)
  → Spread logic (effective snapshot month, FILLFORWARD dates, version window)
  → Override metrics (EEO_* from Changelog)
  → Card layer (EE_Card_*: canonical attributes at Version × Employee × Month)
  → Stats (EE_Stats_*: new hires, terminations, transfer in/out via card comparison)
  → Workforce aggregation (EE_Stats_* [BY: Employee.Workforce] → WF_Stats_*)
```

**To-Be-Hired**

```pigment
TBH request list + TBH_Req_Input_* → Validation status
  → TBH_Stats_* (headcount, FTE, terminations; PRORATA by hire/term; filter Approved, plan months; exclude hired)
  → Workforce mapping (TBH_Stats_* [BY: TBH Requests.Workforce] → WF_Card_*, WF_Stats_*)
```

**Consolidation & output (4.0 Workforce layer)**

```pigment
WF_Card_* (unified attributes at Version × Month × Workforce: EE_Card_* or TBH-side cards)
  → WF_Stats_* at Workforce only (EE_Stats_* [BY: Employee.Workforce] + TBH_Stats_* [BY: TBH Requests.Workforce])
  → Breakdowns via mapped dimensions: WF_Stats_Headcount [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity], etc.
  → WF_Comp_* → WF_Comp Plan Data → Push_* (map to Entity/Dept/PnL via cards)
  → KPI_* (export, filled TBH count, changelog count)
```

See **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions** for why core metrics stay at Workforce and how mapping works.

**Governance throughout:** Validation Status = Approved; version close excluded; ARM/ARC for edit and approval; merit/tax assumptions and FX in dedicated layers.

## 4. Folder structure (generic)

A typical ordering that supports the pipeline:

| Folder / area                     | Role                               | Typical content                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Existing Employee Planning**    | EE cards and events                | `EE_Card_*`; `EE_Stats_*` (new hires, terminations, transfers).                                                                                                                     |
| **TBH Planning**                  | TBH inputs and stats               | `TBH_Req_Input_*`, `TBH_Req_Calc_*` (validation, TBH ID); `TBH_Stats_*`; `TBH_Comp_*`.                                                                                              |
| **Total Workforce**               | Consolidation                      | `WF_Card_*`; `WF_Stats_*`; `WF_Comp_*`; WF_Comp Plan Data.                                                                                                                          |

## 5. Metric layers (patterns)

### 5.1 Data layer (`EE_Data_*`, resolution to Version × Employee × Month)

**Role:** Resolve HRIS (and spread) to planning grain; apply history vs plan; apply override-first.

**Pattern (schematic):**

```text
IF(Populate_History?,
  Source_list.'Attribute'
    [BY LASTNONBLANK: Entity_Mapping, Snapshot_Date]
    [ADD: Version][FILTER: Is_Actual]
    [BY CONSTANT: Spd_Effective_Snapshot_History],
  Source_list.'Attribute'
    [BY LASTNONBLANK: Entity_Mapping, Snapshot_Date]
    [ADD: Version][FILTER: Is_Actual]
    [BY CONSTANT: Spd_Effective_Snapshot_Plan]
)
```

Override-first is applied when the attribute can be overridden: IFDEFINED(`EEO_*`, `EEO_*`, <above>). See “Snapshot Spread Logic” and “Changelog to Override Metrics” skills.

### 5.2 Card layer (`EE_Card_*`, `WF_Card_*`)

**Role:** Canonical attributes at Version × Entity × Month (EE) or **Version × Month × Workforce** (WF). EE cards fix to one “planning load” snapshot; WF cards unify EE + TBH so every Workforce item has Entity, Department, Currency, etc. without adding those dimensions to core metrics.

**Pattern (EE):** Card_Attribute = Data_Attribute [BY CONSTANT: Spd_Effective_Snapshot_Month].

**Pattern (WF):** WF_Card_Attribute = IFDEFINED(EE_Card_Attribute[BY CONSTANT: Workforce.Employee], same, WF_Card_Attribute_TBH). TBH-side cards use TBH_Stats_FTE or list properties mapped via Workforce.TBH. **Breakdowns** (e.g. headcount by Dept × Entity) use core metric [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity]. Full pattern: **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions**.

### 5.3 Stats layer (`EE_Stats_*`, `TBH_Stats_*`, `WF_Stats_*`)

**Role:** **Events** (new hire, termination, transfer in/out) and **levels** (headcount, FTE).

**EE events (schematic):** Compare cards across months. Example transfer out:

```text
IF(
  (EE_Card_Entity <> EE_Card_Entity[SELECT: Month + 1]) OR
  (EE_Card_Department <> EE_Card_Department[SELECT: Month + 1]),
  -1
)
```

New hire / termination: presence in current month but not previous (or reverse). Use +1/-1 flags then aggregate at Workforce.

**TBH stats:** `PRORATA(Month, STARTOFMONTH(Hire Date), STARTOFMONTH(Term Date + 1)) * ROUNDUP(FTE, 0) [Set_Plan Month View] [BY: Validation Status → Approved]`. Exclude rows already linked to a hired employee.

**WF stats:** `EE_Stats_… [BY: Employee.Workforce] [FILTER: Validation Status = Approved] + TBH_Stats_… [BY: TBH Requests.Workforce]`. Keep `WF_Stats_…` at **Workforce** only. Breakdowns: `WF_Stats_Headcount_Dep_Entity = WF_Stats_Headcount [BY: -> WF_Card_Department, WF_Card_Entity]` (mapped dimensions). See **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions**.

### 5.4 Comp layer (`WF_Comp_*`, `TBH_Comp_*`)

**Role:** Salary, bonus, benefits, taxes by Workforce (or TBH) × Version × Month; apply merit and tax assumptions; map to PnL/BS.

**Pattern (PnL export):** `(WF_Comp_01_Salary[BY: PnL_Account."6001"] + WF_Comp_01_Bonus[BY: PnL_Account."6002"] + …) [SELECT: Validation Status."Approved"] [Push_DH_View_Load Plan]`.

### 5.5 KPI & Security layers

**KPI:** Counts (e.g. filled TBH per Dept/Entity; pending changelog per Employee). IFDEFINED(…) or IFBLANK(Changelog[BY: …][FILTER: …][REMOVE COUNT: Changelog], 0).

**Security:** `ARM_*` (read/write by User, optionally Department/Entity). `ARC_*` (input flags for approval). `MAP_*` (e.g. merit cycle: editable only when cycle month matches and version not closed). ACCESSRIGHTS(TRUE, TRUE) / ACCESSRIGHTS(TRUE, BLANK) with IF(Admin, …, IF(ARC_Input, …, BLANK)).

---

## 6. Dimension framework

- **Structural:** Entity, Department, Workforce, Employee, Job Position, Grade, State, Country. Used for org and reporting axes.
- **Scenario:** Version (window start/end, close date, last actuals month), Data Type (Actual/Budget/Forecast). Version drives which months are calculated and whether a version is frozen.
- **Time:** Month, Quarter, Month of Year, Quarter of Year. Properties: Start Date, End Date, mapping to Year.
- **Financial:** PnL_Account, PnL_Account Category, BS_Account, BS_Account Class/Category. Operator for sign. Currency, FX Rate Types, Reporting Currency.
- **Validation / workflow:** Validation Status (Draft/Submitted/Approved/Rejected). Used to filter plan metrics and KPIs and to drive access (who can approve).
- **Security:** User (Name, Email, ID). Access rights metrics by User (and optionally Department, Entity).

Metrics rarely use Pigment native Scenarios for business logic; Version and Data Type dimensions model scenarios; application-level Scenarios can be used for sandboxing.

---

## 7. Key modeling patterns

- **Driver-based events:** Derive hires, terms, transfers from **card comparison across months** (SELECT: Month + 1), not from manual event flags.
- **PRORATA for FTE:** Allocate FTE across months from hire to term using PRORATA(Month, STARTOFMONTH(Hire Date), STARTOFMONTH(Term Date + 1)); use TIMEDIM for date–period alignment.
- **Validation filtering:** All plan-facing metrics and exports filter to Validation Status = Approved (and exclude after version close where relevant).
- **Override-first:** Staging = IFDEFINED(Override, Override, Source). Cards and stats never implement override logic; they consume staging.
- **Access rights by cycle/version:** Merit (or similar) inputs editable only when (e.g.) Month of Year matches merit cycle and Version has no Close Date. Use `MAP_*` metrics with EXCLUDE/ADD to scope ACCESSRIGHTS.
- **Workforce Cards & mapped dimensions:** Keep core stats/comp at **Workforce** (plus Version, Month, Validation). Attach Entity, Department, Currency via `WF_Card_*`. Report by Dept × Entity (or PnL, etc.) with **BY: -> `WF_Card_*`** so those axes are mapped, not structural. See **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions**.
- **Naming:** Prefix by domain (`EE_`, `TBH_`, `WF_`, `Asm_`, `Push_`, `KPI_`, `ARM_`/`ARC_`); suffix by layer (`_Data`, `_Card`, `_Stats`, `_Comp`, `_Input`, `_Calc`, `_Req_`, `_Rep_`, `_View`). Folder order: Admin/Dimensions → Data → EE Planning → TBH Planning → Total Workforce → KPI → Security → Boards.

---

## 8. How to apply this pattern elsewhere

1. **Replicate the layered folder structure:** Data → Cards → Stats → Comp → Push/KPI → Security; keep Admin/Dimensions and Calendar/FX at the top.
2. **Define dimension roles clearly:** Structural (org, workforce), scenario (Version, Data Type), time (Month, Quarter), financial (PnL/BS, Currency), validation, User.
3. **Model events from cards:** Use card comparison (SELECT: Month + 1) for transfers and presence for hires/terms; avoid ad-hoc event flags.
4. **Isolate assumptions:** Keep user inputs in `Asm_*` or `_Input_*` metrics and dedicated lists; reference them in Comp and driver logic.
5. **Use validation and access rights:** Validation Status dimension; filter to Approved in plan metrics; ARM/ARC for edit and approval; version close and cycle-based access (`MAP_*`).
6. **Implement the 4.0 Workforce layer:** Unify EE + TBH in a Workforce dimension; build `WF_Card_*` for attributes; keep `WF_Stats_*` and `WF_Comp_*` at Workforce only; use BY: -> `WF_Card_*` for breakdowns (mapped dimensions). See **Workforce Planning – Workforce Cards & Mapped Dimensions**.
7. **Adopt the naming conventions:** Prefix by domain, suffix by layer; consistent folder ordering.

---

## 9. Pitfalls and reminders

- **Do not skip layers.** Every layer builds on the one below (Data → Card → Stats → Comp → Push/KPI). Jumping from Data directly to Stats bypasses overrides and card canonicalization.
- **Override-first belongs in staging only.** Cards and stats consume staging; they never reference Changelog or override metrics directly.
- **Keep WF_Stats and WF_Comp at Workforce only.** Use `BY: -> WF_Card_*` for breakdowns (mapped dimensions); do not add Entity or Department as structural dimensions to core metrics.
- **Naming discipline.** Consistent prefixes (`EE_`, `TBH_`, `WF_`, `Asm_`, `Push_`, `KPI_`, `ARM_`/`ARC_`) and suffixes (`_Data`, `_Card`, `_Stats`, `_Comp`) prevent confusion as the model grows.
- **Version close.** Ensure all relevant metrics and access rights respect version close; a single missing filter can allow edits on a frozen version.

## 10. Illustration: Workforce Planning Template

In the Pigment [FIN]02 Workforce Planning – Employee based application, the pattern above is implemented as follows (names are template-specific).

**Folders:** 0. Admin (Dimensions, Library); 01. Actual + Plan View Management; 02. FX Currency Conversion; Calendar; 10. Business Dimensions; 11. Chart of Accounts; 1.
