description: Discover and list a site's URLs, with search filtering. Use for "map the site" or "find the URL for" requests — when the user knows the site but not the exact page, or wants site structure.

# firecrawl map

Discover URLs on a site. Use `--search` to find a specific page within a large site.

**Prerequisite:** `map` requires authentication (no keyless free tier); without credentials the CLI prompts an interactive login.

## Quick start

```bash
# Find a specific page on a large site
firecrawl map "<url>" --search "authentication" -o .firecrawl/filtered.txt

# Get all URLs
firecrawl map "<url>" --limit 500 --json -o .firecrawl/urls.json
```

Run `firecrawl map --help` for the full option list (sitemap handling, subdomains, etc.).

**Done when:** the URL list is saved under `.firecrawl/` and you have selected the URLs to scrape or crawl next.

## Tips

- **Map + scrape is a common pattern**: use `map --search` to find the right URL, then `scrape` it.
- Example: `map https://docs.example.com --search "auth"` → found `/docs/api/authentication` → `scrape` that URL.
