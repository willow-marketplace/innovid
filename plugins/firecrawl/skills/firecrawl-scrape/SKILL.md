# firecrawl scrape

Scrape one or more URLs. Returns clean, LLM-optimized markdown. Multiple URLs are scraped concurrently.

## Quick start

```bash
# Basic markdown extraction
firecrawl scrape "<url>" -o .firecrawl/page.md

# Main content only, no nav/footer
firecrawl scrape "<url>" --only-main-content -o .firecrawl/page.md

# Wait for JS to render, then scrape
firecrawl scrape "<url>" --wait-for 3000 -o .firecrawl/page.md

# Multiple URLs (markdown only; each saved to .firecrawl/; -o is ignored)
firecrawl scrape https://example.com https://example.com/blog https://example.com/docs

# Get markdown and links together
firecrawl scrape "<url>" --format markdown,links -o .firecrawl/page.json

# Ask a question about the page
firecrawl scrape "https://example.com/pricing" --query "What is the enterprise plan price?"
```

Run `firecrawl scrape --help` for the full option list.

**Done when:** you have the scraped content — on stdout, in your `-o` file, or under `.firecrawl/` for multi-URL scrapes — and have inspected it with bounded reads (`head`, `grep`) to answer the request.

## Tips

- **Prefer plain scrape over `--query`.** Scrape to a file, then use `grep`, `head`, or read the markdown directly — you can search and reason over the full content yourself. Use `--query` only when you want a single targeted answer without saving the page (costs 5 extra credits).
- **Scrape handles static pages and JS-rendered SPAs.** Escalate to `interact` when the page needs interaction (clicks, form fills, pagination) or scrape misses content.
- Multiple URLs are scraped concurrently — check `firecrawl --status` for your concurrency limit. This mode saves markdown only and ignores `-o`; other requested formats are dropped. If markdown wasn't requested, the whole JSON response is written into the `.md` file.
- Single format outputs raw content. Multiple formats (e.g., `--format markdown,links`) output JSON.
- Always quote URLs — shell interprets `?` and `&` as special characters.
- Naming convention: `.firecrawl/{site}-{path}.md`
