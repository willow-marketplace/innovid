description: 'Control and interact with a live browser session on any scraped page — click buttons, fill forms, navigate flows, and extract data using natural language prompts or code. Use when the user needs to interact with a webpage beyond simple scraping: logging into a site, submitting forms, clicking through pagination, handling infinite scroll, navigating multi-step checkout or wizard flows, or when a regular scrape failed because content is behind JavaScript interaction. Also useful for authenticated scraping via profiles. Triggers on "interact", "click", "fill out the form", "log in to", "sign in", "submit", "paginated", "next page", "infinite scroll", "interact with the page", "navigate to", "open a session", or "scrape failed".'

# firecrawl interact

Interact with scraped pages in a live browser session. Scrape a page first, then use natural language prompts or code to click, fill forms, navigate, and extract data.

## When to use

- Content requires interaction: clicks, form fills, pagination, login
- `scrape` failed because content is behind JavaScript interaction
- You need to navigate a multi-step flow
- Last resort in the [workflow escalation pattern](../firecrawl/SKILL.md): search → scrape → map + scrape → crawl → monitor → **interact**
- **Never use interact for web searches** — use `search` instead

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Scrape a page (scrape ID is saved automatically)
firecrawl scrape "<url>"

# 2. Interact with the page using a positional prompt
firecrawl interact "Click the login button"
firecrawl interact "Fill in the email field with test@example.com"
firecrawl interact "Extract the pricing table"

# A UUID first argument is auto-detected as the scrape ID
firecrawl interact "<scrape-id>" "Extract the pricing table"

# 3. Or use code for precise control
firecrawl interact --code "agent-browser click @e5" --bash
firecrawl interact --code "agent-browser snapshot -i" --bash

# 4. Stop the session when done
firecrawl interact stop
```

## Options

| Option                           | Description                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `--prompt <text>`                | Natural language instruction (use this OR --code) |
| `--code <code>`                  | Code to execute in the browser session            |
| `--node` / `--python` / `--bash` | Language for `--code` (default: node)             |
| `--timeout <seconds>`            | Execution timeout (default: 30, max: 300)         |
| `--scrape-id <id>`               | Target a specific scrape (default: last scrape)   |
| `-o, --output <path>`            | Output file path                                  |

## Profiles

Use `--profile` on the scrape to persist browser state (cookies, localStorage) across scrapes:

```bash
# Session 1: Login and save state
firecrawl scrape "https://app.example.com/login" --profile my-app
firecrawl interact --prompt "Fill in email with user@example.com and click login"

# Session 2: Come back authenticated
firecrawl scrape "https://app.example.com/dashboard" --profile my-app
firecrawl interact --prompt "Extract the dashboard data"
```

Read-only reconnect (no writes to profile state):

```bash
firecrawl scrape "https://app.example.com" --profile my-app --no-save-changes
```

## Tips

- Always scrape first — `interact` requires a scrape ID from a previous `firecrawl scrape` call
- The scrape ID is saved automatically, so you don't need `--scrape-id` for subsequent interact calls. Saved sessions may expire after about 10 minutes; re-scrape if the CLI warns that the session is stale
- Use `firecrawl interact stop` to free resources when done
- For parallel work, scrape multiple pages and interact with each using `--scrape-id`
