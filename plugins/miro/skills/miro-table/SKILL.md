# Miro Table

Shortcut to the Miro MCP table tools.

Explore the table tools exposed by the Miro MCP server and use them according
to their tool descriptions and parameter schemas. The MCP server is the source
of truth for supported column types and option shape, which tool to pick, the
order in which tools must be called, and all placement parameters.

## Workflow

1. Identify the **board URL**. If missing, ask.
2. Identify **what table the user wants** (title and columns, or a topic to
   propose a column set from). Ask if unclear.
3. Pick the appropriate table tool from the Miro MCP server and call it
   according to its description and parameter schema.

## When not to use this skill

If the user wants a brand-new, standalone table — not added onto a board
they're already working on — use the miro-format skill instead. It creates
the table as its own content item rather than as a widget.
