# Agent Skills for the Scandit SDK

AI agent skills for integrating the [Scandit Data Capture SDK](https://docs.scandit.com).

Each skill is specific to a product and a framework (e.g. SparkScan iOS), and bundles the recommended integration code, up-to-date setup, permissions and license-key wiring, common customization recipes (modes, callbacks, UI tweaks), and migration guidance, SDK version upgrades and, for some products, replacing a third-party scanner, all grounded in Scandit's own documentation. Install once, then just ask your agent for the feature instead of pasting docs snippets into your AI editor.

## Installation

Install the plugin. One command, and your agent gets all 74 skills:

```bash
npx plugins add scandit/skills
```

It detects which coding agents you have and installs into each of them. Re-run the same command to pull the latest skills.

Or install from your agent's own marketplace:

| Agent | Install | Updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex / ChatGPT App | [One click install](https://chatgpt.com/plugins/plugins_6a6c6b6440a08191987ecc241e8660f7), or search **Scandit SDK** in the [plugin directory](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins?surface=app#plugin-directory-in-the-codex-app) | Automatic |
| Claude Code | `/plugin marketplace add scandit/skills`<br>`/plugin install scandit-sdk@scandit-plugins` | `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** → `scandit-plugins` → **Enable auto-update** |
| Cursor | [One click install](https://cursor.com/marketplace/scandit), or `/add-plugin scandit-sdk` in the editor | Automatic |
| Codex CLI | `codex plugin marketplace add scandit/skills`<br>`codex plugin add scandit-sdk@scandit-plugins` | `codex plugin marketplace upgrade scandit-plugins` |
| Copilot CLI | `copilot plugin marketplace add scandit/skills`<br>`copilot plugin install scandit-sdk@scandit-plugins` | `copilot plugin update scandit-sdk` |
| Everyone else | `npx skills add scandit/skills` | `npx skills update scandit/skills` |

**Just one skill?** Your agent only loads the skills your prompt needs, so the full bundle is usually the right choice. To install a single one, name it: for SparkScan Web, use

```bash
npx skills add scandit/skills --skill sparkscan-web
```

## How to use it

Describe what you want in plain language. Your agent loads the right skill on its own, or you can call one explicitly with `/skill-name` followed by your task.

**Not sure which Scandit product you need?** Start with `data-capture-sdk`. It is an advisor, not an integration skill: it asks a few questions about your workflow, recommends the right product, then hands off to the matching implementation skill for your platform. Describe your app, paste a screenshot of the screen you want to add scanning to, or drop in a photo of the label, package or ID you need to capture.

```
/data-capture-sdk I need to scan barcodes in a warehouse picking app - which Scandit product should I use?
/data-capture-sdk here is a photo of the labels we want to capture - what fits best?
```

**Already know the product?** Go straight to its skill.

```
/sparkscan-ios add a barcode scanner to the home screen of my app
/label-capture-web capture the expiry date and lot number from these pharmacy labels
```

**Migrating?** Most implementation skills carry version migration guidance alongside first integration. The Barcode Capture, SparkScan and MatrixScan Batch skills add a guide for replacing a third-party scanner.

```
/barcode-capture-android migrate this app from the Scandit SDK v6 API to v8
/matrixscan-batch-web we use BarcodeTracking, move us to BarcodeBatch
/sparkscan-android replace our current third-party barcode scanner with SparkScan
```

| `scandit-xamarin-to-net-migration` | Migrate the **Scandit SDK integration** after a Xamarin app has already been moved onto the supported .NET stack — .NET for Android, .NET for iOS, or .NET MAUI (e.g. after Microsoft's .NET app-modernization tooling; Xamarin support ended May 2024). A post-migration, Scandit-only companion: it swaps `Scandit.DataCapture.*.Xamarin(.Forms)` packages for their .NET/`*.Maui` equivalents, fixes SDK-8 init, the `.Unified` namespaces and views, verifies scanning, and hands off to the matching `*-net-android` / `*-net-ios` / `*-net-maui` skill. The general app migration stays with Microsoft's tooling (the GitHub Copilot app-modernization agent, successor to the deprecated .NET Upgrade Assistant). Produces a Scandit migration report. |
