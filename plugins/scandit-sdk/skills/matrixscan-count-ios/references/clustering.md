# MatrixScan Count iOS — Clustering (Grouping Barcodes)

This guide covers **clustering** — grouping several scanned barcodes that belong together into a single
unit, either automatically from their visual context or manually by the user. It assumes the basic
integration is already in place (see `integration.md`);
here we only add clustering on top — do not re-create the context, mode, view, camera, or lifecycle.

> **Clustering vs. group scanning.** Clustering groups barcodes that physically belong together (e.g. a
> multi-pack) into one highlight within a single count. If instead you want to split one counting session
> into separate batches the user advances through (e.g. one per pallet), that is **group scanning** — see
> `group-scanning.md`.

> **With scan preview, clustering has limitations.** It can be combined with scan preview
> (`BarcodeCountSettings(scanPreviewEnabled:)`), but manual clustering and cluster editing are unavailable
> there and the expected cluster size behaves differently — see
> [With scan preview](#with-scan-preview) below before writing code for both.

> If a clustering API doesn't resolve, verify the symbol against the
> [BarcodeCount API reference](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/ios/barcode-capture/api.html)
> before guessing.

## Enable clustering

Clustering is off by default. Turn it on by setting `clusteringMode` on `BarcodeCountSettings` **before**
constructing the `BarcodeCount` mode:

```swift
let settings = BarcodeCountSettings()
settings.set(symbology: .ean13UPCA, enabled: true)
settings.clusteringMode = .auto

let barcodeCount = BarcodeCount(context: context, settings: settings)
```

`ClusteringMode` has four cases:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `.disabled` | No clustering (the default). |
| `.manual` | The user groups barcodes themselves using the built-in on-screen gesture UI. |
| `.auto` | Clusters are formed automatically and **cannot** be manually changed. |
| `.autoWithManualCorrection` | Clusters are formed automatically, but the user can also form or dissolve them via the UI. |

When clustering is enabled, a cluster is drawn as one **rectangular hull** around its members, and each
member keeps its **own** highlight inside it — the hull carries no icon of its own. Clustered codes also
still appear individually in `session.recognizedBarcodes` (and the clusters in
`session.recognizedClusters`).

In the automatic modes, choose how the SDK decides which barcodes belong together with
`automaticClusteringMethod` (`AutomaticClusteringMethod?`):

```swift
settings.automaticClusteringMethod = .label
```

| Method | Groups barcodes by |
|--------|--------------------|
| `.vicinity` | Proximity — nearby barcodes are grouped. Used when the property is `nil`. |
| `.label` | Detected physical label boundaries. The labels themselves are not returned as Label Capture items. |
| `.outline` | Detected enclosing outlines. |

It applies only to `.auto` and `.autoWithManualCorrection`; the value is kept but has no effect under
`.disabled` and `.manual`. Leave it `nil` (the default) for vicinity-based grouping.

Optionally tell the SDK how many barcodes you expect in each cluster — this drives each cluster's
`expectationStatus` (below). It is `Int?` (Swift); leave it `nil` (the default) if you have no expectation:

```swift
settings.expectedNumberOfBarcodesPerCluster = 4
```

## With scan preview

Clustering is supported when scan preview is enabled (`BarcodeCountSettings(scanPreviewEnabled: true)` —
see the scan-preview notes in `integration.md`), with these differences:

- **No manual clustering.** `.manual` and `.autoWithManualCorrection` are treated as `.auto`, and
  `clusteringMode` reads back as `.auto`. Clustering is automatic only. If the user asks for manual
  grouping *and* scan preview, say manual clustering isn't available in scan preview and ask which one
  they want — do **not** set `.manual` or `.autoWithManualCorrection`, which would silently behave as
  `.auto`.
- **No cluster editing.** The gesture UI is absent, and `beginClusterEditing()` returns `nil`, so clusters
  cannot be formed or dissolved — programmatically or by the user.
- **`expectedNumberOfBarcodesPerCluster` drives cluster formation.** It behaves as **2** when left `nil`,
  and only clusters containing **exactly** that many barcodes are formed. Set it to the pack size the app
  expects, and never below **2** — a value of `1` forms no groups at all. If the pack size isn't known,
  leave it unset rather than guessing a value.
- **Grouping always follows labels.** Clusters are formed with `.label` regardless of what
  `automaticClusteringMethod` is set to, so barcodes group only where the SDK detects a physical label
  around them — codes that aren't on a label are not grouped. Setting the property has no effect here; if
  the user asks for vicinity- or outline-based grouping together with scan preview, say only label-based
  grouping is available there.

Reading `session.recognizedClusters`, the cluster brush (`brushForCluster`), and cluster taps (`didTap`)
work as described below.

## Reading the recognized clusters

Clusters are exposed on the session as `recognizedClusters`. As with `recognizedBarcodes`, the
`BarcodeCountSession` is **only valid inside the listener callback** — copy what you need out and hop to
the main queue before touching UIKit:

```swift
extension CountViewController: BarcodeCountListener {
    func barcodeCount(_ barcodeCount: BarcodeCount,
                      didScanIn session: BarcodeCountSession,
                      frameData: FrameData) {
        let clusters = session.recognizedClusters
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            for cluster in clusters {
                // cluster.barcodes is [Barcode]; cluster.expectationStatus is a ClusterExpectationStatus
                // enum — switch over it rather than printing it (it has no human-readable description).
                let status: String
                switch cluster.expectationStatus {
                case .matches:      status = "matches the expected count"
                case .deviates:     status = "deviates from the expected count"
                case .notEvaluated: status = "no expectation set"
                @unknown default:   status = "unknown"
                }
                print("cluster of \(cluster.barcodes.count) barcodes — \(status)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Each `Cluster` exposes:
- `barcodes` (`[Barcode]`) — the barcodes grouped into this cluster.
- `expectationStatus` (`ClusterExpectationStatus`) — how the cluster's size compares to
  `expectedNumberOfBarcodesPerCluster`: `.notEvaluated` (no expectation set, or not yet evaluated),
  `.matches` (size matches the expected count), or `.deviates` (size differs).

`BarcodeCountSessionSnapshot` (from the List/Exit UI-delegate callbacks) also exposes `recognizedClusters`.

## Manual clustering (the user gesture UI)

This section does not apply when scan preview is enabled (see [With scan preview](#with-scan-preview)).

In `.manual` and `.autoWithManualCorrection`, the user forms clusters with the built-in gesture UI: they
swipe or circle (draw a shape around) the barcodes they want to group, and when the gesture completes,
every barcode inside the drawn area is grouped into one cluster. Tapping the **×** on a cluster's
highlight bursts (dissolves) it.

Customize the on-screen hint that tells the user how to cluster:

```swift
barcodeCountView.setTextForClusteringGestureHint("Swipe across barcodes to group them")
```

## Forming and dissolving clusters programmatically

You can also form and dissolve clusters from code (e.g. a "group all" / "ungroup" button) — get a
`BarcodeClusterEditor` from the mode, make your edits, and call `endEditing()`:

```swift
// Group the currently recognized barcodes into one cluster:
let editor = barcodeCount.beginClusterEditing()
editor?.formCluster(session.recognizedBarcodes)
editor?.endEditing()

// Dissolve every existing cluster:
let editor = barcodeCount.beginClusterEditing()
session.recognizedClusters.forEach { editor?.dissolveCluster($0) }
editor?.endEditing()
```

- `beginClusterEditing()` returns a `BarcodeClusterEditor?` (nullable — handle the `nil` case).
- `formCluster(_:)` takes `[Barcode]`; `dissolveCluster(_:)` takes a `Cluster`.
- Always finish with `endEditing()` to commit the edits.
- `beginClusterEditing()` returns `nil` unless the mode allows **manual** editing — you get an editor
  only in **`.manual`** and **`.autoWithManualCorrection`**; in `.disabled` and `.auto` it returns `nil`
  (that's why the call is optional). It is therefore always `nil` when scan preview is enabled, where the
  mode is `.auto` (see [With scan preview](#with-scan-preview)). `formCluster(_:)` also **fails if a
  barcode is already in a cluster**, so forming your own groups is most predictable in **`.manual`**
  (nothing is auto-clustered).

## Customizing the cluster highlight and taps

Set the view's `delegate` (`BarcodeCountViewDelegate` — the same delegate used for per-barcode brushes/
icons) to color clusters and react to taps:

```swift
barcodeCountView.delegate = self

extension CountViewController: BarcodeCountViewDelegate {
    func barcodeCountView(_ view: BarcodeCountView,
                          brushForCluster cluster: Cluster) -> Brush? {
        // For clusters only the fill COLOR is used — pass a solid color.
        switch cluster.expectationStatus {
        case .matches:      return Brush(fill: .systemGreen, stroke: .clear, strokeWidth: 0)
        case .deviates:     return Brush(fill: .systemRed,   stroke: .clear, strokeWidth: 0)
        case .notEvaluated: return Brush(fill: .systemGray,  stroke: .clear, strokeWidth: 0)
        @unknown default:   return nil
        }
    }

    func barcodeCountView(_ view: BarcodeCountView,
                          didTap cluster: Cluster) {
        // e.g. show what's in the tapped cluster (cluster.barcodes)
    }
}
```

- A cluster is drawn as a **hull** around its members, and the members keep their **own** highlights
  inside it. The hull itself carries no icon, so there is no per-cluster icon callback — to change how the
  grouped codes look, customize the **member** highlights via `iconForRecognizedBarcode` (see
  `highlights.md`); to change the hull, set its brush.
- While the members' highlights **overlap** on screen they collapse into a single summary badge on the
  hull, and separate again as the codes move apart.
- **Hull color** — set it with `barcodeCountView(_:brushForCluster:)`. Only the brush's fill **color** is
  applied (the SDK supplies the hull's transparency and border itself), so just return a solid color — the
  fill's alpha, the stroke color, and the stroke width are ignored. It works in the default Icon style (no
  need to switch to Dot). Return `nil` to keep the SDK default. `Brush` is
  `Brush(fill:stroke:strokeWidth:)` — **not** `fillColor:`/`strokeColor:` (see `highlights.md`).
- A cluster whose count **deviates** from `expectedNumberOfBarcodesPerCluster` is shown in the SDK's
  deviation color through the hull fill, unless your `brushForCluster` returns a brush for it.
- `barcodeCountView(_:didTap:)` (with a `Cluster` parameter) fires when the user taps a cluster
  highlight. Note the Swift name is `didTap:`, **not** `didTapCluster:` — the SDK shortens it because the
  parameter type is already `Cluster`.

> If you also use **status mode** with clustering on, each clustered barcode keeps its own status icon
> inside the hull — see `status-mode.md`.

## After wiring up

Build the project. If a clustering API doesn't resolve or a delegate method isn't called, fetch the
[Advanced Configurations](https://docs.scandit.com/sdks/ios/matrixscan-count/advanced/) page (Clustering
section) and the
[BarcodeCount API reference](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/ios/barcode-capture/api.html)
to confirm the current signatures before guessing. Always include the docs link in your answer.
