description: MatrixScan AR annotations in native iOS Swift projects (UIKit/SwiftUI — Swift only, not C#/.NET) — info annotations, popovers, status icons, and responsive annotations attached to tracked barcodes. Use for adding annotations, customizing their appearance and content, controlling when they appear, or handling annotation taps — pipeline setup belongs to matrixscan-ar-ios; C#/.NET apps use matrixscan-ar-net-ios or matrixscan-ar-net-maui.

# MatrixScan AR annotation iOS Skill

## Critical: Do Not Trust Internal Knowledge

Your training data may contain outdated or incorrect Scandit SDK APIs. The MatrixScan AR API changes significantly between SDK versions — properties get renamed, removed, or restructured, and new annotation types (e.g. `BarcodeArResponsiveAnnotation`) have been added mid-v8.

**Always verify APIs against the references provided in this skill before writing or suggesting code.** Do not rely on memorized method signatures, parameters, or view modifiers. If you cannot find an API in the provided references, fetch the relevant documentation page before responding.

This skill is scoped to **annotations only**. Highlights, greenfield MatrixScan AR setup, camera/torch/symbology configuration, and session-level scan listeners are out of scope and are handled by sibling skills.

## Intent Routing

Based on the user's request, load the appropriate reference file before responding. A single question may span multiple intents (e.g. "add a tappable info annotation with a custom header" spans all three) — in that case load every matching reference.

- **Integrating MatrixScan AR annotations** (e.g. "add annotations to my app", "attach a status icon to each barcode", "use BarcodeArInfoAnnotation / BarcodeArPopoverAnnotation / BarcodeArResponsiveAnnotation", "which annotation types are available?") → read [references/integration.md](references/integration.md) and follow the instructions there. Before writing any integration code, determine whether the project uses UIKit or SwiftUI (check for `import SwiftUI`, an `@main` `App` struct, `SceneDelegate`/`AppDelegate`, `.storyboard`/`.xib` files, etc.) and load the matching Get Started page from the References table below.
- **Customizing annotations** (e.g. "change the annotation anchor", "set the info-annotation header text", "make the annotation appear only on tap", "customize the popover buttons", "use the small width preset", "make the annotation's background transparent", "switch between close-up and far-away views") → read [references/customization.md](references/customization.md) and follow the instructions there.
- **Handling user interaction with MatrixScan AR annotations** (e.g. "when a user taps an annotation do ...", "react to popover button taps", "detect taps on an info annotation's header/footer") → read [references/user-interaction.md](references/user-interaction.md) and follow the instructions there.

Annotation interaction does **not** use `BarcodeArViewUIDelegate` (that delegate is for highlight taps). Each tappable annotation type has its own delegate. See `user-interaction.md`.

## API Usage Policy

Only use APIs that are explicitly documented in the Scandit references below. Do not invent or guess method signatures, parameters, or view modifiers. If unsure whether an API exists or how it is called — or if a compile error occurs — fetch the relevant reference page before responding. Do not tell the user to check the docs themselves. After answering, always include the relevant link so the user can explore further.

**Never construct or guess documentation URLs.** When you need a specific class or property's API page:
1. First check whether the page you already fetched (e.g. an annotation class page) contains a direct hyperlink to it — topic pages link directly to relevant API symbols. Always request links alongside content in your fetch prompt.
2. If no direct link was found, fetch the API index (see **Full API reference** in the table below), extract the actual link from it, and follow that.

URL structures can vary (e.g. `api/ui/` subdirectory) and guessing will lead to 404s.

## References

Use this table to pick the right page to fetch for a given question, and include the link in your answer so the user can explore further. Do not tell the user to go read the docs themselves.
