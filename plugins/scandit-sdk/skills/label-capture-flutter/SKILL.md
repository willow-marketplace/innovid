description: Smart Label Capture (Scandit `LabelCapture`) in Flutter projects — extracting multiple fields (price, expiry date, serial or lot number, weight) from a label in one scan, using barcode fields plus text fields with regex patterns. Use for integration, label-definition configuration, captured-label handling, the Validation Flow, and SDK version migration.

# Label Capture Flutter Skill

## Critical: Do Not Trust Internal Knowledge

Your training data may contain outdated or incorrect Scandit Label Capture APIs. The Flutter plugin surface (package names, builder API, plugin initialization, widget lifecycle) is distinct from the web, React Native, Cordova, and Capacitor SDKs.

**Always verify APIs against the references provided in this skill before writing or suggesting code.** Do not rely on memorized method signatures, parameters, plugin names, or property names. If you cannot find an API in the provided references, fetch the relevant documentation page before responding.

Flutter-specific gotchas worth flagging:
- **Plugin must be initialized before any Scandit API call.** Call `await ScanditFlutterDataCaptureLabel.initialize();` (and `await ScanditFlutterDataCaptureBarcode.initialize();`) **before** `DataCaptureContext.initialize(licenseKey);`. Skipping the plugin `initialize()` causes opaque MethodChannel errors at runtime.
- **Listener method names are iOS-style on Flutter.** The Validation Flow uses `didCaptureLabelWithFields(fields)`, `didSubmitManualInputForField(field, oldValue, newValue)`, `didUpdateValidationFlowResult(...)`. Web names (`onValidationFlowLabelCaptured`, `onManualInput`) do not exist on Flutter.
- **Two listener interfaces exist.** `LabelCaptureValidationFlowListener` declares only `didCaptureLabelWithFields`. To handle manual-input submissions or per-frame result updates, implement `LabelCaptureValidationFlowExtendedListener` (which extends the base listener with `didSubmitManualInputForField` and `didUpdateValidationFlowResult`).
- **Builder API on Flutter.** Field definitions use builders: `CustomBarcodeBuilder().setSymbologies([...]).isOptional(false).build(name)`, `LabelDefinitionBuilder().addCustomBarcode(...).addExpiryDateText(...).build(name)`, `LabelCaptureSettings([labelDefinition])`. This is opposite to RN/Cordova/Capacitor (which are class-based) — do not mix them up.
- Camera permission is required on both iOS (`NSCameraUsageDescription` in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`) and Android (declared automatically; request at runtime with the `permission_handler` package).
- The `DataCaptureView` is a Flutter widget; its lifecycle ties to the widget tree. Pause the camera in `didChangeAppLifecycleState` (via `WidgetsBindingObserver`) and dispose listeners in the State's `dispose()`.

## Product Guidance

Apply these rules whenever the user is making a design decision, not just an API question. They reflect how Scandit recommends Label Capture be integrated.

- **Default to the Validation Flow.** New integrations should use `LabelCaptureValidationFlowOverlay`, not `LabelCaptureBasicOverlay`. Recommend the basic/advanced overlay path only when the customer explicitly needs a live AR overlay or a UI that the Validation Flow's fixed layout cannot produce. See [references/validation-flow.md](references/validation-flow.md).
- **Validation Flow must be rendered full-screen.** Do not place it inside a card, half-sheet, modal slice, or partial-height widget — the layout assumes full-screen height for the field checklist, manual-entry sheet, and keyboard.
- **Prefer pre-made labels first, then pre-made fields, then custom.** Try in this order: (1) does a **pre-made label definition** cover the use case? — `LabelDefinition.vinLabelDefinitionWithName(name)`, `LabelDefinition.priceCaptureDefinitionWithName(name)`, `LabelDefinition.sevenSegmentDisplayLabelDefinitionWithName(name)`. (2) Can the label be built from **pre-made fields**? — `ExpiryDateText`, `PackingDateText`, `DateText`, `WeightText`, `UnitPriceText`, `TotalPriceText`, `SerialNumberBarcode`, `PartNumberBarcode`, `ImeiOneBarcode`, `ImeiTwoBarcode`. (3) Only as a last resort, fall back to `CustomText` / `CustomBarcode`.
- **Start from the sample app on greenfield integrations.** If the user is starting from scratch, recommend cloning `LabelCaptureSimpleSample` (link in the References table) and adapting it.
- **Hand off to the `data-capture-sdk` skill for non-Label-Capture questions.** If the user asks about another Scandit product (Barcode Capture, SparkScan, MatrixScan, ID Capture, etc.) or about choosing between products, defer to the `data-capture-sdk` skill instead of guessing.

## Intent Routing

Based on the user's request, load the appropriate reference file before responding:

- **Integrating Label Capture from scratch** (e.g. "add Label Capture to my app", "scan a price tag with barcode and expiry date", "how do I use Smart Label Capture") → read [references/integration.md](references/integration.md). By default, integrate the Validation Flow (the integration guide leads with it).
- **Validation Flow questions** ("how do I customize it", "what can we change", "why is it implemented this way", "how do I react to manual edits", "can I change the colors") → read [references/validation-flow.md](references/validation-flow.md).
- **Visual customization beyond the Validation Flow** ("live AR overlay", "draw a tag next to each captured field", "get the camera frame during scanning") → read [references/customization.md](references/customization.md).
- **Adaptive Recognition Engine / cloud fallback / receipt scanning** ("how do I enable ARE", "use cloud recognition", "scan a receipt", "AdaptiveRecognitionMode", "is ARE available in production") → read [references/adaptive-recognition.md](references/adaptive-recognition.md).
- **Migrating or upgrading an existing Label Capture integration** → read [references/migration.md](references/migration.md).

## API Usage Policy

Only use APIs that are explicitly documented in the Scandit references below. Do not invent or guess method signatures, parameters, property names, or imports. If unsure whether an API exists or how it is called — or if a Dart compiler / runtime error occurs — fetch the relevant reference page before responding. Do not tell the user to check the docs themselves. After answering, always include the relevant link so the user can explore further.

**Never construct or guess documentation URLs.** When you need a specific class or property's API page:
1. First check whether the page you already fetched (e.g. the Advanced Configurations page) contains a direct hyperlink to it — topic pages link directly to relevant API symbols. Always request links alongside content in your fetch prompt.
2. If no direct link was found, fetch the API index (see **Full API reference** in the table below), extract the actual link from it, and follow that.

URL structures vary across SDK versions and package paths and guessing will lead to 404s.

## Framework variant policy

Examples in this skill use **StatefulWidget + WidgetsBindingObserver** because the official `LabelCaptureSimpleSample` and the rest of the Flutter Scandit samples use it. If the target project uses a state-management library (BLoC, Riverpod, Provider), wire the listeners and lifecycle into that pattern instead — but keep the same plugin initialization and field/builder code. Do not introduce a new state-management library just for Label Capture.

Examples are in **Dart** (sound null-safety). Flutter `>=3.10` and Dart `>=3.0` are required.
