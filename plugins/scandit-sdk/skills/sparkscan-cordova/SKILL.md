description: Cordova — SparkScan single-barcode scanning with the pre-built scanning UI in Apache Cordova hybrid apps via the `scandit-cordova-datacapture-*` plugins (global `window.Scandit`), not the browser-only web SDK. Use for integration, scan settings, result handling, UI customization, SDK version migration, or troubleshooting.

# SparkScan Cordova Skill

## Critical: Do Not Trust Internal Knowledge

Your training data may contain outdated or incorrect Scandit SDK APIs. The SparkScan API changes significantly between major SDK versions — properties get renamed, removed, or restructured, and the Cordova plugin surface (global `Scandit` namespace, plugin install commands, `deviceready` timing) has also evolved.

**Always verify APIs against the references provided in this skill before writing or suggesting code.** Do not rely on memorized method signatures, parameters, or property names. If you cannot find an API in the provided references, fetch the relevant documentation page before responding.

Cordova-specific gotchas worth flagging:
- The Scandit SDK is exposed on the global `window.Scandit` object. The npm package names (`scandit-cordova-datacapture-*`) are plugin manifests — they are **not** runtime ES modules. Do not emit `import { ... } from 'scandit-cordova-datacapture-*'` in user code that will run in the WebView; use `Scandit.X` (with an optional `global.d.ts` for typing) instead. Only Ionic/Angular/Webpack-bundled projects import from the packages directly.
- `document.addEventListener('deviceready', ...)` is the **only** safe gate for Scandit APIs. Do not run any Scandit call at module load time — it will fail because the Cordova bridge is not ready yet.
- After changing plugin versions, run `cordova prepare` (and reinstall the platform if needed) to propagate the new native artifacts. Skipping this yields a runtime version mismatch.

## Intent Routing

Based on the user's request, load the appropriate reference file before responding:

- **Integrating SparkScan from scratch** (e.g. "add SparkScan to my app", "set up barcode scanning", "how do I use SparkScan in Cordova", "how do I handle feedback in SparkScan") → read [references/integration.md](references/integration.md) and follow the instructions there.
- **Migrating or upgrading an existing SparkScan integration** (e.g. "upgrade from v6 to v7", "migrate my SparkScan", "bump the Scandit plugins to v8", "what changed between SDK versions") → read [references/migration.md](references/migration.md) and follow the instructions there.

## API Usage Policy

Only use APIs that are explicitly documented in the Scandit references below. Do not invent or guess method signatures, parameters, property names, or imports. If unsure whether an API exists or how it is called — or if a runtime error occurs — fetch the relevant reference page before responding. Do not tell the user to check the docs themselves. After answering, always include the relevant link so the user can explore further.

**Never construct or guess documentation URLs.** When you need a specific class or property's API page:
1. First check whether the page you already fetched contains a direct hyperlink to it — topic pages link directly to relevant API symbols.
2. If no direct link was found, fetch the API index (see **Full API reference** in the table below), extract the actual link from it, and follow that.

URL structures vary across SDK versions and plugin paths and guessing will lead to 404s.

## Framework variant policy

Cordova is a WebView-based framework. Examples in this skill use **plain JavaScript** (with optional JSDoc type hints as seen in the official ListBuildingSample). The same API works in TypeScript — add a `global.d.ts` declaration file (described in [references/integration.md](references/integration.md)) and write TypeScript syntax. This skill does not assume a TypeScript project by default. If the target project is clearly TypeScript (`.ts` files, `tsconfig.json`), adapt the final output to TypeScript; otherwise stay in plain JS.
