name: label-capture-capacitor
description: Smart Label Capture (Scandit `LabelCapture`) in Capacitor projects — extracting multiple fields (price, expiry date, serial or lot number, weight) from a label in one scan, using barcode fields plus text fields with regex patterns. Use for integration, label-definition configuration, captured-label handling, the Validation Flow, and SDK version migration.

# Label Capture Capacitor Skill

## Critical: Do Not Trust Internal Knowledge

Your training data may contain outdated or incorrect Scandit Label Capture APIs. The Capacitor plugin surface (ES module imports, `initializePlugins()`, `webViewContentOnTop` toggle) is distinct from the web, React Native, Flutter, and Cordova SDKs.

**Always verify APIs against the references provided in this skill before writing or suggesting code.** Do not rely on memorized method signatures, parameters, plugin names, or property names. If you cannot find an API in the provided references, fetch the relevant documentation page before responding.

Capacitor-specific gotchas worth flagging:
- **Plugins must be initialized first.** Call `await ScanditCaptureCorePlugin.initializePlugins();` **before** `DataCaptureContext.initialize(licenseKey)`. Skipping this step causes plugin-bridge errors at runtime.
- **`webViewContentOnTop` toggle.** The native scan view sits *behind* the WebView. While scanning, set `view.webViewContentOnTop = false` so native overlay UI receives touch events. To show DOM-based UI on top (e.g. a result modal), flip back to `view.webViewContentOnTop = true`. Forgetting this is the most common cause of "modal/buttons don't work during scanning" or "scan UI is invisible".
- **Listener method names are iOS-style on Capacitor.** The Validation Flow listener uses `didCaptureLabelWithFields(fields)`, `didSubmitManualInputForField(field, oldValue, newValue)`, `didUpdateValidationFlowResult(...)`. Web names (`onValidationFlowLabelCaptured`, `onManualInput`) do not exist on Capacitor.
- **Class-based field API**, same shape as RN/Cordova (and opposite to Flutter). `CustomBarcode.initWithNameAndSymbologies(...)`, `new ExpiryDateText(...)`, `field.optional = false`, `LabelCaptureSettings.settingsFromLabelDefinitions([...], {})`. There is no `LabelCaptureSettingsBuilder` / `LabelDefinitionBuilder` and no v8.5 factory-function sugar — those are web-only.
- After installing or upgrading Scandit packages, run `npx cap sync` (and `cd ios/App && pod install` for iOS).
- Camera permission: iOS requires `NSCameraUsageDescription` in `ios/App/App/Info.plist`. Android: declared automatically by the plugin; request at runtime via `@capacitor/camera` or `@capgo/permission` if `minSdkVersion >= 23`.

## Product Guidance

Apply these rules whenever the user is making a design decision, not just an API question. They reflect how Scandit recommends Label Capture be integrated.

- **Default to the Validation Flow.** New integrations should use `LabelCaptureValidationFlowOverlay`, not `LabelCaptureBasicOverlay`. Recommend the basic/advanced overlay path only when the customer explicitly needs a live AR overlay or a UI that the Validation Flow's fixed layout cannot produce. See [references/validation-flow.md](references/validation-flow.md).
- **Validation Flow must be rendered full-screen.** Do not place it inside a card, half-sheet, modal slice, or partial-height widget — the layout assumes full-screen height for the field checklist, manual-entry sheet, and keyboard.
- **Prefer pre-made labels first, then pre-made fields, then custom.** Try in this order: (1) does a **pre-made label definition** cover the use case? — `LabelDefinition.createVinLabelDefinition(name)`, `LabelDefinition.createPriceCaptureDefinition(name)`, `LabelDefinition.createSevenSegmentDisplayLabelDefinition(name)`. (2) Can the label be built from **pre-made fields**? — `ExpiryDateText`, `PackingDateText`, `DateText`, `WeightText`, `UnitPriceText`, `TotalPriceText`, `SerialNumberBarcode`, `PartNumberBarcode`, `ImeiOneBarcode`, `ImeiTwoBarcode`. (3) Only as a last resort, fall back to `CustomText` / `CustomBarcode`.
- **Start from the sample app on greenfield integrations.** If the user is starting from scratch, recommend cloning `LabelCaptureSimpleSample` (link in the References table) and adapting it.
- **Hand off to the `data-capture-sdk` skill for non-Label-Capture questions.** If the user asks about another Scandit product (Barcode Capture, SparkScan, MatrixScan, ID Capture, etc.) or about choosing between products, defer to the `data-capture-sdk` skill instead of guessing.

## Intent Routing

- **Integrating Label Capture from scratch** → read [references/integration.md](references/integration.md). By default, integrate the Validation Flow (the integration guide leads with it).
- **Validation Flow questions** ("how do I customize it", "what can we change", "why is it implemented this way", "how do I react to manual edits", "can I change the colors") → read [references/validation-flow.md](references/validation-flow.md).
- **Visual customization beyond the Validation Flow** ("live AR overlay", "draw a tag next to each captured field", "get the camera frame during scanning") → read [references/customization.md](references/customization.md).
- **Adaptive Recognition Engine / cloud fallback / receipt scanning** ("how do I enable ARE", "use cloud recognition", "scan a receipt", "AdaptiveRecognitionMode", "is ARE available in production") → read [references/adaptive-recognition.md](references/adaptive-recognition.md).
- **Migrating or upgrading an existing Label Capture integration** → read [references/migration.md](references/migration.md).

## API Usage Policy

Only use APIs that are explicitly documented in the Scandit references below. Do not invent or guess method signatures, parameters, property names, or imports. If unsure whether an API exists, or if a runtime error occurs, fetch the relevant reference page before responding. Do not tell the user to check the docs themselves. After answering, always include the relevant link.

**Never construct or guess documentation URLs.** Either follow a hyperlink already present in a fetched page, or fetch the API index and follow the link from there.

## Framework variant policy

Examples in this skill use **plain JavaScript with ES module imports** because that is the default for Capacitor templates and the official `LabelCaptureSimpleSample`. If the target project uses a framework (React, Vue, Angular, Ionic), keep the Scandit init/setup outside the component tree (e.g. in a small module that exports the singleton context) and call into it from the framework component. Don't introduce a state-management library just for Label Capture.
