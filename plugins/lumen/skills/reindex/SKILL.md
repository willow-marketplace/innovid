# Lumen Reindex

Refresh or rebuild the bundled Lumen index for the current project.

## Steps

1. Call the Lumen `index_status` tool for the current working directory so you
   can report the current state before making changes.
2. If the user wants the index refreshed or seeded, call the Lumen
   `semantic_search` tool with a broad natural-language query and set `path` or
   `cwd` to the current working directory. The search tool refreshes stale or
   missing indexes automatically.
3. If the user explicitly asks for a clean rebuild, explain the options and
   run one via the shell:
   - `lumen index --force .` — rebuilds only the current project's index from
     scratch. Prefer this.
   - `lumen clean --days 0 && lumen index .` — deletes every eligible cached
     index except those protected by active locks, then rebuilds. Use only when
     the user asks for a full wipe.
   - `lumen clean` — removes indexes for projects that no longer exist or have
     not been used in 30 days. Use to reclaim disk space, not to rebuild the
     current project.
4. After the refresh or rebuild, report the new index status.
