"""Run the committed fixture asserters in CI.

Two tiers:

1. GOLDEN — asserters whose fixture directory contains a committed golden
   run tree. The asserter is executed against that tree and MUST exit 0.
   This makes every committed exact-math guarantee (workshop scenario
   deltas, reprice totals) a permanent CI invariant instead of a
   run-it-by-hand convention.

2. SMOKE — asserters that validate a live replay run dir (no golden output
   is committed; producing one requires an agent run). These are executed
   against an empty scratch directory and MUST exit non-zero WITHOUT a
   Python traceback: a clean assertion failure proves the script still
   parses and its failure path works (bitrot guard).

Zero dependencies (stdlib only), mirroring the asserters themselves.
Exit 0 iff every check passes.
