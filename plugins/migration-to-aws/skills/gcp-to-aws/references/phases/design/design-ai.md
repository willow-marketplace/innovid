# Design Phase: AI Workloads (Bedrock)

> Loaded by `design.md` when `ai-workload-profile.json` exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

---

## Step 0: Load Inputs

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/ai-workload-profile.json`:

- `summary.ai_source` — `"gemini"`, `"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"both"`, `"other"`
- `models[]` — Detected AI models with service, capabilities, evidence
- `integration` — SDK, frameworks, languages, gateway type, capability summary
- `infrastructure[]` — Terraform resources related to AI (may be empty)
- `current_costs` — Present only if billing data or OpenAI usage API data was provided (`source` field records which)

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json` → `ai_constraints` (if present). If absent: use defaults (prefer managed Bedrock, no latency constraint, no budget cap).

**Region selection for AI workloads:** If `design_constraints.target_region` was derived from GCP region proximity (not explicitly chosen by the user), verify the selected Bedrock models are available in that region. Use the AWS Documentation MCP server to check model availability. If the target region lacks the selected model, prefer the geographically closest AWS region where it is available.

**Load source-specific design reference based on `ai_source`:**

- `"gemini"` → load `references/design-refs/ai-gemini-to-bedrock.md`
- `"openai"` → load `references/design-refs/ai-openai-to-bedrock.md`
- `"anthropic"` → load `references/design-refs/ai-anthropic-to-bedrock.md` (Anthropic SDK → Bedrock Converse API client swap; do NOT use ai-openai-to-bedrock.md for Anthropic SDK users)
- `"both"` → load both `ai-gemini-to-bedrock.md` and `ai-openai-to-bedrock.md`
- `"other"` or absent → load `references/design-refs/ai.md` (traditional ML rubric — Vision API, Speech API, Document AI, custom models only; do NOT use for Anthropic SDK users)

**Additional load, independent of `ai_source` above:** If any entry in `workloads[]` (from `preferences.json`, falling back to `ai-workload-profile.json`) has `capability` equal to `document_extraction`, `image_analysis`, or `speech_transcription`, ALSO load `references/design-refs/ai.md` — even when a generative `ai_source` already selected a different ref above. A workload's non-generative capability is evaluated independently of the codebase's primary LLM provider; e.g. an `ai_source: "openai"` codebase that also calls `documentai.process_document` needs both `ai-openai-to-bedrock.md` (for its GPT workload) and `ai.md` (for its Document AI workload).

---

## Step 0.5: Regional Availability Validation

Read target region from `preferences.json` → `design_constraints.target_region` (default: `us-east-1`).

Call `get_regional_availability` from the `awsknowledge` MCP server for:

1. Each Bedrock model ID being considered (from the loaded model mapping tables)
2. If `agentic_profile.is_agentic == true`: check `bedrock-agentcore` (Runtime)
3. If `agentic_profile.is_agentic == true` AND `ai_constraints.agentic.migration_approach == "harness"`: check `bedrock-agentcore` harness capability

**If any recommended service is unavailable in target region:**

- Add to `regional_warnings[]` in output: `{"service": "...", "target_region": "...", "nearest_available": "...", "impact": "..."}`
- Note in user summary with alternative region suggestion
- Do NOT block the design — proceed with the recommendation and flag the constraint

**If MCP call fails after 3 attempts:** Use the static table in `references/shared/ai-migration-guardrails.md` as fallback. Add `"regional_validation": "fallback_static"` to output metadata.

---

## Step 0.6: Agentic Design Routing

**Skip this step if `agentic_profile` is absent from `ai-workload-profile.json`.**

If `agentic_profile.is_agentic == true`:

1. Load `references/shared/ai-migration-guardrails.md` (shared warnings — load once, do not reload in sub-files)
2. Read `preferences.json` → `ai_constraints.agentic.migration_approach`
3. Route based on approach:

| `migration_approach` | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"retarget"`         | Continue with standard model-swap design below (Parts 1–6). The existing framework stays; only the model layer changes. Load `references/shared/retarget-gotchas.md` for framework-specific migration pitfalls to include in the code migration plan (Part 5).                                                                                            |
| `"harness"`          | Load `references/design-refs/design-ref-harness.md`. If file does not exist: continue with standard model-swap design, add note to user summary: "AgentCore Harness design reference not yet available. Proceeding with model-layer migration only. For Harness guidance, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness.html" |
| `"strands"`          | Load `references/design-refs/design-ref-agentic-to-agentcore.md`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `"undecided"`        | Treat as `"retarget"` (safest default). Note in user summary: "No migration approach selected — defaulting to retarget (keep framework, swap model layer). Re-run Clarify to select a different approach."                                                                                                                                                |

**Regardless of approach:** Continue with Parts 1–6 below for model selection and mapping. The agentic design ref (Harness/Strands) adds agent infrastructure on top of the model-layer design — it does not replace it.

---

## Step 0.7: Apply Compliance Constraints

Read `preferences.json` → `design_constraints.compliance` (from full-flow Q2 or AI-only Q1.5). **Skip this step only when the value is `none`, `unknown`, or absent** (`unknown` = defaulted, never user-confirmed — behaves like `none` for model/region selection but the report caveat is REQUIRED; absent = pre-Q1.5 preferences; treat as `none` with the report caveat intact). Otherwise, apply BEFORE Part 1 model selection — these are hard filters, not preferences:

| Compliance value | Constraint applied in this design                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hipaa`          | Candidate models restricted to **BAA-eligible Bedrock models** — verify eligibility per model via the AWS Documentation MCP server before shortlisting. Add to the code migration plan (Part 5): Bedrock invocation logging keeps ORIGINAL content in CloudWatch (Guardrails PII masking does not apply to logs) — require KMS encryption + restricted IAM on the log group. Prefer us-east-1/us-west-2. |
| `fedramp`        | Target region forced to **GovCloud** (us-gov-east-1/us-gov-west-1); re-run Step 0.5 regional validation against GovCloud — the model catalog is materially smaller, and a `regional_warnings[]` entry is REQUIRED for every candidate model not available there.                                                                                                                                         |
| `gdpr`           | Target region restricted to EU (eu-west-1, eu-central-1); model IDs must use **geographic `eu.` inference profiles** — `global.` profiles route outside the EU boundary and are forbidden. Note the GCP-EU → AWS-EU transfer in the summary.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pci`            | Part 5 plan must include: no cardholder data in prompts without tokenization; CloudTrail on Bedrock API calls; scoped IAM (no `bedrock:*`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `soc2` / `ccpa`  | Part 5 plan must include CloudTrail audit logging; CCPA additionally: prompt/completion retention policy + deletion workflow for logged content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Record what was applied: every constraint that changed a model choice or region adds a `regional_warnings[]` entry (existing shape) or a Part 5 plan line naming the compliance value that forced it, and the Present Summary section MUST state which compliance regime(s) shaped the design. A design that ignores a declared compliance value is a validation failure (see Validation Checklist).

## Part 1: Bedrock Model Selection

**Multi-workload iteration (when `workloads[]` is present):**

If `preferences.json` contains a non-empty `workloads[]` array (written by Clarify after user confirmation), iterate per workload instead of per model. **Design MUST read workloads from `preferences.json` (not `ai-workload-profile.json`)** because Clarify may have edited, dropped, or re-confirmed rows.

Fallback: if `preferences.json` has no `workloads[]` field but `ai-workload-profile.json` does, use the profile's `workloads[]` directly (no user edits were made).

For each `workloads[]` entry:

1. **Use the workload's `capability` to select the Bedrock target class:**

   | Capability             | Target Class                                                      | Default Model / Service                                            |
   | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `text_generation`      | Text/reasoning                                                    | Apply override hierarchy below                                     |
   | `structured_output`    | Text/reasoning (same models support structured output)            | Apply override hierarchy below                                     |
   | `image_generation`     | Image generation                                                  | Stability AI (Core / Ultra)                                        |
   | `embedding`            | Embedding                                                         | Amazon Titan Embed Text v2                                         |
   | `speech_to_text`       | Speech-to-text                                                    | Amazon Transcribe                                                  |
   | `text_to_speech`       | Text-to-speech                                                    | Amazon Polly                                                       |
   | `document_extraction`  | Traditional AI (non-Bedrock) — see `references/design-refs/ai.md` | AWS Textract (variant per detected GCP Document AI processor type) |
   | `image_analysis`       | Traditional AI (non-Bedrock) — see `references/design-refs/ai.md` | AWS Rekognition                                                    |
   | `speech_transcription` | Traditional AI (non-Bedrock) — see `references/design-refs/ai.md` | AWS Transcribe                                                     |
   | `unknown`              | Text/reasoning (default)                                          | Apply override hierarchy below                                     |

   **`document_extraction`, `image_analysis`, `speech_transcription` are not Bedrock models.** For these three capabilities:
   - Do NOT set `target_bedrock_model` — leave it `null`.
   - Set `target_aws_service` instead (e.g., `"textract"`, `"rekognition"`, `"transcribe"`) using the mapping from `references/design-refs/ai.md`.
   - Skip the override hierarchy in step 2 below — Q16–Q19 preferences (quality/speed/cost model tuning) don't apply to these services; there is no model tier to select.
   - `honest_assessment` (Part 1 continued, below) does not apply — these are feature/service swaps, not a cost-driven model migration decision. Set `honest_assessment: "not_applicable"` for these workloads in the output.

2. **For text/reasoning capabilities:** Apply the existing override hierarchy from `ai_constraints`:
   - Q17 special features (hard override) > Q16 priority > Q18/Q21 volume and latency > source model baseline
   - This ensures single-workload sophistication is preserved per workload

3. **Emit one `design_block` per workload** in `aws-design-ai.json`:

   ```json
   "design_blocks": [
     {
       "workload_id": "wl_3a1f2c",
       "model_id": "gemini-2.5-flash",
       "target_bedrock_model": "amazon.nova-lite-v1:0",
       "target_aws_service": null,
       "capability": "text_generation",
       "capability_confidence": "medium",
       "rationale": "text_generation + medium confidence + balanced priority → Nova Lite",
       "confidence_warning": null
     },
     {
       "workload_id": "wl_8b4e91",
       "model_id": "documentai.process_document",
       "target_bedrock_model": null,
       "target_aws_service": "textract",
       "capability": "document_extraction",
       "capability_confidence": "high",
       "rationale": "document_extraction (GCP Document AI) → AWS Textract per references/design-refs/ai.md",
       "confidence_warning": null
     }
   ]
   ```

   **Field contract addition:** `target_aws_service` is `null` for all Bedrock-model capabilities (`text_generation`, `structured_output`, `image_generation`, `embedding`, `speech_to_text`, `text_to_speech`, `unknown`) and is one of `"textract"`, `"rekognition"`, `"transcribe"` for the three traditional-AI capabilities. `target_bedrock_model` and `target_aws_service` are mutually exclusive — exactly one is non-null per `design_block`.

4. **Confidence warning:** Set `confidence_warning` to a non-null string (identifying the workload and noting manual review required) when `capability_confidence == "low"`. Null for `high` and `medium`.

5. **Preserve input order:** `design_blocks[]` order matches `workloads[]` order.

6. **Empty workloads:** If `workloads[]` is empty, emit `aws-design-ai.json` with `"design_blocks": []` and proceed with the existing `models[]` path below as fallback.

**Fallback (no `workloads[]` or single entry):** If `workloads[]` is absent or has exactly one entry, fall through to the existing per-model logic below (backward compatible).

---

For each model in `models[]`, select the best-fit Bedrock model using the loaded design reference mapping tables. Do NOT use a hardcoded mapping — the design-ref files contain tier-organized tables with pricing and competitive analysis.

Treat model mapping as compatibility-guided, not 1:1 parity. Before cutover, require validation of prompts, tool-calling behavior, and eval metrics for the selected Bedrock model.

**If `models[]` is empty:** Skip per-model rows; output a short **placeholder strategy** (one representative Bedrock model family per `ai_source` rubric) and dependency on Clarify answers — do not fabricate `models[]` entries.

**Apply user preference overrides from `ai_constraints`:**

| Preference                | Override                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ai_priority = "cost"`    | Prefer "Winner" column; flag if source is cheaper |
| `ai_priority = "quality"` | Prefer Claude Sonnet/Opus regardless of cost      |
| `ai_priority = "speed"`   | Prefer Claude Sonnet (fastest integration)        |
| `ai_latency = "critical"` | Prefer smaller/faster models (Haiku, Nova Lite)   |
| `ai_latency = "flexible"` | Any model; flag Batch API for 50% savings         |

**Stay-or-migrate assessment per model:**

- Bedrock cheaper → `"strong_migrate"`
- Bedrock within 25% of source AND priority != cost → `"moderate_migrate"`
- Source > 25% cheaper AND priority = cost → `"weak_migrate"` or `"recommend_stay"`

Overall assessment = weakest across all models. If any `"recommend_stay"`, flag prominently.

**Model comparison table** (include in output and user summary): Model, Provider, Max Context, Input/Output Price per 1M, Price Comparison, Streaming, Function Calling, Assessment.

**Quota risk assessment** (per `references/shared/bedrock-quotas.md`):

After selecting models, assess quota risk based on `ai_token_volume` from `preferences.json`:

| `ai_token_volume`         | Selected Model Family              | `quota_risk` | Action                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"high"` or `"very_high"` | Any                                | `"high"`     | Flag: "Request Bedrock quota increase before migration (allow 1–5 business days)" |
| `"medium"`                | Claude (5× burndown)               | `"medium"`   | Flag: "Monitor TPM usage; quota increase may be needed at peak"                   |
| `"medium"`                | Nova / Llama / other (1× burndown) | `"low"`      | No action                                                                         |
| `"low"`                   | Any                                | `"low"`      | No action                                                                         |

Include `quota_risk` in `aws-design-ai.json` → `ai_architecture` alongside `honest_assessment`.

---

## Part 1B: Volume-Based Strategy

If `ai_token_volume` is `"high"`, generate a `tiered_strategy`:

| Tier | Traffic | Model Selection              | Use Cases                                            |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | 60%     | Nova Micro or Llama 4 Scout  | Classification, extraction, short answers, routing   |
| 2    | 30%     | Llama 4 Maverick or Nova Pro | Summarization, moderate generation, Q&A with context |
| 3    | 10%     | Claude Sonnet 5              | Reasoning, long-form, agentic tasks, tool use        |

Set `tiered_strategy: null` for low/medium volume.

**Intelligent Prompt Routing — automated alternative to manual tiering:**
If `ai_token_volume` is `"high"` AND the selected models are within the same family
(e.g., Claude Haiku + Claude Sonnet, or Nova Lite + Nova Pro), note Bedrock Intelligent
Prompt Routing as an option. It automatically routes each request to the cheapest model
that can handle it at adequate quality — the AWS-native automation of the tiered strategy above.

> Intelligent Prompt Routing only routes within a single model family. It does NOT replace
> cross-provider routing (e.g., Claude ↔ GPT-4o). If the startup was using OpenRouter or
> LiteLLM to route across providers, they still need app-level routing for cross-family calls.
> One-line caveat: adds a routing-prediction latency hop; verify model support at
> docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-routing.html before recommending.

## Part 1C: Multi-Model Coordination Warnings

If `models[]` contains more than one model, check for coordination patterns and generate warnings. These help the user understand that migrating multiple models requires coordinated testing, not independent swaps.

**Check and warn:**

1. **Embeddings + generation model detected** — If `models[]` contains both an embeddings model (capabilities_used includes `"embeddings"`) AND a text generation model:
   > ⚠️ "Migrating the embedding model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small → Titan Embeddings v2) requires re-embedding all documents in your vector store. Plan for re-indexing time and temporary storage. Test retrieval quality with the new embeddings before switching generation model."
   > ⚠️ "Verify vector index dimension compatibility before cutover. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small outputs 1536 dimensions; Titan Embeddings v2 is configurable (256, 512, or 1024). A mismatch will cause insert failures at the vector store layer — your index must be rebuilt at the target dimension before any data is written."

2. **Models at different price tiers** — If `models[]` contains both a mini/nano/lite model AND a flagship model (infer from model_id naming: `*-mini`, `*-nano`, `*-lite` vs flagship):
   > ⚠️ "These models appear to work as a cascade or routing pattern (cheap model for classification/filtering, expensive model for generation). Test the Bedrock replacement pair together — validate that the cheaper model's classification accuracy is preserved with its Bedrock equivalent before testing the expensive model."

3. **More than 3 models** — If `models[]` count > 3:
   > ⚠️ "Multiple models detected ([count]). Recommend a tiered migration strategy: migrate and validate one model at a time, starting with the lowest-risk (highest-volume, simplest task). See Part 1B for tiered routing recommendations."

4. **Text generation + image generation** — If `models[]` contains both text generation AND image generation capabilities:
   > ⚠️ "Image generation migration (e.g., DALL-E/gpt-image → Stability AI) requires separate evaluation. Image quality is subjective — plan for human evaluation alongside automated metrics. Default to Stable Image Core (cost-first) or Stable Image Ultra (quality-first); do not recommend Nova Canvas."

5. **Speech models** — If `models[]` contains speech-to-text or text-to-speech capabilities:
   > ⚠️ "Speech model migration targets different AWS services (Whisper → Amazon Transcribe, TTS → Amazon Polly or Nova Sonic) with different pricing models and APIs. These are not Bedrock model swaps — they require separate integration work."

Record all triggered warnings in `aws-design-ai.json` → `multi_model_warnings[]`. Each warning: `{"type": "embeddings_reindex|cascade_pair|multi_model_tiered|image_separate|speech_separate", "message": "..."}`.

## Part 2: Feature Parity Validation

For each capability in `integration.capabilities_summary` that is `true`, check Bedrock parity:

| Capability        | Vertex AI               | Amazon Bedrock                   | Parity  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Text Generation   | GenerativeModel API     | Converse API                     | Full    |
| Streaming         | stream_generate_content | InvokeModelWithResponseStream    | Full    |
| Function Calling  | Tool declarations       | Tool use in Converse API         | Full    |
| Embeddings        | TextEmbeddingModel      | Titan Embeddings via InvokeModel | Full    |
| Vision/Multimodal | Gemini multimodal input | Claude multimodal messages       | Full    |
| Batch Processing  | BatchPredictionJob      | Batch Inference (async)          | Partial |
| Fine-tuning       | Vertex AI tuning        | Bedrock Custom Model             | Partial |
| Grounding / RAG   | Vertex AI Search & RAG  | Bedrock Knowledge Bases          | Full    |
| Agents            | Vertex AI Agent Builder | Bedrock AgentCore (Harness)      | Full    |

Record `capability_gaps[]` for any Partial or None parity.

## Part 3: Analyze Detected Workloads

For each model in `models[]`, record:

- **Workload type**: text generation, embeddings, vision, code generation, custom model
- **Integration pattern mapping**:

| GCP Pattern  | AWS Pattern                                      | Effort  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `direct_sdk` | Mantle OpenAI-compat (if OpenAI source + region) | Minimal |
| `direct_sdk` | Bedrock SDK (boto3 / AWS SDK)                    | Medium  |
| `framework`  | LangChain/LlamaIndex + Bedrock                   | Low     |
| `rest_api`   | Bedrock REST API                                 | Medium  |
| `mixed`      | Match per-model                                  | Varies  |

- **Migration complexity**: Low / Medium / High

## Part 4: Infrastructure Mapping

Map GCP AI infrastructure to AWS equivalents:

| GCP Resource                              | AWS Equivalent                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `google_vertex_ai_endpoint`               | Bedrock Model Access (serverless, no infra)     |
| `google_vertex_ai_index` / index_endpoint | OpenSearch Serverless or Bedrock Knowledge Base |
| `google_vertex_ai_featurestore`           | SageMaker Feature Store                         |
| `google_vertex_ai_dataset`                | S3 + Bedrock training job config                |
| `google_vertex_ai_pipeline_job`           | Step Functions + Bedrock                        |

Service accounts with `role: "supports_ai"` → IAM role with Bedrock permissions. Confidence = `inferred`.

## Part 5: Code Migration Plan

For each detected `integration.pattern` and `ai_source`, generate before/after migration examples.

**Patterns to include (matched to detected language and source):**

| Pattern              | Source                    | Target                 | Key Change                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct SDK (OpenAI)  | OpenAI                    | Mantle (OpenAI-compat) | Change `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` + model string (zero code changes)                       |
| Direct SDK           | Vertex AI                 | boto3 Converse API     | `generate_content()` → `converse()`                                                                  |
| Direct SDK           | OpenAI                    | boto3 Converse API     | `completions.create()` → `converse()` (use if Mantle region unavailable or Converse features needed) |
| Direct SDK           | Anthropic                 | boto3 Converse API     | `messages.create()` → `converse()` with Claude model ID on Bedrock                                   |
| LangChain            | ChatVertexAI / ChatOpenAI | ChatBedrock            | Swap import and model_id                                                                             |
| LlamaIndex           | Vertex / OpenAI LLM       | BedrockConverse        | Swap import                                                                                          |
| LLM Router (LiteLLM) | Any                       | Config change          | `model="bedrock/<model_id>"` (1 line)                                                                |
| Embeddings           | TextEmbeddingModel        | Titan Embeddings v2    | `invoke_model` with JSON body                                                                        |
| Streaming            | `stream=True`             | `converse_stream`      | Event loop over `contentBlockDelta`                                                                  |

**Mantle (OpenAI-compatible endpoints):** If `ai_source = "openai"` and `integration.pattern = "direct_sdk"`, prefer the Mantle path as the primary migration option. Mantle provides OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and Responses APIs on Bedrock — the existing OpenAI SDK code works with zero changes, only environment variable updates. Check [Mantle regional availability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-mantle.html) — if the target region does not have Mantle, fall back to the boto3 Converse API path. Record `migration_path: "mantle"` or `migration_path: "converse"` in `aws-design-ai.json` → `ai_architecture.code_migration`.

**Mantle throughput caveat (medium/high volume):** Mantle runs on a shared 10,000 RPM account limit. For workloads with `ai_token_volume = "medium"` or `"high"`, add a note in the design summary: "Mantle is subject to a shared 10K RPM account limit. At medium/high volume, monitor for 429s and consider migrating to `bedrock-runtime` (Converse API) for dedicated throughput." See `references/shared/ai-migration-guardrails.md` for the full risk table.

**gpt-oss migration path:** If `ai_source = "openai"` and the user wants to preserve OpenAI model architecture while consolidating on AWS, offer `gpt-oss` on Bedrock as a fourth migration path alongside Mantle, Converse API, and framework swap. Record `migration_path: "gpt-oss"` in `aws-design-ai.json` → `ai_architecture.code_migration`. The gpt-oss path uses the Converse API with the gpt-oss Bedrock model ID — it is not an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Note the Claude 4.7+ output TPM cap (2M) if the user is migrating from a high-output OpenAI workload.

Generate concrete code examples using actual model IDs from the selected Bedrock models. Only include patterns matching the detected integration.

**OpenRouter-specific guidance** (if `gateway_type == "llm_router"` AND `detection_signals` contains OpenRouter evidence):

OpenRouter is a hosted routing service (not self-hosted like LiteLLM). It adds a margin on top of provider pricing. **First check whether the underlying model is an OpenAI model with a Mantle target** (`ai_source == "openai"`, per the Mantle guidance above) — OpenRouter is a transport layer, not a different model, so an OpenAI model routed through OpenRouter is eligible for the same same-model Mantle path a direct-SDK OpenAI source gets. Present the options below to the user:

> **If the startup was using OpenRouter primarily for cost-based routing within one model family**
> (e.g., routing between Claude Haiku and Claude Sonnet, or Nova Lite and Nova Pro),
> Bedrock Intelligent Prompt Routing is the AWS-native replacement — no routing infrastructure
> needed. If they routed across providers (e.g., Claude ↔ GPT-4o), they still need
> app-level or LiteLLM routing after migration.

| Option                                                                     | Action                                                                                    | Effort    | Trade-off                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A) Same model via Mantle (recommended when the source model is on Bedrock) | Remove OpenRouter, point the existing OpenAI SDK at Bedrock Mantle with the same model ID | Days      | Keeps the same model — no eval/prompt-behavior risk; requires base URL, credential, and model-ID-format changes (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o` → an OpenAI-compatible Bedrock model ID); not a one-line swap |
| B) Direct Bedrock, cross-family                                            | Remove OpenRouter, call Bedrock API directly with a Claude/Nova model                     | 1–2 weeks | Removes middleman + margin; requires SDK + prompt changes; use when no Mantle target exists or cost is the priority                                                                                 |
| C) Self-hosted LiteLLM                                                     | Replace OpenRouter with LiteLLM proxy pointing to Bedrock                                 | 1–3 days  | Preserves router pattern; removes OpenRouter dependency; adds self-hosting                                                                                                                          |
| D) Keep OpenRouter                                                         | Use OpenRouter with `amazon/` prefixed Bedrock models                                     | Hours     | Lowest effort; retains OpenRouter dependency and margin; this is a model switch, not a same-model move                                                                                              |

Recommend **A** when `ai_source == "openai"` and a Mantle target exists (region gate passes per the Mantle guidance above); otherwise recommend **B** and present C/D as lower-effort alternatives. Record user's choice (or the recommended default if not asked) in `aws-design-ai.json` → `code_migration.openrouter_path`: `"same_model_mantle"` / `"direct"` / `"litellm"` / `"keep_openrouter"`.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `metadata.ai_source` matches `summary.ai_source` from input
- [ ] Every model in `models[]` has a corresponding `bedrock_models` entry
- [ ] Every `bedrock_models[]` entry has pricing (`source_provider_price`, `bedrock_price`, `price_comparison`)
- [ ] Every `design_blocks[]` entry with `capability` in {`document_extraction`, `image_analysis`, `speech_transcription`} has `target_bedrock_model: null`, a non-null `target_aws_service`, and `honest_assessment: "not_applicable"` — these are NOT included in `bedrock_models[]` and do NOT need pricing here. (Estimate phase currently excludes them from cost analysis entirely — see `estimate-ai.md` "Traditional-AI workloads" note. Per-page/per-image/per-minute cost modeling for Textract/Rekognition/Transcribe is a known follow-up, not yet implemented.)
- [ ] `capability_mapping` covers every `true` capability from `capabilities_summary`
- [ ] `code_migration.primary_pattern` matches `integration.pattern`
- [ ] All model IDs use current Bedrock identifiers (Active status per `shared/ai-model-lifecycle.md`)
- [ ] No Legacy model is used as `bedrock_models[].aws_model_id` unless no Active alternative exists (with EOL date noted)
- [ ] `honest_assessment` logic is consistent (weakest model drives overall)
- [ ] `regional_warnings` is present (empty array `[]` if no issues; populated if any service unavailable in target region)
- [ ] `multi_model_warnings` is present (empty array `[]` if single model or no coordination issues)
- [ ] If `agentic_profile.is_agentic == true`: `agentic_design` object is present with `migration_approach` matching `preferences.json`
- [ ] If `design_constraints.compliance` is set and not `none`/`unknown`: every Step 0.7 constraint is reflected in the design (BAA-only models for hipaa, GovCloud region for fedramp, `eu.` profiles for gdpr, Part 5 logging lines for pci/soc2/ccpa) and the Present Summary names the regime(s); if `unknown`, the compliance-not-confirmed caveat appears in the summary
- [ ] If `agentic_profile.is_agentic == false` or absent: `agentic_design` is null or absent
