# Phase 2: Clarify Requirements

**Phase 2 of 6** — Confirm assumptions and ask only essential questions before design begins, then interpret answers into ready-to-apply design constraints.

> **HARD GATE — Clarify before Design:** Do not load `references/phases/design/design.md` (or any later phase) until this phase finishes **and** `$MIGRATION_DIR/.phase-status.json` records `phases.clarify` as `"completed"`. Writing `preferences.json` without updating phase status is a protocol violation. If the user asks to skip questions, use documented defaults and still complete this phase (including phase status).

The output — `preferences.json` — is consumed directly by Design and Estimate without any further interpretation.

The question catalog spans **six named categories (A–F)** plus agentic (G) and startup-program (H) questions — Q1–Q27 plus conditional prompts. The default flow is the **Assumption-Sheet Wizard**: values extracted from discovery and documented defaults are presented in a single confirm-or-edit sheet (with the design consequence of each assumption), and only the **essential questions** (typically 2–7) are asked directly. The full question-by-question flow remains available via **"ask me everything."** A standalone **AI-Only** flow exists for migrations that only move AI/LLM calls to Bedrock.

| File                  | Category                                  | Questions | Loaded When                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `clarify-global.md`   | A — Global/Strategic                      | Q1–Q7     | Always                                          |

## Step 0: Prior Run Check

Check `$MIGRATION_DIR/` for existing state:

**Case 1 — Completed preferences exist** (`preferences.json` present):

> "I found existing migration preferences from a previous run. Would you like to:"
>
> A) Re-use these preferences and skip questions
> B) Start fresh and re-answer all questions

- If A: Run Step 2 item 6 only (BigQuery detection) on current discovery artifacts. If `bigquery_present` is **true**, output the Step 4 **BigQuery / deferred analytics** advisory block once (even though questions are skipped), then skip to Validation Checklist with the existing `preferences.json`.
- If B: delete `preferences.json`, continue to Step 1.

**Case 2 — Draft preferences exist** (`preferences-draft.json` present, no `preferences.json`):

> "I found a partial set of answers from a previous session. Would you like to:"
>
> A) Resume from where you left off — I'll pick up the remaining questions
> B) Start fresh and re-answer all questions

- If A: load the draft. If `metadata.wizard_stage` is present, resume at that stage (`"sheet_pending"` → re-present the Assumption Sheet; `"essentials_pending"` → re-present unanswered essential questions). If the draft has the legacy `metadata.batches_completed` field instead (pre-wizard flow), tell the user the flow has changed and offer: keep answered values and continue with the wizard for the rest, or start fresh.
- If B: delete `preferences-draft.json`, continue to Step 1.

**Case 3 — No prior state**: Continue to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Read Inventory and Determine Migration Type

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/` and check which discovery outputs exist:

- `gcp-resource-inventory.json` + `gcp-resource-clusters.json` — infrastructure discovered
- `ai-workload-profile.json` — AI workloads detected
- `billing-profile.json` — billing data parsed

At least one discovery artifact must exist to proceed.

### Migration Type Detection

- **Full migration**: `gcp-resource-inventory.json` or `billing-profile.json` exists (may also have `ai-workload-profile.json`)
- **AI-only migration**: ONLY `ai-workload-profile.json` exists (no infrastructure or billing artifacts)

**If AI-only**: Read `clarify-ai-only.md` NOW and follow that flow. Skip all remaining steps below.

> **HARD GATE — AI-Only Path:** You MUST read `clarify-ai-only.md` before presenting any questions. The question text, answer options, and interpretation rules are ONLY in that file — they are NOT in this file. Do NOT fabricate questions from the summaries above.

### Discovery Summary

Present a discovery summary:

**If `gcp-resource-inventory.json` exists:**

> **Infrastructure discovered:** [total resources] GCP resources across [cluster count] clusters
> **Top resource types:** [list top 3–5 types]

**If `ai-workload-profile.json` exists:**

> **AI workloads detected:** [from `models[].model_id`]
> **Capabilities in use:** [from `integration.capabilities_summary` where true]
> **Integration pattern:** [from `integration.pattern`] via [from `integration.primary_sdk`]

**If `billing-profile.json` exists:**

> **Monthly GCP spend:** $[total_monthly_spend]
> **Top services by cost:** [top 3–5 from billing data]

---

## Step 1.5: Fast-Path Gate (Simple Stacks)

**After presenting the Discovery Summary**, check `$MIGRATION_DIR/migration-preview.json` for fast-path eligibility:

```
IF migration-preview.json exists
   AND eligible_for_clarify_fast_path == true
THEN offer infra fast-path (3 questions)
ELSE IF eligible_for_clarify_simple_path == true
THEN offer simple hybrid path (~6 questions)
ELSE proceed to Step 2 (Assumption-Sheet Wizard)
```

### Infra fast-path (no AI)

**If `eligible_for_clarify_fast_path`**, present this offer before any questions:

> "Your stack looks straightforward — [primary_resource_count] resource(s), no database, no AI detected.
>
> Want to use smart defaults and answer just 3 questions?
>
> **[Yes — 3 questions]** / **[No — ask me everything]**"

**If user chooses Yes:**

1. Ask only: **Q1** (region), **Q2** (compliance), **Q7** (maintenance window) — from `clarify-global.md`.
2. Apply documented defaults for ALL other questions. Record each in `metadata.questions_defaulted`.
3. Still run the BigQuery advisory if `bigquery_present` is true.
4. Write `preferences.json` with `metadata.clarify_mode: "fast_path"`. Skip Steps 2–4.

### Simple hybrid path (simple infra + lightweight AI)

**If `eligible_for_clarify_simple_path`**, present:

> "Your stack looks straightforward with lightweight AI ([model IDs from profile]) — no agentic framework detected.
>
> Want a short question set (~6 questions) instead of the full flow? I'll use discovery for region, database sizing, and model detection.
>
> **[Yes — short path]** / **[No — ask me everything]**"

**If user chooses Yes:**

1. Run **Step 2 extraction** (mandatory — do not skip).
2. Run **Step 2.5 Assumption Sheet** (mandatory — wait for user response).
3. Ask only questions **not** resolved by extraction (after any user corrections):
   - **Q2** (compliance) — always ask
   - **Q7** (maintenance window) — always ask
   - **Q16** (AI priority) — from `clarify-ai.md`
   - **Q21** (AI latency) — from `clarify-ai.md`
   - **Q3** (GCP spend) — only if billing did not extract it
   - **Q1** (region) — only if region extraction ambiguous (multiple GCP regions)
4. Apply documented defaults for all other unanswered questions. Record in `metadata.questions_defaulted`.
5. Write `preferences.json` with `metadata.clarify_mode: "simple_hybrid"`. Skip Step 4 — go to Category E opt-in (if applicable) then Step 5.

**Agentic hard block:** If `agentic_profile.is_agentic == true`, **never offer** infra fast-path or simple hybrid path. Agentic workloads require Q23–Q26 (asked as essential questions in the wizard).

**If user chooses No, or neither path is eligible:** Continue to Step 2 (the wizard is the default full flow).

---

## Step 2: Extract Known Information

Before generating the Assumption Sheet, scan the inventory to extract values that are already known:

1. **GCP regions** — Extract all GCP regions from the inventory. Map to the closest AWS region as a suggested default for Q1.
2. **Resource types present** — Build a set of resource types: compute (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, GKE, GCE), database (Cloud SQL, Spanner, Memorystore), storage (Cloud Storage), messaging (Pub/Sub).
3. **Billing SKUs** — If `billing-profile.json` exists, check if any SKU reveals storage class, HA configuration, or other answerable questions.
4. **Billing-only mode** — If `billing-profile.json` exists and `gcp-resource-inventory.json` does NOT exist, check `billing-profile.json → services[]` for Category B question matching.
5. **AI framework detection** — If `ai-workload-profile.json` exists, check `integration.gateway_type` and `integration.frameworks` for auto-detection of Q14 answer.
6. **BigQuery / analytics warehouse** — Set `bigquery_present` to **true** if **any** of: (a) a resource in `gcp-resource-inventory.json` has `gcp_type` (or equivalent type field) starting with `google_bigquery_`; (b) `billing-profile.json` lists a service/SKU that clearly indicates **BigQuery** (e.g., service name or SKU contains `BigQuery`). Otherwise `bigquery_present` is **false**.
7. **Database size auto-detect (Q13b)** — For each `google_sql_database_instance`, read `config.disk_size`, `config.disk_size_gb`, or `gcp_config.disk_size_gb`. Map to Q13b band and **resolve Q13b** when unambiguous:

| Disk size (GB) | `db_size` value | Resolve Q13b?                  |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| < 10           | `"<10GB"`       | Yes — `chosen_by: "extracted"` |
| 10 – 99        | `"10-100GB"`    | Yes — `chosen_by: "extracted"` |
| 100 – 499      | `"100-500GB"`   | Yes — `chosen_by: "extracted"` |
| ≥ 500          | `">500GB"`      | Yes — `chosen_by: "extracted"` |

If multiple instances disagree, mark Q13b as an essential question. Record in `metadata.inventory_clarifications.db_size_gb` when extracted.

1. **Q6 from Cloud SQL HA** — For each `google_sql_database_instance`, read `availability_type` (or `config.availability_type`):

| GCP value  | `availability` extracted |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `ZONAL`    | `"single-az"`            |
| `REGIONAL` | `"multi-az"`             |

Resolve Q6 only when **all** Cloud SQL PostgreSQL/MySQL instances agree on the same mapped value. **`multi-az-ha` and `multi-region` are never auto-extracted** — those require Q6 user answers (Mission-Critical / Catastrophic). Cloud SQL `REGIONAL` maps to `multi-az` (RDS Multi-AZ), not `multi-az-ha` (Aurora). Record in `metadata.inventory_clarifications.cloud_sql_ha`. When `availability_type` is missing on any instance, or instances disagree, mark Q6 as an essential question.

1. **Q12/Q13 dev-tier defaults** — When **all** Cloud SQL instances match dev pattern (`db-f1-micro`, `db-g1-small`, or `tier` contains `micro`/`small` with `availability_type: ZONAL`), extract and **resolve Q12 and Q13**. When instances mix dev and prod tiers, do not extract — mark Q12 and Q13 as essential questions.

```
database_traffic: "steady" — chosen_by: "extracted"
db_io_workload: "low" — chosen_by: "extracted"
```

1. **Q3 GCP spend from billing** — If `billing-profile.json` exists, map `summary.total_monthly_spend` to spend band and **resolve Q3** when unambiguous:

| Monthly USD   | `gcp_monthly_spend` |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| < 1,000       | `"<$1K"`            |
| 1,000–4,999   | `"$1K-$5K"`         |
| 5,000–19,999  | `"$5K-$20K"`        |
| 20,000–99,999 | `"$20K-$100K"`      |
| ≥ 100,000     | `">$100K"`          |

1. **Q1 region extraction** — When inventory has a **single** GCP region among PRIMARY compute/database resources, map to closest AWS region and **resolve Q1** with `target_region` `chosen_by: "extracted"`. When multiple regions, suggest default but mark Q1 as an essential question.

1. **Q19 primary model** — If `ai-workload-profile.json` exists and `models[0].model_id` is set with confidence ≥ 0.8, map to Q19 answer and **resolve Q19**. Set `ai_model_baseline` with `chosen_by: "extracted"`.

1. **Q20 input modalities** — If `integration.capabilities_summary` exists:

| Signal                               | Extract                                                                           | Resolve Q20?                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vision: true`                       | `ai_vision: "vision-required"`                                                    | Yes                                                         |
| `image_generation: true` (no vision) | note in `ai_capabilities_required`; Q20 may still ask unless text-only path clear | Partial — resolve if only text + image gen via separate API |
| all false / text only                | `ai_vision: "text-only"`                                                          | Yes                                                         |

When `image_generation: true` and `vision: false`, set `ai_capabilities_required` derived from profile and resolve Q20 (image output is not vision _input_).

1. **Q9 WebSocket scan** — Only when application code was **actually analyzed**. Treat code as analyzed when **any** of: (a) `discover-app-code.md` ran and found source files; (b) `ai-workload-profile.json` → `metadata.sources_analyzed.application_code == true`; (c) a companion app directory was scanned. Scan for WebSocket usage: `websocket`, `WebSocket`, `socket.io`, `@nestjs/websockets`, FastAPI WebSocket, `ws` package imports. If code was analyzed and **no matches**, extract `websocket: false` and **resolve Q9**. If matches found, mark Q9 as an essential question to confirm.
   **If no application code was available** (Terraform-only workspace, no code discovery), do **NOT** extract Q9 — Q9 becomes a **proposed-default sheet row** (see Step 3 catalog), flagged so the user can correct it. Absence of a code scan is not evidence of no WebSockets.

1. **Q10 Cloud Run traffic** — If Cloud Run `min_instance_count` / `min_instances` > 0 in Terraform config, extract `cloud_run_traffic_pattern: "constant-24-7"` and resolve Q10. Otherwise Q10 becomes a proposed-default sheet row.

1. **Multi-instance Cloud SQL conflicts** — When multiple `google_sql_database_instance` resources **disagree** on values used for Q6, Q12/Q13, or Q13b (e.g. one ZONAL and one REGIONAL; mixed dev/prod tiers; different disk sizes):
   - Do **not** extract a single global value or propose a default for the affected question(s)
   - Record per-instance values in `metadata.inventory_clarifications.cloud_sql_instances[]` (address, `availability_type`, `tier`, `disk_size_gb`)
   - In Step 2.5, show a **per-instance breakdown** (see below) instead of a single summary row
   - Mark the affected question(s) as essential, or let the user pick a global posture during Step 2.5 confirmation

Record all extracted values in `metadata.inventory_clarifications` where applicable. Questions fully resolved by extraction appear as **Detected** rows on the Assumption Sheet with `chosen_by: "extracted"` and are listed in `metadata.questions_skipped_extracted`.

**After Step 2 completes, proceed to Step 3 (build the sheet), then Step 2.5 (present it). Do not ask any question before the sheet is confirmed.**

When a category file changes a default or adds an answer option, update the matching catalog row **in the same commit**. (Long-term, consequence strings may move into the category files to eliminate this duplication — see PR discussion.)

Every question in an **active** category gets exactly one disposition:

- **DETECTED** — Step 2 resolved it. Sheet row, `chosen_by: "extracted"`.
- **PROPOSED** — Documented default applied. Sheet row with consequence line, `chosen_by: "default"`.
- **ESSENTIAL** — No safe default. Asked directly in Step 4.
- **N/A** — Category or firing condition not met. Listed in `metadata.questions_skipped_not_applicable`.

**Multi-workload confirmation table** (`clarify-ai.md`, fires when `workloads[]` ≥ 2): unchanged — it runs during Step 4 as part of the AI essentials, after the sheet is confirmed. Its high-confidence rows behave like DETECTED sheet rows; medium/low-confidence rows behave like essential questions (max 2 per row).

### Early-Exit Rules

Apply before finalizing dispositions:

- **Q5 answered/overridden to "multi-cloud"** — Immediately record `compute: "eks"`. Q8 becomes N/A (early-exit).
- **Q10/Q11 N/A** — Cloud Run not present.
- **Q12/Q13/Q13b N/A** — Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL) not present in inventory.
- **Q8 N/A** — No GKE in inventory, or Q5 resolved to multi-cloud.
- **Q14 auto-detected** — If `integration.gateway_type` is non-null OR `integration.frameworks` is non-empty, DETECTED with `chosen_by: "extracted"`.

---

## Step 2.5: Assumption Sheet (Mandatory Gate)

**When to run:** Always in wizard mode, after Step 2 extraction and Step 3 disposition — whenever at least one row is DETECTED or PROPOSED.

**Skip Step 2.5 only when** every active question is ESSENTIAL or N/A (rare — e.g., empty discovery with Category A only). Proceed directly to Step 4.

**HARD GATE — do NOT ask any essential question until the user responds to this sheet.**

Present the sheet in two sections (omit rows for questions that are ESSENTIAL or N/A). Keep each consequence to one line — use the catalog wording from Step 3:

```
### Migration assumptions — confirm or correct

**Detected from your Terraform, billing, and code:**

| Setting | Value | Source | What it decides |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | --------------- |
| Region | us-west-2 (GCP us-west1) | gcp-resource-inventory.json | All AWS resources deploy here |
| Database availability | Single-AZ (Cloud SQL `ZONAL`) | Terraform `availability_type` | RDS single-AZ topology |
| Database size | 10–100 GB (allocated: 10 GB) | Terraform `disk_size` | pgcopydb migration tooling |
| DB traffic / I/O | Steady / Low (dev-tier `db-f1-micro`) | Terraform tier + ZONAL | gp3 storage, no replicas |
| Cloud SQL HA | Zonal (1 instance) | billing-profile.json | No Aurora Multi-AZ failover |
| AI model | gemini-2.5-flash | ai-workload-profile.json | Bedrock mapping baseline |

**Assumed (documented defaults — correct anything that's wrong):**

| Setting | Assumed value | Consequence if left as-is |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Multi-cloud | AWS-only | ECS Fargate eligible; multi-cloud would force EKS |
| Cloud Run spend | $100–$500/mo | Feeds migrate-vs-stay analysis |
| AI priority | Balanced | Sonnet-class default model |
| AI latency | Important (<2s) | Sonnet + streaming; <500ms would force Haiku/Nova |
| WebSockets | None (unverified — no code scan) | Standard ALB config |
| Activate credits | Unknown | Report includes both credit tiers |

Reply:
- **"looks good"** — I'll record these and ask only the [N] essential questions.
- To fix something, name the setting and value, e.g. **"availability: mission-critical"**, **"ai priority: cost"**, **"websockets: yes"**.
- **"ask me about [setting]"** — I'll ask the full question with all options for that item.
- **"ask me everything"** — discard all assumptions and run the full question-by-question flow.
```

**Computing [N]:** Count ESSENTIAL dispositions for all active categories, plus any rows converted to ESSENTIAL via user correction ("ask me about X"), plus conflict rows. Subtract any ESSENTIAL questions that were already answered by a user correction on the sheet (e.g., user said `"availability: mission-critical"` — Q6 no longer needs asking).

**Multi-instance Cloud SQL conflicts:** When instances disagree, replace the single-row summary with a per-instance table and keep the conflicting question ESSENTIAL until resolved:

```
| Instance | availability_type | tier | disk_size (GB) |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---- | -------------- |
| google_sql_database_instance.main | ZONAL | db-f1-micro | 10 |
| google_sql_database_instance.analytics | REGIONAL | db-n1-standard-4 | 100 |

These instances disagree on availability. Which posture should we use for the migration design?
A) Most conservative (highest HA) | B) Use [instance name] as primary | C) Ask me the full Q6 question
```

**Override handling** — when the user corrects a value (detected or assumed):

| User correction (examples)                       | Update constraint                                  | Re-ask?                   |

| `ai priority: cost` / `speed` / `quality`        | Set `ai_priority`, `chosen_by: "user"`             | No                        |

| "ask me about [setting]"                         | Convert that row to ESSENTIAL                      | Yes — full question       |
| Vague correction ("that's wrong")                | Convert that row to ESSENTIAL                      | Yes — full question       |

For each override: set `chosen_by: "user"` on the constraint (this removes the `source` field since it's no longer extracted/default). For extracted rows, also remove the question ID from `metadata.questions_skipped_extracted`; for assumed rows, remove it from `metadata.questions_defaulted`.

**When the user confirms ("looks good"):** no further action needed — the constraint objects already carry their `chosen_by` and `source` fields.

**"Ask me everything":** clear `questions_skipped_extracted` and `questions_defaulted`; set all previously extracted/assumed constraints to pending; set `metadata.clarify_mode: "full"` and run the **Legacy Full Flow** (see Step 4, Full Flow variant).

**Constraint `source` field:** When writing a constraint with `chosen_by: "extracted"` or `chosen_by: "default"`, include the `source` field on the constraint object itself:

- Extracted: raw provenance signal (e.g. `"terraform:availability_type=ZONAL"`, `"billing:region=us-west1"`, `"ai-profile:integration.pattern=direct_sdk"`)
- Default: `"default:<Qid>"` (e.g. `"default:Q16"`)

Omit `source` when `chosen_by` is `"user"` or `"derived"`. See constraint examples in Step 5.

After the user responds, write `preferences-draft.json` with all resolved values and `metadata.wizard_stage: "essentials_pending"`, then proceed to Step 4.

## Category E — Migration Posture (Disabled by Default)

_Fire when:_ User explicitly opts in.
_Default behavior when disabled:_ Apply conservative defaults — no HA upgrades, no right-sizing.

If the user opts in, present after the essentials:

### Q-E1 — Should we recommend upgrading Single-AZ to Multi-AZ where possible?

> A) Yes — upgrade to Multi-AZ for higher availability | B) No — keep current topology

Interpret → `ha_upgrade`: A → `true`, B → `false`. Default: B → `false`.

### Q-E2 — Should we use billing utilization data to right-size instance types?

> A) Yes — right-size based on utilization | B) No — match current capacity

Interpret → `right_sizing`: A → `true`, B → `false`. Default: B → `false`.

---

## Step 4: Ask the Essential Questions

**Prerequisite:** Step 2.5 sheet confirmation must be complete (user said "looks good" or finished correcting) before asking anything. Do not re-show the full sheet here unless the user asks for a recap.

> **COMPLIANCE SELF-CHECK (do this before emitting any question):** Verify both: (1) the Assumption Sheet was presented in a **previous turn**, and (2) the user has **responded** to it. If either is false, STOP — present the sheet and wait. Never combine the sheet and essential questions in a single message, and never ask a question that has a sheet row unless the user converted it via a correction or "ask me about X".

**BigQuery / deferred analytics (mandatory callout):** If Step 2 set `bigquery_present` to **true**, output this block **once**, **before** any questions (same turn as the essentials), then continue:

> **BigQuery / analytics warehouse:** Your discovery inputs include BigQuery. This skill **does not** select an AWS analytics or data-warehouse target (no Athena, Redshift, Glue, or EMR recommendation from the plugin). **Before** warehouse, data lake, SQL analytics, or BI cutover planning, engage your **AWS account team** and/or a **data analytics migration partner** to assess query patterns, data volumes, ETL/ELT, and downstream consumers. Design will mark these resources as **`Deferred — specialist engagement`**.

### Essentials Batch

Present ALL essential questions (from the Step 3 disposition, plus any rows converted by "ask me about X") as **one batch**, numbered from 1, with the question text, context, and options from the category files. Typical count: 2–7.

```
Just [N] questions we can't safely assume — then we're ready to design.
You can answer in shorthand ("1A 2C 3 skip"), describe answers in plain words,
skip individual ones (I'll use the documented default), or say
"use defaults for the rest."

Question 1: [Q2 text with context and options]
Question 2: [Q7 text with context and options]
...
```

**If the essential count exceeds 7** (e.g., agentic + billing gaps + conflicts), split into two batches — core (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q3.5/Q7 + conflicts) first, then AI/agentic (Q15, Q23–Q25, multi-workload confirmations) — and write `preferences-draft.json` between them (same schema as `preferences.json` plus `metadata.wizard_stage`).

**Wait for the user's response.** Do NOT proceed to Design without a response or an explicit "use defaults for the rest."

**"Use defaults for the rest" handling:** Apply documented defaults for all unanswered essential questions **except** those marked "never assumed" in the catalog when a safe default genuinely does not exist:

- Q2 defaults to A (none) — record `chosen_by: "default"` and add a report caveat that compliance was not confirmed.
- Q7 defaults to D (flexible).
- Q3 defaults to B ($1K–$5K) with a report caveat that spend was not confirmed.
- Q3.5, Q23–Q25, and unresolved multi-instance conflicts fall back to their documented defaults (Q3.5 → E; Q23 → framework-based; Q24 → session; Q25 → medium; conflicts → most conservative posture) with `chosen_by: "default"`.
  Then skip to Category E opt-in, then Step 5.

**Interpret answers** using the interpret rules in the category files. Apply early-exit rules triggered by answers (e.g., Q5 correction to multi-cloud → `compute: "eks"`, Q8 → N/A).

### Full Flow variant ("ask me everything")

When the user opted out of the wizard, run the progressive-batch flow: present ALL active questions (no dispositions) in up to three batches — Strategic (Q1–Q7, minus Q4), Infrastructure (Q8–Q13b + Category B), AI (Q14–Q27, Q23–Q26 only if agentic) — writing `preferences-draft.json` between batches with `metadata.batches_completed` / `metadata.batches_remaining` (values: `"strategic"`, `"infrastructure"`, `"ai"`). Per-question skip and "use defaults for the rest" behave as documented. Set `metadata.clarify_mode: "full"`.

### Category E Opt-In

After the essentials are answered (but before writing final `preferences.json`), offer Category E if `billing-profile.json` exists:

> "Would you also like HA upgrade and right-sizing recommendations based on your billing data? If not, I'll use conservative defaults (no upgrades, match current capacity)."

If user opts in, present Q-E1–Q-E2 (defined in **Category E — Migration Posture** above). Otherwise, apply Category E defaults (`ha_upgrade: false`, `right_sizing: false`).

## Step 5: Assemble and Write preferences.json

Assemble all resolved values — sheet confirmations, corrections, essential answers, and defaults — into the final `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json`. **Every constraint object MUST include `prompt` and `design_consequence`** per `references/shared/schema-preferences.md` (use the constraint catalog when the user did not see the verbatim question).

If `preferences-draft.json` exists, use it as the base — merge in the final answers, remove the draft-specific metadata fields (`draft`, `wizard_stage`, `batches_completed`, `batches_remaining`), and set `metadata.timestamp` to the current time. Write `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json`:

```json

### Schema Rules

Full schema and constraint catalog: `references/shared/schema-preferences.md`.

1. Every entry in `design_constraints`, `ai_constraints`, and `startup_constraints` (when present) is an object with **`value`**, **`chosen_by`**, **`prompt`**, and **`design_consequence`** fields. Optional **`question_id`** when mapped to the Q1–Q27 catalog. Optional **`source`** when `chosen_by` is `"extracted"` or `"default"`.
2. **`prompt`:** verbatim question from the category file when `chosen_by` is `"user"`; detection label when `"extracted"`; question + `" (default applied)"` when `"default"`; derivation label when `"derived"`.
3. **`design_consequence`:** one sentence from the category file's Recommendation Impact for the selected answer, or the catalog template in `schema-preferences.md` with `[value]` substituted.
4. `chosen_by` values: `"user"` (explicitly answered or corrected on the sheet), `"default"` (documented default applied — includes sheet-confirmed defaults and "I don't know" answers), `"extracted"` (inferred from inventory), `"derived"` (computed from combination of answers + detected capabilities).
5. **`source` field on constraints:** Every constraint with `chosen_by: "extracted"` or `chosen_by: "default"` MUST include a `source` field. Extracted: raw provenance signal (prefix `terraform:`, `billing:`, `code:`, `inventory:`, `ai-profile:`, or artifact filename). Default: `"default:<Qid>"`. Omit `source` for `"user"` and `"derived"`. Report generation uses `source` prefixed `default:` to flag unverified assumptions.
6. Only write a key to `design_constraints` / `ai_constraints` if the answer produces a constraint. Absent keys mean "no constraint — Design decides."
7. Do not write null values. Do not omit `prompt` or `design_consequence` on any written constraint.
8. For billing-source inventories, `metadata.inventory_clarifications` records Category B answers.
9. `metadata.questions_skipped_early_exit` records questions skipped due to early-exit logic (e.g., Q8 skipped because Q5=multi-cloud).
10. `metadata.questions_skipped_extracted` records questions resolved because inventory already provided the answer.
11. `metadata.questions_defaulted` records questions resolved by documented default — whether sheet-confirmed (wizard) or skipped (full flow / "use defaults").
12. `metadata.questions_skipped_not_applicable` records questions skipped because the relevant service wasn't in the inventory or their firing condition wasn't met.
13. `ai_constraints` section is present ONLY if Category F fired. Omit entirely if no AI artifacts exist.
14. `ai_constraints.ai_capabilities_required` is the UNION of detected capabilities from `ai-workload-profile.json` + critical feature from Q17 + vision from Q20. `chosen_by` is `"derived"`.
15. `ai_constraints.ai_framework` is an array (Q14 is select-all-that-apply). If auto-detected, `chosen_by` is `"extracted"` with `source`.
16. `metadata.clarify_mode` is one of `"wizard"`, `"full"`, `"fast_path"`, `"simple_hybrid"`.

After writing `preferences.json`, delete `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences-draft.json` if it exists.

## Defaults Table

Documented defaults for every question. Used by: PROPOSED sheet rows (wizard), per-question skips, "use defaults for the rest", and the fast paths.

## Validation Checklist

Before handing off to Design:

- [ ] In wizard mode, the Step 2.5 Assumption Sheet was shown (detected + assumed sections) and the user responded before any essential question was asked
- [ ] Every constraint with `chosen_by: "extracted"` or `chosen_by: "default"` has a `source` field with the correct prefix (`terraform:`, `billing:`, `inventory:`, `ai-profile:`, or `default:<Qid>`)
- [ ] Essential questions (Q2, Q7, and conditional Q1/Q3/Q3.5/Q15/Q23–Q25/conflicts) were asked, answered, or explicitly defaulted via "use defaults for the rest"
- [ ] If `bigquery_present` was **true**, the Step 4 BigQuery specialist advisory was shown before questions — **or**, if Step 0 option A (reuse preferences), the same advisory was shown after BigQuery detection
- [ ] `preferences.json` written to `$MIGRATION_DIR/`
- [ ] `design_constraints.target_region` is populated with `value` and `chosen_by`
- [ ] `design_constraints.availability` is populated when Cloud SQL PostgreSQL/MySQL is in inventory (asked, extracted, or defaulted — Design must not run with absent/null availability)
- [ ] Only keys with non-null values are present in `design_constraints`
- [ ] Every entry in `design_constraints` and `ai_constraints` has `value` and `chosen_by` fields
- [ ] Config gap answers recorded in `metadata.inventory_clarifications` (billing mode only)
- [ ] Early-exit skips recorded in `metadata.questions_skipped_early_exit`
- [ ] `ai_constraints` section present ONLY if Category F fired
- [ ] If Category F fired, `ai_constraints.ai_framework` is populated (from detection or Q14)
- [ ] If Category F fired, `ai_capabilities_required` is derived from detection + Q17 + Q20
- [ ] `ai_constraints.ai_framework` is an array (Q14 is multi-select)
- [ ] Output is valid JSON
- [ ] `preferences-draft.json` has been deleted (if it existed)
- [ ] `metadata.clarify_mode` is set to `"wizard"`, `"full"`, `"fast_path"`, or `"simple_hybrid"`

## Completion Handoff Gate (Fail Closed)

Load `shared/handoff-gates.md`. **Re-read from disk** before checking.

**Re-entry guard:** If `aws-design.json` (or `aws-design-ai.json` / `aws-design-billing.json`) exists and `phases.design` is `"completed"`: STOP unless the user explicitly confirms re-running Clarify. Emit `GATE_FAIL | phase=clarify | field=aws-design.json | reason=stale_downstream`.

**Checks (all must PASS):**

1. `preferences.json` exists and parses as JSON.
2. Step 5 validation checklist items all pass (including `metadata.clarify_mode`).
3. If `gcp-resource-inventory.json` contains `google_sql_database_instance` → `design_constraints.availability.value` is set (non-null, non-empty).
4. If `metadata.clarify_mode` is `"wizard"` → at least one constraint has a `source` field OR every active question was essential.
5. **No sheet/question mixing:** `metadata.questions_asked` contains no question ID that also appears in `metadata.questions_skipped_extracted` or `metadata.questions_defaulted`. (A question may move between lists only if the user converted its sheet row — in which case the override handling moved it to `questions_asked`.)

**On any FAIL:** Emit `GATE_FAIL | phase=clarify | field=<path> | reason=missing`. **Do NOT modify artifacts to pass the gate.** **Do NOT update `.phase-status.json`.** Tell the user to answer the missing question or re-run Clarify.

**On PASS:** Emit `HANDOFF_OK | phase=clarify | artifacts=preferences.json`.

## Step 6: Update Phase Status

Only after `HANDOFF_OK`. In the **same turn** as the output message below, use the Phase Status Update Protocol (Write tool) to write `.phase-status.json` with `phases.clarify` set to `"completed"`.

Output to user: "Clarification complete. Proceeding to Phase 3: Design AWS Architecture."

## Scope Boundary

**This phase covers requirements gathering ONLY.**

FORBIDDEN — Do NOT include ANY of:

- Detailed AWS architecture or service configurations
- Code migration examples or SDK snippets
- Detailed cost calculations
- Migration timelines or execution plans
- Terraform generation

**Your ONLY job: Understand what the user needs. Nothing else.**
