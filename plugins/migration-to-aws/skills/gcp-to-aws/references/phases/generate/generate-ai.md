# Generate Phase: AI Migration Plan

> Loaded by generate.md when estimation-ai.json exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Prerequisites

Read from `$MIGRATION_DIR/`:

- `aws-design-ai.json` (REQUIRED) — AI architecture design from Phase 3
- `estimation-ai.json` (REQUIRED) — AI cost estimates from Phase 4
- `ai-workload-profile.json` (REQUIRED) — AI workload profile from Phase 1
- `preferences.json` (REQUIRED) — User migration preferences from Phase 2

If any required file is missing: **STOP**. Output: "Missing required artifact: [filename]. Complete the prior phase that produces it."

## Part 1: Fast-Track Timeline

Check `preferences.json` → `ai_constraints.ai_framework` to determine timeline:

**Gateway users (1-3 days)** — `ai_framework` includes `llm_router`, `api_gateway`, `voice_platform`, or `framework`:

| Gateway Type                      | Migration Action                                              | Effort            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| LLM Router (LiteLLM, OpenRouter)  | Change model string to `bedrock/<model_id>`                   | 1 config line     |
| API Gateway (Kong, Apigee)        | Add Bedrock upstream + SigV4 signing                          | 1-2 config files  |
| Voice Platform (Vapi, Bland.ai)   | Check native Bedrock support, update dashboard                | Dashboard config  |
| Framework (LangChain, LlamaIndex) | Swap provider import (e.g., `ChatBedrock` for `ChatVertexAI`) | 1-5 lines of code |

**OpenAI SDK users via Mantle (hours to 1 day)** — `ai_framework` = `direct` AND `ai_source` = `openai` AND `migration_path` = `mantle`:

- Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables
- Update model string to Bedrock model ID
- Test in staging, validate responses
- No SDK changes, no new dependencies, no provider adapter needed

**Direct SDK users (1-3 weeks)** — `ai_framework` = `direct` AND (`ai_source` != `openai` OR `migration_path` = `converse`):

- **Week 1:** Enable Bedrock access, create IAM role, develop provider adapter with feature flag, unit test
- **Week 2:** Deploy to staging, run A/B comparison, measure latency/quality/cost, tune prompts
- **Week 3:** Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%), monitor, disable source provider after 48h stable

**Timeline adjustments:** Single model = shorter; multiple models = +1 week; framework integration = 1-2 weeks; custom inference pipeline = 3 weeks; if alongside infra migration, align with Weeks 3-8.

## Part 2: Step-by-Step Migration Guide

Based on `ai-workload-profile.json` → `integration.pattern` and `integration.languages`, generate SDK migration examples.

**Migration patterns to include (matched to detected language and source):**

| Source SDK         | Target                            | Key Change                                                                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI SDK         | Mantle OpenAI-compat              | Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` + model string (zero code changes)       |
| Vertex AI (Python) | boto3 Bedrock Converse API        | `GenerativeModel.generate_content()` → `bedrock.converse()`                       |
| Vertex AI (JS)     | @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime   | `model.generateContent()` → `client.send(new ConverseCommand())`                  |
| Vertex AI (Go)     | aws-sdk-go-v2 bedrockruntime      | `aiplatform` → `bedrockruntime.Converse()`                                        |
| Vertex AI (Java)   | AWS SDK BedrockRuntimeClient      | `GenerativeModel` → `BedrockRuntimeClient.converse()`                             |
| OpenAI SDK         | boto3 Bedrock Converse API        | `client.chat.completions.create()` → `bedrock.converse()` (if Mantle unavailable) |
| LiteLLM            | LiteLLM config change             | `model="gpt-4o"` → `model="bedrock/anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"`                  |
| LangChain          | langchain_aws                     | `ChatOpenAI`/`ChatVertexAI` → `ChatBedrock`                                       |
| LlamaIndex         | llama_index.llms.bedrock_converse | `Vertex` → `BedrockConverse`                                                      |

For each detected language and pattern, generate before/after code examples using actual model IDs from `aws-design-ai.json`.

Include streaming migration (`converse_stream`) if `capabilities_summary.streaming = true`.

Include embeddings migration (Titan Embeddings v2 via `invoke_model`) if `capabilities_summary.embeddings = true`.

---

## Part 3: Rollback Plan

**Feature flag strategy:** `AI_PROVIDER` env var controls routing:

- `vertex_ai` (default) — existing provider
- `bedrock` — switch to Bedrock
- `shadow` — send to both, return source response (for comparison)

**Rollback triggers:** quality below threshold, P95 latency > 2x baseline, error rate > 1% for 5 min, cost per request > 3x source.

**Rollback steps:** Set `AI_PROVIDER=vertex_ai` (instant), verify source traffic, monitor 1 hour, investigate, re-attempt.

---

## Part 4: Monitoring and Observability

**Key metrics and alert thresholds:**

| Metric            | Alert Threshold                | Severity |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| Error rate        | > 5% for 2 min → auto-rollback | Critical |
| Latency P95       | > 3x baseline for 5 min        | High     |
| Daily cost        | > 2x projected                 | Medium   |
| Token usage trend | > 120% of estimate             | Low      |
| Response quality  | < 90% of source score          | High     |

**Dashboard panels:** Request volume by provider, latency comparison (P50/P95/P99), error rates, token usage, cost tracking, quality scores.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `migration_plan.models_to_migrate` covers all models from `aws-design-ai.json`
- [ ] `step_by_step_guide.languages` matches `ai-workload-profile.json` languages
- [ ] `step_by_step_guide.files_to_modify` matches `aws-design-ai.json` code_migration
- [ ] `rollback_plan.mechanism` is `"feature_flag"`
- [ ] `success_criteria` covers quality, latency, and cost

## Generate Phase Integration

The parent orchestrator (`generate.md`) uses `generation-ai.json` to:

1. Gate Stage 2 artifact generation — `generate-artifacts-ai.md` requires this file
2. Provide AI migration context to `generate-artifacts-docs.md` for MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
3. Set phase completion status in `.phase-status.json`

## Part 7: Generate STARTUP_PROGRAMS.md

Always generate `$MIGRATION_DIR/STARTUP_PROGRAMS.md` when `preferences.json` contains `ai_monthly_spend` or `startup_program_status`. This artifact summarizes applicable AWS startup programs based on the user's detected spend and workload type.

**Content rules (all amounts from AWS official sources only):**

# AWS Startup Programs for Your Migration

Based on your migration profile, here are the AWS programs most relevant to you.
Credits apply to Bedrock usage (Claude, Llama, Nova, and other third-party models).

## AWS Activate Credits

AWS Activate provides promotional credits to offset AWS costs including Amazon Bedrock.
Apply at: https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits/

### Which tier applies to you

| Your situation                          | Package                     | Credits        | How to apply                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-funded, no VC/accelerator          | Activate Founders           | Up to $5,000   | Apply directly at aws.amazon.com/startups/credits — no Org ID needed   |
| VC or accelerator-backed (pre-Series B) | Activate Portfolio          | Up to $200,000 | Get your Activate Provider Org ID from your VC/accelerator, then apply |
| Ready to scale post-Activate-Portfolio  | AWS Credits for AI Startups | $200,000+      | Invite-only — talk with your AWS Account Manager                       |

**Activate eligibility (Founders & Portfolio):** Pre-Series B, founded in the last 10 years, AWS Account on Paid Tier Plan, and either new to Activate Credits or requesting more credits than previously received.
Credits expire within 1–2 years. Apply when you're ready to ramp up AWS usage.

[Conditional — only if ai_monthly_spend is "$2K-$10K" or ">$10K" AND agentic_profile.is_agentic == true:]

## AWS Generative AI Accelerator

An adjacent cohort program for agentic AI startups, distinct from the AWS Activate credits-hub funnel above. Highly selective. The 2025 global cohort selected 40 startups; consult the program page for the next cohort cycle.

- **Credits:** Up to $1,000,000 in AWS credits
- **Program:** 8-week cohort with mentorship, technical support, and go-to-market resources
- **Best for:** Startups with production agentic workloads and significant AI spend
- **Apply:** https://aws.amazon.com/startups/generative-ai/accelerator/

[End conditional]

## How to use credits during this migration

1. Apply for AWS Activate **before** running `terraform apply` — credits apply automatically to new charges
2. Credits cover eligible AWS services including Fargate, Aurora, S3, CloudWatch, and Bedrock models (both Amazon first-party and third-party foundation models)
3. **Credits do NOT cover upfront Savings Plans or Reserved Instance fees.** If the Estimate phase recommended Savings Plans for cost optimization, those commitments must be paid separately — credits apply to on-demand usage only.
4. Monitor your balance: AWS Console → Billing → Credits
5. Credits do not apply retroactively — apply before incurring costs

## Next steps

- [ ] Apply for AWS Activate at https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits/
- [ ] If VC/accelerator-backed: get your Activate Provider Org ID from your investor
- [ ] Apply credits before running terraform apply
      [- [ ] Apply for AWS Generative AI Accelerator: https://aws.amazon.com/startups/generative-ai/accelerator/ (if agentic and high spend)]
```

**Generation rules:**

- Always include the Activate section
- Only include the Generative AI Accelerator section when `ai_monthly_spend` is `"$2K-$10K"` or `">$10K"` AND `agentic_profile.is_agentic == true`
- If `startup_program_status == "has_credits"`: replace the "Apply for AWS Activate" steps with "You already have AWS Activate credits — ensure they are applied to your account before running terraform apply"
- Do NOT include any credit amounts not sourced from official AWS pages (aws.amazon.com)
- Do NOT reference MAP, IW Migrate, or ISV Workload Migration Program — these are enterprise/partner programs, not startup self-service paths
