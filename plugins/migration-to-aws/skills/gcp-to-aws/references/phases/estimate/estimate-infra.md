# Estimate Phase: Infrastructure Cost Analysis

> Loaded by estimate.md when aws-design.json exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Pricing Mode

The parent `estimate.md` determines pricing source before loading this file.

**Price lookup order for each AWS service in `aws-design.json`:**

1. **`shared/pricing-cache.md` (primary)** — Read once. **Before using, check staleness:** compute `days_since_cache = today − cache "Last updated" date`. If `days_since_cache > 30`, set `pricing_source: "cached_stale"` for all AI model prices and prepend a warning to the estimate output: "Pricing cache is more than 30 days old — AI model prices may have changed. Verify via the AWS Pricing MCP server or aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing." Infrastructure prices (Fargate, RDS, S3, etc.) remain reliable; only AI model prices need the stale flag. If `days_since_cache ≤ 30`, use the price directly and set `pricing_source: "cached"`.
2. **MCP with recipes (secondary)** — If a service is NOT in pricing-cache.md and MCP is available, use the Pricing Recipes table below. Set `pricing_source: "live"`.
3. **Cache after MCP failure** — If MCP was attempted but failed, and the service IS in the cache, use the cached price. Set `pricing_source: "cached_fallback"`.
4. **Unavailable** — If a service is NOT in the cache AND MCP failed, set `pricing_source: "unavailable"`. Add to `services_with_missing_fallback` and warn the user.

For typical migrations (Fargate, Aurora/RDS, Aurora Serverless v2, S3, ALB, NAT Gateway, Lambda, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, ElastiCache, DynamoDB), ALL prices are in `pricing-cache.md`. Zero MCP calls needed.

## Step 0: Validate Design Output

Before pricing queries, validate `aws-design.json`:

1. **File exists**: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Phase 3 (Design) not completed. Run Phase 3 first."
2. **Valid JSON**: If parse fails, **STOP**. Output: "Design file corrupted (invalid JSON). Re-run Phase 3."
3. **Required fields**:
   - `clusters` array is not empty: If empty, **STOP**. Output: "No clusters in design. Re-run Phase 3."
   - Each cluster has `resources` array: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Cluster [id] missing resources. Re-run Phase 3."
   - Each resource has `aws_service` field: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Resource [address] missing aws_service. Re-run Phase 3."
   - Each resource has `aws_config` field: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Resource [address] missing aws_config. Re-run Phase 3."

If all validations pass, proceed to Part 1.

## Pricing Recipes (MCP Fallback Only)

Only use these recipes when a service is NOT in `pricing-cache.md` and MCP is available.
Do NOT call get_pricing_service_codes, get_pricing_service_attributes, or get_pricing_attribute_values — go directly to get_pricing.

**Important notes on MCP filters:**

- **Fargate**: Use `productFamily=Compute`, NOT EC2-style filters (operatingSystem, tenancy, capacitystatus do not exist in AmazonECS)
- **Aurora (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: Use `deploymentOption=Single-AZ`. Aurora handles multi-AZ replication natively — there is no "Multi-AZ" pricing option for Aurora
- **Lambda**: Filter by `group=AWS-Lambda-Duration` for compute pricing, separate call with `group=AWS-Lambda-Requests` for request pricing
- **CloudWatch**: Filter by specific `usagetype=DataProcessing-Bytes` for log ingestion pricing (avoids pulling all vended log types)

**Batching rule:** If MCP calls are needed, group up to 4 requests in parallel per turn.

## Part 1: Calculate Current GCP Costs

Determine the current GCP monthly infrastructure costs. Use the best available source:

1. **`billing-profile.json` (preferred)** — Use actual billing data as the GCP baseline. Highest confidence (±5%).
2. **`gcp-resource-inventory.json` (fallback)** — Estimate costs from discovered resource configurations. Wider range (±20-30%).
3. **`preferences.json` → `gcp_monthly_spend`** — User-provided monthly spend from clarification.
4. **Ask the user** — If none of the above are available, ask: "I need your current GCP monthly spend to produce a meaningful cost comparison. What is your approximate GCP monthly infrastructure cost?" Use the user's answer. If the user declines or is unsure, present AWS costs without a GCP comparison and note: "GCP baseline unavailable — AWS costs shown without comparison."

Present the GCP baseline as a total and per-service breakdown, noting which source was used.

### CUD-Aware Baseline (when billing data available)

If `billing-profile.json` contains `commitments.has_active_cuds == true`:

1. **Use list price as the GCP baseline**: The `services[].monthly_cost` values already use list price (commitment fee rows excluded by discover phase). Use `cost_basis.total_at_list` as the total GCP baseline for comparison.
2. **Do not include commitment fees in workload costs**: Commitment fee rows are billing artifacts with no AWS equivalent — they are already excluded from `services[]`.
3. **Record the effective discount for Part 3**: Note `commitments.effective_discount_percent` — this is the customer's current GCP discount rate that will be compared against AWS Savings Plan rates.

This ensures the comparison is GCP list price vs. AWS on-demand (both uncommitted baselines), with commitment options presented separately as optimization opportunities.

---

## Part 2: Calculate Projected AWS Costs

**Security baseline coverage (always required):** Add a `security_baseline` entry to `projected_costs.breakdown` with `service: "AWS Security Baseline (Tier 1)"`, low/mid/high estimates of $3/$15/$30 per month, `accuracy: "±25%"`, and a `components` sub-object breaking down CloudTrail S3 storage (~$1.50/mo mid), GuardDuty (~~$13/mo mid after free trial), AWS Budgets ($0), and the free controls. If `preferences.json.compliance` contains any of `soc2`, `pci`, `hipaa`, `fedramp`, also add a sibling `security_baseline_compliance` entry with low/mid/high estimates of $3/$14/$25 per month, `accuracy: "±25%"`, `emission_reason` field citing the declared compliance values, and a `components` sub-object breaking down AWS Config (~$6/mo mid continuous), Config S3 storage (~~ $0.50/mo mid), Security Hub + FSBP (~$7/mo mid after free trial), and extra standards (free). Per-unit rates are grounded in the AWS Pricing API for us-east-1 as of 2026-05-04 (Config pricing effective 2025-09-01, Security Hub effective 2026-03-01). Cite source as `references/shared/pricing-cache.md § Security Baseline` or live `get_pricing` calls for `AmazonGuardDuty`, `AWSConfig`, and `AWSSecurityHub` service codes. Both line items are added as flat additives to each tier total (Premium/Balanced/Optimized) rather than being tier-dependent.

For each service in `aws-design.json`, calculate monthly cost using rates from `pricing-cache.md`. Track `pricing_source` per service.

**Secret Manager coverage (mandatory):** If any mapped resource has `gcp_type` of `google_secret_manager_secret` or `google_secret_manager_secret_version`, ensure an `aws_service` entry for **Secrets Manager** is present in the estimate breakdown. Do not collapse this into a generic "supporting" line item.

**BigQuery / deferred analytics (mandatory):** For any resource where `aws_service` is exactly **`Deferred — specialist engagement`** OR `gcp_type` starts with `google_bigquery_`:

- **Do not** apply Athena, Redshift, Glue, or EMR rates as the plugin’s “projected” analytics stack.
- **Exclude** these resources from Premium / Balanced / Optimized **numeric totals** (or list them under a `deferred_services[]` / `excluded_from_totals` section in `estimation-infra.json` with reason: _pending specialist engagement_).
- In the user-facing summary, state that **AWS analytics costs are unknown** until the **AWS account team** and/or **data analytics migration partner** defines the target architecture.

Calculate 3 cost tiers to show the optimization range:

| Tier          | Description                             | Examples                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premium**   | Latest generation, highest availability | db.r6g instances, Fargate Spot disabled, Multi-AZ everything        |
| **Balanced**  | Standard generation, typical setup      | db.t4g instances, Fargate on-demand, Single-AZ where acceptable     |
| **Optimized** | Cost-minimized with trade-offs          | db.t4g with reserved pricing, Fargate Spot 70%, S3-IA for cold data |

**Per-service calculation approach:**

| Domain                     | Formula                                                                               | Key inputs from aws-design.json                                               |

| Compute (Lambda)           | requests × request rate + (requests × duration × memory GB) × GB-second rate          | Estimated from usage patterns                                                 |

| Database (RDS)             | instance rate × 730 hours × instance count + storage GB × storage rate                | `aws_config.instance_class`, `aws_config.allocated_storage`                   |
| Storage (S3)               | GB × per-GB rate + request estimates                                                  | `aws_config.storage_gb` or source `gcp_config`                                |

| Security (Secrets Manager) | secrets_count × per-secret monthly rate + api_calls_10k × per-10K API rate            | `aws_config.secrets_count`, `aws_config.api_calls_10k` (or inferred defaults) |
| Supporting                 | Per-unit rates × quantities (secrets, log GB, metrics)                                | Inferred from service count                                                   |

Show calculation breakdown per service: rate × quantity = cost. Present all 3 tiers side-by-side.

## Part 2B: Observability Cost Estimation (CloudWatch)

GCP Cloud Operations includes a larger free tier for logging (50 GB/month), metrics (150M samples), alerting, and profiling. CloudWatch also has an always-free tier (5 GB logs, 10 custom metrics, 10 alarms, 1M API requests/month — see [AWS CloudWatch pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)), but allowances are smaller. This section estimates costs **above** those free-tier limits so observability is not a surprise post-migration.

**Relationship to Part 2 "Supporting" line item:** The observability entry produced by this section REPLACES any CloudWatch/log/metric portion that would otherwise appear in the "Supporting" row of Part 2. Do NOT include CloudWatch log ingestion, metrics, or alarms in the Supporting line item — they are fully covered here. Supporting retains only Secrets Manager and any non-observability per-unit charges.

### Pricing source

All rates from `pricing-cache.md § CloudWatch` and `§ X-Ray`. No MCP calls needed.

### Step 1: Determine log volume

**IF billing data IS available** (`billing-profile.json` exists):

Check for Cloud Logging line items:

- Look for `services[].sku` containing `Log Volume`, `Logging`, or `Cloud Logging`
- Extract volume in GiB from the SKU quantity/units field directly (preferred)
- OR derive from GCP cost: `gcp_logging_cost ÷ $0.50/GiB` (GCP's own list rate above free tier) = volume above free tier, then add 50 GiB for the free portion
- **Important:** Use GCP's own rate ($0.50/GiB) to reverse-engineer volume from GCP billing — not AWS rates. Apply AWS rates ($0.50/GB Standard) to the derived volume for the projected cost.
- Set `observability.log_volume_source: "billing"`

**IF billing data is NOT available:**

Use the per-service heuristic table to estimate monthly log volume:

| AWS Service (from aws-design.json) | Estimated log volume/month | Basis                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fargate task                       | 3 GB per task              | Container stdout/stderr, request logs                                                                                                                  |
| Lambda function                    | 0.2 GB per function        | Invocation logs at INFO level                                                                                                                          |
| RDS/Aurora instance                | 1 GB per instance          | Error log + slow query (audit log off)                                                                                                                 |
| RDS/Aurora instance (audit on)     | 8 GB per instance          | If source has `pgaudit.log`, `log_statement = 'all'`, `cloudsql.log_min_duration_statement`, or explicit audit/general log database flags in Terraform |
| ALB                                | 2 GB per load balancer     | Access logs (if enabled)                                                                                                                               |
| NAT Gateway                        | 1 GB per gateway           | Flow logs (if enabled)                                                                                                                                 |
| ElastiCache                        | 0.5 GB per node            | Slow log only                                                                                                                                          |

**RDS audit detection:** Check for database flags in the source `google_sql_database_instance` Terraform that indicate audit logging: `pgaudit.log`, `log_statement = 'all'`, `cloudsql.log_min_duration_statement`, or general/audit log flags for MySQL. Do NOT use `cloudsql.iam_authentication` as an audit proxy — IAM auth is access control, not audit logging.

Sum all applicable services. Set `observability.log_volume_source: "heuristic"`.

### Step 2: Determine custom metrics count

**IF billing data IS available:**

GCP Cloud Monitoring uses sample-based pricing ($0.10/1000 samples above 150M free) which does not map 1:1 to CloudWatch's per-metric-per-month pricing ($0.30/metric/month). Even with billing data, treat custom metrics as heuristic:

- Count `google_monitoring_alert_policy` resources in `gcp-resource-inventory.json` as a proxy for custom metric complexity
- Multiply alert policy count × 3 (typical metrics per alert: threshold metric + 2 related dimensions)
- Set `observability.metrics_source: "heuristic"` (even when billing data exists — GCP metric pricing is not cleanly convertible to CloudWatch's model)

**IF billing data is NOT available:**

Use the heuristic: `custom_metrics_count = (number of services in aws-design.json × 5) + (number of alert policies from source × 2)`

Default floor: 10 custom metrics.
Default ceiling for small startups: 50 custom metrics.

Set `observability.metrics_source: "heuristic"`.

### Step 2b: Determine alarm count

Count `google_monitoring_alert_policy` resources in `gcp-resource-inventory.json`.

- If count > 0: `alarm_count = count`
- If count is 0 or no alert policies found: `alarm_count = 5` (baseline — most teams set up basic health/error/latency alarms post-migration)

Set `observability.alarm_count_source: "inventory"` or `"default"`.

### Step 3: Determine tracing usage

**IF billing data IS available:**

Check for Cloud Trace line items:

- Extract span volume from SKU quantity/units field directly (preferred)
- OR derive from GCP cost: `gcp_trace_cost ÷ $0.20/million` (GCP's own list rate above 2.5M free tier) = millions of spans above free tier, then add 2.5M
- **Important:** Use GCP's rate ($0.20/M spans) to reverse-engineer volume from GCP billing. Apply AWS X-Ray rate ($5.00/M traces) to that volume for the projected cost.
- Set `observability.tracing_source: "billing"`

**IF billing data is NOT available:**

Check `gcp-resource-inventory.json` or application code for tracing libraries:

- If OpenTelemetry, `@google-cloud/trace-agent`, or `google.cloud.trace` imports detected: assume 1M spans/month (small app baseline)
- If no tracing signals: set `monthly_spans: 0` (tracing not in use; do not add X-Ray costs)

Set `observability.tracing_source: "heuristic"`.

### Step 4: Calculate CloudWatch costs

Default estimate uses Standard log class ($0.50/GB) for all logs. Infrequent Access ($0.25/GB) is an optimization opportunity surfaced in Step 6, not the baseline assumption.

**Always-free tier (apply before billing):** 5 GB logs (ingestion + archive combined), 10 custom metrics, 10 alarms, 1M API requests/month. Subtract these allowances from derived volumes before applying rates.

```
billable_log_gb       = max(0, monthly_log_gb - 5)
log_ingestion_cost    = billable_log_gb × $0.50
log_storage_cost      = billable_log_gb × $0.03 × retention_months (default: 1)
custom_metrics_cost   = max(0, custom_metrics_count - 10) × $0.30  (flat rate; valid for ≤10K metrics at startup scale)
alarms_cost           = max(0, alarm_count - 10) × $0.10
tracing_cost          = max(0, monthly_spans - 100_000) / 1_000_000 × $5.00  (honors X-Ray 100K/month free tier)
dashboard_cost        = max(0, dashboards - 3) × $3.00  (default: 0 — assume ≤3)

total_observability   = log_ingestion_cost + log_storage_cost + custom_metrics_cost + alarms_cost + tracing_cost + dashboard_cost
```

### Step 5: Add to projected costs

Add an `observability` entry to `projected_costs.breakdown`. This entry REPLACES any CloudWatch/log/metric portion in the "Supporting" row — do not double-count.

```json
{
  "service": "CloudWatch + X-Ray (Observability)",
  "low": <total × 0.7>,
  "mid": <total>,
  "high": <total × 1.5>,
  "accuracy": "±30%",
  "pricing_source": "cached",
  "components": {
    "log_ingestion": <log_ingestion_cost>,
    "log_storage": <log_storage_cost>,
    "custom_metrics": <custom_metrics_cost>,
    "alarms": <alarms_cost>,
    "tracing": <tracing_cost>
  },
  "volume_source": "<billing|heuristic>  (reflects log volume source — the largest cost component; metrics are always heuristic regardless of this field)",
  "note": "GCP Cloud Operations includes 50 GB/month free logging, free alerting, and free profiling. CloudWatch always-free tier includes 5 GB logs, 10 custom metrics, and 10 alarms per month. This estimate assumes workload volume above those limits (especially custom metrics). X-Ray tracing is more expensive than Cloud Trace at scale ($5/M vs $0.20/M). Actual costs depend on log verbosity and retention."
}
```

### Step 6: Surface GCP free tier delta in cost comparison

In Part 3 (Cost Comparison), if observability costs exceed $20/month, add a callout:

> **Observability cost note:** Your GCP Cloud Operations costs may appear low or zero due to generous free tiers (50 GB/month logging, 150M metric samples, free alerting). CloudWatch also has always-free allowances (5 GB logs, 10 metrics, 10 alarms), but they are narrower than GCP's. The CloudWatch estimate of $X/month reflects this workload **above those limits**. Consider:
>
> - Reducing log verbosity (WARN-only for production services) to lower ingestion costs
> - Using CloudWatch Logs Infrequent Access class for non-critical logs ($0.25/GB — 50% cheaper than Standard)
> - Evaluating sampling rate for X-Ray traces (10% sampling = 90% cost reduction)
> - CloudWatch Logs Insights for ad-hoc queries instead of always-on metric filters

### Estimation rules

- Do NOT emit observability costs as $0 without running Step 4 — apply CloudWatch always-free allowances first
- After free-tier adjustments, use the computed total (no artificial floor for small dev stacks within billable limits)
- If tracing is not detected in source, do NOT add X-Ray costs (don't upsell)
- Container Insights is NOT included by default — add only if source uses Cloud Monitoring with per-container metrics or if production-tier observability is required
- The observability line item REPLACES CloudWatch entries in the "Supporting" row — never double-count

---

## Part 3: Cost Comparison

Present a side-by-side comparison:

- GCP current monthly total (at list price)
- AWS Premium / Balanced / Optimized monthly totals
- Difference (savings or increase) per tier vs GCP
- Per-service breakdown for the Balanced tier

### Commitment Context (if CUDs detected)

If `billing-profile.json` has `commitments.has_active_cuds == true`, add a `commitment_context` section to the comparison:

- **GCP effective committed rate**: The customer currently pays `effective_discount_percent`% below list via CUDs
- **AWS equivalent**:
  - **Compute Savings Plans** (Fargate, Lambda, EC2): up to 66% vs On-Demand at maximum term/discount; typical 1-year no-upfront **20–40%**
  - **Database Savings Plans** (Aurora, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, etc.): up to **35%** (serverless) / up to **~20%** (provisioned instances), 1-year no-upfront
  - **RDS Reserved Instances** (alternative to Database Savings Plans on the same workload): up to **69%** (3-year All Upfront); locked to instance family/region — mutually exclusive with Database Savings Plans per workload
- **Fair comparison framing**: Present both an uncommitted comparison (GCP list vs. AWS on-demand) and a committed comparison (GCP net-of-CUD vs. AWS with 1yr commitments where applicable)
- **Migration timing note**: If the customer has active CUDs, note that CUD fees continue regardless of usage — migrating mid-commitment means paying both GCP CUD fees and AWS costs until the CUD term expires. For **Cloud Run → Fargate** or **GKE → Fargate** (re-platform) workloads, recommend establishing a 30–90 day AWS compute baseline before purchasing Compute Savings Plans (see Part 6).

Include in `estimation-infra.json` under `cost_comparison`:

```json
"commitment_context": {
  "gcp_has_active_cuds": true,
  "gcp_effective_discount_percent": 8.2,
  "gcp_monthly_at_list": 2450.00,
  "gcp_monthly_net_of_discounts": 2280.00,
  "aws_compute_savings_plan_discount": "up to 66% (Fargate/Lambda/EC2; max term); typical 20-40% (1yr no-upfront)",
  "aws_database_savings_plan_discount": "up to 35% (serverless) / up to 20% (provisioned RDS/Aurora)",
  "aws_rds_reserved_instance_discount": "up to 69% (specific instance family, 3yr All Upfront)",
  "aws_1yr_savings_plan_typical_discount": "20-40%",
  "aws_3yr_savings_plan_typical_discount": "40-66%",
  "note": "GCP baseline uses list price for apples-to-apples comparison. Customer currently saves 8.2% via CUDs. AWS Savings Plans (compute + database) offer comparable or deeper discounts post-migration. Database Savings Plans and RDS Reserved Instances are mutually exclusive on the same workload. For Cloud Run → Fargate or GKE → Fargate (re-platform), commit Compute Savings Plans after establishing a 30-90 day AWS usage baseline."
}
```

If `commitments.has_active_cuds == false` or the section is absent, omit `commitment_context` from the output.

---

## Part 4: GCP Data Transfer Egress (Vendor Fees Only)

This section covers **GCP vendor/network charges** for outbound data during migration — not human labor or professional-services costs (those are never presented as dollar estimates by this advisor).

**Billing data check:** Before generating this section, check if `$MIGRATION_DIR/billing-profile.json` exists.

### IF billing data IS available (`billing-profile.json` exists):

**Data transfer** — egress fees from GCP during migration. GCP charges for outbound data transfer; volume depends on database sizes and storage to migrate. Use the billing data to estimate the volume of data that needs to move.

Set `billing_data_available: true` in the output `migration_cost_considerations` object.

### IF billing data is NOT available (`billing-profile.json` does not exist):

**Omit GCP data transfer fee estimates.** Without billing data, there is no grounding for egress projections. Instead, include only this note in the output:

Set `migration_cost_considerations` to:

```json
{
  "categories": [],
  "billing_data_available": false,
  "note": "Data transfer cost estimates require GCP billing data. Re-run discovery with a GCP billing export to see GCP egress fee projections."
}
```

In the user-facing summary, when billing data is missing, state: "GCP data transfer egress estimates require billing data. Provide a billing export and re-run discovery to see vendor egress projections."

---

## Part 5: ROI Analysis

Present the monthly and annual cost difference between GCP baseline and each AWS tier (Premium, Balanced, Optimized). This is the recurring savings (or increase) the customer can expect.

- If AWS is cheaper: present the monthly and annual savings for each tier
- If AWS is more expensive: state clearly and note that cost savings alone do not justify migration — operational benefits must be the driver

**Operational efficiency factors to highlight** (qualitative — do not assign dollar values):

- Reduction in operational overhead from managed services (Fargate vs self-managed, RDS vs self-hosted DB)
- Reduced on-call burden from AWS-managed HA, patching, and scaling
- Engineering time freed for product work instead of infrastructure maintenance

**Non-cost benefits to present:** operational efficiency, global reach, service breadth, enterprise integration, vendor diversification, scaling flexibility (auto-scaling, spot instances, savings plans).

**Note:** GCP data transfer egress fees (if estimated in Part 4) are **vendor** one-time charges excluded from recurring ROI calculations — not human migration costs.

---

## Part 6: Cost Optimization Opportunities

**Relationship to cost tiers:** Premium / Balanced / Optimized totals in Part 2 are **pricing scenarios** for the same design. The **Optimized** tier already assumes illustrative trade-offs (e.g. reserved DB pricing, Fargate Spot). Entries in `optimization_opportunities` are **incremental post-migration actions** beyond the Balanced on-demand baseline — do **not** add their savings on top of Optimized tier totals (which already embed assumptions).

Present applicable optimizations with estimated savings:

| Optimization                   | Savings Range                               | Applies To                                                                          | When                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Compute Savings Plans          | 20–66%                                      | Fargate, Lambda, EC2                                                                | Post-migration (after 30–90 day usage baseline) |
| Database Savings Plans         | Up to 35% (serverless) / ~20% (provisioned) | Aurora, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, DocumentDB, Neptune, Keyspaces, Timestream, DMS | Post-migration or after instance right-sizing   |
| RDS Reserved Instances         | Up to 69%                                   | RDS, Aurora (provisioned)                                                           | Post-migration (after architecture stabilizes)  |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering / S3-IA | 38–50%                                      | S3 storage                                                                          | During migration                                |
| Spot Instances                 | 60–90%                                      | Batch/non-critical EC2 workloads                                                    | If batch jobs exist                             |

For each applicable optimization:

- **Compute Savings Plans:** emit percent range and post-migration timing; **omit `savings_monthly`** unless 30+ days of AWS usage data exist — do not size commitments from GCP Cloud Run or GKE billing alone (see below).
- **Database Savings Plans / RDS RIs:** may include preliminary `savings_monthly` when the Design phase mapped a target instance class **and** projected monthly DB on-demand cost exceeds **$50/month**; otherwise percent-only guidance.
- **S3 / Spot:** calculate before/after monthly cost when quantities are known from design.

Cross-reference Clarify when available: `cloud_run_traffic_pattern = business-hours` strengthens post-migration baseline guidance for compute; `constant-24-7` allows slightly more confidence in floor sizing — still post-migration for Compute Savings Plans.

### Compute Savings Plans (Fargate / Lambda)

**Relevance to GCP migrations:**

| Source                                 | Fargate commitment sizing from GCP data?               | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cloud Run → Fargate**                | **Unreliable**                                         | Variable-priced, scales to zero, bills per-request. GCP billing does not map 1:1 to Fargate vCPU-hours.                                                                                                                                          |
| **GKE → Fargate** (re-platform to ECS) | **Unreliable for commitment; useful for sanity check** | Node pools are often 24/7 with known machine types — you can rough-estimate vCPU-hours from node count × machine type. But re-platforming changes task sizing, autoscaling, and bin-packing; do not purchase a Savings Plan from GCP data alone. |
| **GKE → EKS** (keep Kubernetes)        | **Partial**                                            | Compute Savings Plans apply to **EC2 worker nodes** or **EKS Fargate profiles**, not the EKS control plane fee (~$0.10/hr per cluster). Post-migration baseline still recommended after right-sizing.                                            |

**What Compute Savings Plans offer:**

- Up to **66%** savings on Fargate, Lambda, and EC2 vs On-Demand at maximum term/discount ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/compute-pricing/))
- Commitment measured in **$/hour** — not tied to specific instance types, regions, or services
- Applies automatically across EC2, Fargate, and Lambda regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS, or tenancy ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/faqs/))
- 1-year or 3-year terms; deeper discounts for longer terms and higher upfront payment

**Guidance for workloads migrating to Fargate (Cloud Run or GKE re-platform):**

The plugin SHALL present Compute Savings Plans as a **post-migration optimization** and SHALL NOT size a commitment from GCP billing data alone:

1. **Run on On-Demand for 30–90 days post-migration** to establish an AWS usage baseline
2. **Use AWS Cost Explorer Savings Plans Recommendations** — after 30+ days, Cost Explorer generates personalized recommendations based on actual hourly usage floor
3. **Commit to the usage floor, not the average** — cover minimum sustained usage; burst above the commitment bills at On-Demand with no penalty
4. **Consider rolling Savings Plans** — purchase smaller plans staggered quarterly to reduce risk if usage patterns change ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/how-can-i-use-rolling-savings-plans-to-reduce-commitment-risk/))

**Emit in `optimization_opportunities` when Fargate or Lambda is in `aws-design.json`:**

```json
{
  "opportunity": "Compute Savings Plans",
  "type": "compute_savings_plan",
  "target_services": ["Fargate", "Lambda"],
  "savings_percent": "20-66%",
  "savings_monthly": null,
  "commitment": "1-year or 3-year",
  "timing": "post-migration (after 30-90 days of usage data)",
  "implementation_effort": "low",
  "prerequisite": "Establish AWS compute usage baseline before committing",
  "description": "GCP compute billing (Cloud Run variable pricing or GKE re-platform to Fargate) makes pre-migration commitment sizing unreliable. GKE node pool sizing may sanity-check the floor but do not commit from GCP data alone. Use AWS Cost Explorer recommendations after migration to size the commitment to your actual usage floor.",

    "https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/faqs/"
  ]
}
```

### Database Savings Plans and Reserved Instances (Aurora / RDS)

**Relevance to GCP migrations:** Cloud SQL instances typically run 24/7 with a known instance size. Unlike Cloud Run, Cloud SQL usage translates well to AWS RDS/Aurora steady-state workloads — commitment sizing is more predictable from source configuration.

**What Database Savings Plans offer:**

- Up to **35%** on serverless deployments; up to **~20%** on provisioned RDS/Aurora instances ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-database-savings-plans-for-aws-databases/))
- **1-year term only**, no upfront payment required ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/12/database-savings-plans-savings/))
- Applies across eligible usage regardless of engine, instance family, size, deployment option, or Region
- **Mutually exclusive with RDS Reserved Instances on the same workload** — choose one discount model per database workload; you may use RIs on one workload and Database Savings Plans on another

**What RDS Reserved Instances offer (alternative):**

- Up to **69%** savings for 1-year or 3-year terms ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/reserved-instances/))
- Payment options: No Upfront (~30%), Partial Upfront (~36% 1yr), All Upfront (~42% 1yr); 3-year terms up to 69%
- Locked to specific instance family, size, and region — less flexible but deeper discounts than Database Savings Plans

**Guidance for Cloud SQL → Aurora/RDS migrations:**

When Cloud SQL maps to a prod-tier instance with **> $50/month** projected on-demand DB cost:

1. Map source instance to AWS instance class (from Design phase)
2. Present Database Savings Plan benefit — 1-year, up to 35% (serverless) or ~20% (provisioned), flexible engine/instance changes
3. Present RI alternative for deeper savings when instance family is stable for 1+ years
4. **Recommend Database Savings Plans over RIs for migrations** — post-migration right-sizing flexibility outweighs RI depth for most customers

For dev-tier databases (< $50/month on-demand), emit percent-only guidance without dollar `savings_monthly`.

**Emit in `optimization_opportunities` when RDS or Aurora is in `aws-design.json`:**

```json
{
  "opportunity": "Database Savings Plans",
  "type": "database_savings_plan",
  "target_services": ["Aurora", "RDS"],
  "savings_percent": "up to 35% (serverless) / up to 20% (provisioned)",
  "savings_monthly": 4.50,
  "commitment": "1-year no-upfront",
  "timing": "immediately post-migration or after instance right-sizing",
  "implementation_effort": "low",
  "prerequisite": "Confirm target instance class and expected steady-state usage; omit savings_monthly when DB on-demand < $50/month",
  "description": "Cloud SQL 24/7 usage is predictable. Database Savings Plans offer flexibility to change engines/instances post-migration. Mutually exclusive with RDS RIs on the same workload.",
  "alternative": {
    "opportunity": "RDS Reserved Instances",
    "type": "rds_reserved_instances",
    "savings_percent": "up to 69%",

## Part 7: Recommendation

Present 3 paths:

1. **Migrate with Optimizations (Best ROI)** — optimized service choices, monthly cost, projected annual savings
2. **Phased Migration (Lower Risk)** — cluster-by-cluster per design evaluation order, validate each before proceeding
3. **Stay on GCP (Lowest Cost)** — only if AWS is more expensive and costs are the sole metric

Include migrate/stay decision factors:

- **Migrate if:** operational efficiency matters, AWS-specific services needed, batch workloads (Spot savings), long-term AWS strategy, growing infrastructure
- **Stay if:** cost is the only metric and AWS is more expensive, team deeply experienced with GCP, no need for AWS-specific services

### Persist recommendation to estimation-infra.json

Part 7 MUST write the following `recommendation` block to `estimation-infra.json`. This is the single source of truth consumed by the HTML migration report (Section 0) and the Estimate chat summary. Do NOT duplicate this logic elsewhere.

```json
"recommendation": {
  "path": "migrate_optimized|migrate_phased|stay",
  "path_label": "Migrate with Optimizations|Phased Migration|Stay on GCP",
  "roi_justification": "string — one-sentence ROI case from Part 5",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "migrate_if": [
    "string — each factor that favors migration for THIS stack"
  ],
  "stay_if": [
    "string — each factor that favors staying for THIS stack"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "string — actionable items from Part 7"
  ]
}
```

**Enum normalization for `path`:**

| Scenario                                     | `path` value          | `path_label` (display)         |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| AWS cheaper or operational benefits justify  | `"migrate_optimized"` | `"Migrate with Optimizations"` |
| Complex stack, phase-by-phase safer          | `"migrate_phased"`    | `"Phased Migration"`           |
| AWS more expensive AND costs are sole metric | `"stay"`              | `"Stay on GCP"`                |

Use `path` for machine consumption; `path_label` for display in report and chat.

**Required fields:** `path`, `path_label`, `confidence`, `migrate_if` (non-empty array), `stay_if` (non-empty array), `next_steps` (non-empty array). `roi_justification` is optional (omit when `path` is `"stay"`).

Tailor `migrate_if` and `stay_if` to THIS stack (deferred services, AI cost delta, CUD lock-in, team GCP depth, etc.) — do not copy the generic Part 7 bullets verbatim unless they apply.

**BigQuery / deferred analytics:** Exclude from TCO totals and mark **`Deferred — specialist engagement`** in design, but **do not** treat BigQuery as a default reason to stay on GCP. Use `migrate_if` bullets such as engaging the AWS account team for analytics **in parallel** with phased infra migration. Use `stay_if` for BigQuery only when the user **must** cut over analytics in the **same window** as app infra and cannot run a phased analytics track with specialist planning.

## Output

Read `shared/schema-estimate-infra.md` for the `estimation-infra.json` schema and validation checklist, then write `estimation-infra.json` to `$MIGRATION_DIR/`.

## Completion Handoff Gate (Fail Closed)

Load `shared/handoff-gates.md`. **Re-read from disk** before checking.

Before returning control to `estimate.md`, require:

- `estimation-infra.json` exists and passes `shared/schema-estimate-infra.md` validation.
- `recommendation.path` is one of `migrate_optimized`, `migrate_phased`, or `stay`
- `recommendation.path_label` is non-empty
- `recommendation.migrate_if` and `recommendation.stay_if` are non-empty arrays (Part 7 MUST persist `recommendation`)

**On FAIL:** Emit `GATE_FAIL | phase=estimate | field=<path> | reason=missing`. **Do NOT patch `estimation-infra.json` to pass the gate.** STOP — do not return control to `estimate.md` for phase completion.

**On PASS:** Emit `HANDOFF_OK | phase=estimate | artifacts=estimation-infra.json` (parent `estimate.md` emits the combined handoff after all routes pass).

## Present Summary

After writing `estimation-infra.json`, present a concise summary to the user:

1. **Pricing source and accuracy**: State whether prices came from cache or live API, and the accuracy range (±5-10% for infrastructure from cache/live, ±15-25% if cache is stale). Example: "Estimates based on cached AWS pricing (2026-03-07), accuracy ±5-10%."
2. GCP baseline vs estimated AWS monthly cost (balanced tier) — one-line comparison
3. Three-tier table: **Premium**, **Balanced**, **Optimized** with estimated monthly costs. Under or beside each label, use the **short subtitles**: Premium — _Highest resilience / highest monthly estimate in this model_; Balanced — _Default scenario; compare GCP to this first_; Optimized — _Lower monthly estimate; reservations / Spot / storage trade-offs assumed_. Add a one-line **How to read**: three figures are **estimated monthly costs** for the same architecture (high → mid → low); **not** three Terraform stacks. When Terraform is generated later, it aligns with **Balanced**.
4. Per-service estimated monthly cost breakdown (balanced tier, 1 line per service)
5. **If billing data available**: Estimated GCP data transfer egress fees. **If billing data NOT available**: "Data transfer cost estimates require GCP billing data."
6. Estimated monthly and annual savings (or increase) vs GCP per tier
7. Top 2-3 optimization opportunities with estimated savings amounts
8. **Recommendation:** `recommendation.path_label` with one-line ROI justification when present

**Cost labeling rule:** All dollar figures presented to the user MUST be labeled as "estimated monthly costs" or prefixed with "Est." — never present raw dollar amounts as if they are exact. This applies to chat output, report tables, and summary lines.

Keep it under 25 lines. The user can ask for details or re-read `estimation-infra.json` at any time.

## Generate Phase Integration

The Generate phase (`generate.md`) uses `estimation-infra.json` as follows:

1. **`projected_costs.breakdown`** — Budget allocation per cluster migration phase
2. **`migration_cost_considerations`** — Data transfer egress cost estimates (if billing data available)
3. **`optimization_opportunities`** — Which optimizations to implement and when (some during initial migration, some post-migration)
4. **`cost_comparison`** — Set cost monitoring targets and alerts for each migrated cluster
5. **`recommendation`** — Migrate/stay guidance (`path`, `path_label`, `migrate_if`, `stay_if`, `next_steps`); consumed by HTML report Section 0
6. **Cost tier vs Terraform** — Generated **`terraform/`** implements **one** baseline aligned with the **Balanced** scenario; **Premium** and **Optimized** are **estimate-only** bands unless the user changes IaC. See `generate-artifacts-infra.md` (`terraform/README.md`, `migration_summary` output).

The generated artifacts reference the cost estimates to set per-cluster cost monitoring thresholds and validate that actual AWS spend aligns with projections after each cluster migration.
