# Validate Migration Report (Post-Write)

> **Read-only validation.** Run immediately after writing `migration-report.html` in `generate-artifacts-report.md` Step 4. Do NOT modify JSON artifacts.

**Decision mode:** the same script validates `decision-report.html` (written at the post-Estimate Decision gate, choice A — see `report-decision-core.md`) with `--mode decision`: required sections become the exec set + `decision-cta`, and any `appendix-*` section fails (no Generate artifacts exist at decision time). All other checks (TOC integrity, readability, verdict, baseline rules) apply unchanged. Full mode's contract and `REPORT_OK` output format are unaffected.

If validation fails: **rename** the incomplete HTML to `migration-report.incomplete.html` (default — preserves output for inspection), emit failures to the user, and retry report generation. Do **not** delete unless the user asks. The Generate phase still completes (report is optional), but the user MUST see `REPORT_FAIL` — never silently accept a stub report.

---

## How to run (deterministic script path)

The validator script ships with the plugin at:

`migrate/plugins/migration-to-aws/scripts/validate-migration-report.py`

```bash
python3 "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-migration-report.py" \
  "$MIGRATION_DIR/migration-report.html" \
  --estimation-infra "$MIGRATION_DIR/estimation-infra.json" \
  --estimation-ai "$MIGRATION_DIR/estimation-ai.json"
```

Pass `--estimation-infra` / `--estimation-ai` only when those files exist. Flags:

- `--migration-dir "$MIGRATION_DIR"` — enables **fixture-bleed detection** on real runs (the reference canary ID must not appear, and the report's migration ID must match the run folder). Omit it when validating the reference fixture itself.
- `--no-require-toc` — skip the TOC requirement (for minimal test fixtures only).
- `--no-readability` — skip the customer-facing readability checks (escape hatch; not for normal Generate runs).

### Check the exit code — do not pattern-match on stdout text alone

The agent must branch on the shell **exit code** of the validator command, not just on whether `REPORT_OK` or `REPORT_FAIL` appears in the text. If `python3` is not on `$PATH` (or the script path is wrong), the shell returns exit code `127` ("command not found") with neither string in its output — parsing for `REPORT_OK`/`REPORT_FAIL` alone leaves that case undefined and produces unpredictable agent behavior.

Handle exactly three outcomes:

| Exit code                                                                                | Meaning                                                                   | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| anything else (e.g. `127` command not found, `126` permission denied, `2` bad arguments) | **Validator did not run** — this is neither `REPORT_OK` nor `REPORT_FAIL` | Do **not** rename or delete the HTML file. Do **not** claim the report passed or failed validation. Tell the user: "Could not run the report validator (`<exit code and stderr>`) — install Python 3 (`python3 --version` to check) or verify `$PLUGIN_ROOT` is correct, then re-run validation manually." The Generate phase may still complete with the unvalidated report, but the user must be told validation did not occur — never silently treat a missing interpreter as a pass. |

## Scope

This validator is a **structural + content + visual-readability completeness
gate**. The visual contract is intentionally capability-based rather than
pixel-perfect: reports must preserve the shared contrasting page shell,
bordered section cards, responsive metric grid, mobile breakpoint, keyboard
focus state, and print rules from `generate-artifacts-report.md`. Colors and
small spacing refinements may evolve without changing the validator.

The validator does **not** verify that every dollar figure in the HTML matches
estimation JSON. Self-check item for numeric accuracy in
`generate-artifacts-report.md` remains a manual step.
`REPORT_OK | structure=complete` means the report is ready for human review,
not financially audited.

`--no-require-toc` also bypasses the visual-shell contract for deliberately
minimal unit fixtures. It is not an escape hatch for normal generated full or
decision reports.

| 19 | Activate action link               | If `decision-summary` mentions AWS Activate, that section includes a clickable link to `https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits/`; an appendix-only link is insufficient                                                                                                                      |

Checks 10, 11, and 15 scan the `<body>` with `<style>` stripped, so CSS class names (e.g. `.rubric`) and selectors never trip them. The same readability scan rejects customer-facing "TCO" because modeled cloud charges do not include staffing or operating labor. Check 15 scopes to executive-flow sections only — appendices may carry artifact filenames and resource IDs by design. Disable checks 10, 11, and 15 with `--no-readability` only for non-customer fixtures. Check 14 is inert without `--migration-dir`, so validating the reference fixture (which legitimately contains the canary ID) never self-trips. Checks 16–17 apply whenever the corresponding sections/headings exist.

## Section IDs are stable anchors, not placement hints

Some `appendix-*` IDs render in the executive flow on purpose — `appendix-assumptions` especially, since exclusions and pricing confidence are executive-relevant. **Do not rename IDs to match position**; the validator and TOC key on them. `appendix-security` and `appendix-security-gap` render in the appendix and so their IDs match placement; `exec-security-teaser` is the compact executive summary that links down to them.

## Output

**Pass:**

```
REPORT_OK | structure=complete | sections=9/9 | optional=exec-tco,exec-security-teaser,appendix-ai | note=verify dollar figures against estimation JSON before sign-off
```

**Fail:**

```
REPORT_FAIL | migration-report.html
  - readability: internal scoring trace ("Rubric:") — drop it or gate behind a <details> "Why this mapping?" block
  - readability: literal "Section 0" heading — drop numeric "Section N" prefixes from customer-facing headings; let the table of contents carry structure
  - TOC broken link href="#decision" — no matching <section id="decision">
```

## Reference fixture

`migrate/plugins/migration-to-aws/fixtures/migration-report-reference.html` — TOC `href` values match `section id` attributes exactly, security detail lives in the appendix behind a teaser, mapping rationale is in `<details>` blocks, and headings carry no numbers. Validate with the full-contract command above.
