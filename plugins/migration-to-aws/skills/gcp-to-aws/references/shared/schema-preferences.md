## Wrapper object (required fields)

Every key in `design_constraints`, `ai_constraints`, and `startup_constraints` (when present) MUST be an object with:

| Field                | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`              | any    | yes      | Interpreted constraint value (same types as before)                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `chosen_by`          | string | yes      | `"user"` \| `"default"` \| `"extracted"` \| `"derived"`                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `prompt`             | string | yes      | Question shown to the user, or a short detection label when skipped                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `design_consequence` | string | yes      | One sentence: how this choice shaped the AWS design, estimate, or plan                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `question_id`        | string | no       | Catalog ID (`Q1`–`Q27`) when mapped; omit for derived unions                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `source`             | string | no       | Raw provenance signal. Required when `chosen_by` is `"extracted"` (prefix `terraform:`, `billing:`, `code:`, `inventory:`, `ai-profile:`, or artifact filename) or `"default"` (`"default:<Qid>"`). Omit for `"user"` and `"derived"`. |

**Do not write null values.** Omit keys that produce no constraint.

### `prompt` by `chosen_by`

| `chosen_by` | `prompt` content                                                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`      | Verbatim question text from the active category file (blockquote body, without answer options) |
| `extracted` | Detection label, e.g. `"Detected: Cloud SQL ZONAL → single-AZ availability"`                   |
| `default`   | Question text + `" (default applied)"`                                                         |
| `derived`   | `"Derived from detected capabilities and your answers"` or the specific derivation rule        |

### `design_consequence`

Use the **Recommendation Impact** row for the selected answer from the category file when the user answered. For extracted/default/derived, use the catalog below or synthesize one sentence tied to the actual `value`.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "metadata": { "...": "..." },
  "design_constraints": { "<key>": { "value", "chosen_by", "prompt", "design_consequence", "question_id?", "source?" } },
  "ai_constraints": { "...": "..." },
  "startup_constraints": { "...": "..." }
}
```

`ai_constraints` omitted when no AI artifacts. `startup_constraints` optional (Q27).

## Constraint catalog (prompt + consequence templates)

Use when assembling Step 5. Replace `[value]` with the interpreted constraint.

## Report consumption (`appendix-config`)

Generate phase reads **every** constraint object and renders:

| Column                | Source                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question / assumption | `prompt`                                                                |
| Your choice           | formatted `value`                                                       |
| Source                | `chosen_by` → User answer / Extracted / Default / Derived               |
| Source signal         | `source` (only for Extracted/Default rows; omit column cell for others) |
| Design consequence    | `design_consequence`                                                    |

Sort rows: user-answered first, then extracted, then default, then derived. Include `startup_constraints` when present. Rows where `source` starts with `"default:"` are unverified assumptions — render in a visually distinct style.

If legacy `preferences.json` lacks `prompt` / `design_consequence` (pre-schema-extension runs), fall back to the catalog table above keyed by constraint name — do not leave the appendix empty.

## Validation (Clarify Step 5 self-check)

Before marking Clarify complete:

1. Every written constraint has `value`, `chosen_by`, `prompt`, and `design_consequence`.
2. No empty strings for `prompt` or `design_consequence`.
3. `question_id` present when the constraint maps to a catalog question.
4. `source` present on every constraint where `chosen_by` is `"extracted"` or `"default"`. Omit for `"user"` and `"derived"`.
