# Report Decision Core (shared renderer spec)

The executive-summary sections below are the **decision core** — the single
source of truth for verdict, cost, timeline, risk, and assumption rendering.
Two consumers load this file; the content rules are identical in both:

| Mode         | Loaded by                                 | Output                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **decision** | `estimate.md` Decision gate, choice **A** | Standalone `decision-report.html` + `DECISION.md` — decision core only, no appendices, CTA footer |
| **full**     | `generate-artifacts-report.md` Step 1     | The executive-summary block of `migration-report.html`, followed by the appendices                |

**Never patch one output into the other.** When Execute runs after a Decide
run, `migration-report.html` is rendered **fresh from the artifacts** — do not
extend, edit, or splice `decision-report.html`. All data needed for either
output lives in the JSON artifacts.

## Decision-mode specifics

- **Artifacts available:** discovery + `preferences.json` + `aws-design*.json` + `estimation-*.json` (+ `migration-preview.json`, `scenarios/` when present). `generation-*.json` and `terraform/` do NOT exist. Sections that prefer Generate artifacts carry an inline **_Decision mode:_** override next to the full-mode rule (decision-summary item 4, Sections 2b, 3 footnote, 4, 6, 7) — **those inline overrides are the authoritative decision-mode law**; when a section has no override, its rule applies unchanged in both modes.
- **HTML shell:** same `<head>` (charset, viewport, inline CSS) and CSS specification as the full report (see `generate-artifacts-report.md` Step 3), title "GCP to AWS Migration Assessment — Decision Report". Body contains ONLY the `executive-summary` div with the exec sections and TOC (TOC links only to sections present; `nav.toc` carries `id="toc"` and every section `<h2>` ends with the `↑ contents` toplink per the nav-aids CSS spec). Opening order follows the hero-is-the-thesis rule: `decision-summary` first, TOC after it. Required section IDs in decision mode: `decision-summary`, `exec-assumptions`, `exec-services`, `exec-costs`, `exec-timeline`, `exec-risks` (+ conditional `exec-tco`, `exec-architecture`, `exec-security-teaser`, `what-if-scenarios` per their triggers).
- **CTA footer (required, after the last section):** `<section id="decision-cta">` — "**Ready to execute?** Say \"generate the Terraform and migration scripts\" and I'll produce the full execution pack (Terraform, migration scripts, rollback runbook, fill-in checklist) from this same analysis." Plus one line: "This decision report was generated without execution artifacts; the full migration report replaces it if you proceed."
- **`DECISION.md` (required twin):** same content as the HTML, as plain Markdown (Slack/GitHub-friendly): verdict headline, cost table, migrate-if/stay-if lists, timeline band, top risks, assumptions, CTA line. No HTML tags.
- **Validation:** run `scripts/validate-migration-report.py $MIGRATION_DIR/decision-report.html --mode decision [--estimation-infra ...] [--estimation-ai ...]` and fix failures before presenting.
- All content rules below apply unchanged: baseline-quality badge + not-comparable rule, cost labeling ("Est."), readability (no artifact filenames in exec sections, no "Section N" headings, ordered action lists), Activate wording rules.

The executive summary is the first thing visible when opening the report. Design it to fit approximately 1–2 printed pages.

### Executive Summary Content

**Header:** "GCP to AWS Migration Assessment" with subtitle "Executive Summary" and generation date.

**Table of contents (required — placed AFTER the decision summary, never before it):** Linked `<nav class="toc">` listing all executive sections and appendix sections present in this report. **Every `href="#section-id"` MUST match a `<section id="section-id">` on the page exactly** (same string, including hyphens). Omit TOC links only for sections not rendered.

**The hero is the thesis (opening order):** the reader's first screenful is the decision, not navigation. Page order: title line → `decision-summary` (verdict headline + hero metrics) → TOC → remaining sections. An 18-link menu between the title and the verdict makes the reader scroll past chrome to learn the answer; the document's thesis — "Go, with conditions · $X/mo · phased, long pole: database cutover" — must be visible before any menu.

**Target length:** approximately 2–4 printed pages for executive summary. _Full mode only:_ **Do NOT truncate appendices** to fit page count — appendices may be long.

**Anti-stub rule (mandatory; the appendix clauses apply in full mode only):** every rendered section MUST carry real artifact data as HTML tables and prose. **Forbidden:** sections that only say "see `estimation-infra.json`" or list JSON filenames without numeric costs, service mappings, or migration phases. Reference fixture: `migrate/plugins/migration-to-aws/fixtures/migration-report-reference.html`.

**Section 0 — Migration Decision Summary (REQUIRED):**

Pull from `estimation-infra.json` → `recommendation` block. Fallback chain if `recommendation` is absent:

1. `estimation-infra.json` → `financial_summary.recommendation` (string) — use as `path_label`; synthesize `migrate_if` / `stay_if` from Part 7 prose defaults in `estimate-infra.md`
2. `migration-preview.json` — show complexity + timeline only; label: "Full recommendation requires Estimate phase — run Phase 4"

Content when `recommendation` block exists:

1. **Verdict (typography-first — the verdict is the thesis of this section):** When `recommendation.outcome` exists (v2 artifacts), render `outcome_label` as the section's **headline statement** in large display type (e.g. `<p class="verdict-headline">Go, with conditions</p>`), followed by one labeled metadata line in body type: "Execution shape: [path_label] · Complexity: [complexity_signal]". The hierarchy encodes the real relationship — the decision is the headline; how and how-hard are attributes of it. Do **not** render the verdict as a row of colored pill badges: structure should carry the information, and meaning must never depend on color alone (a muted color accent on the headline is fine; the words carry the verdict). When `outcome` is absent (pre-extension artifacts), the same treatment applies with `path_label` as the headline. When `conditional_go`: render `conditions[]` as a short checklist directly under the metadata line. When `defer_for_evidence`: lead with what IS established ("AWS can host this stack; AWS-side estimate $X–$Y/mo" + the designed-slice mapping), then the named missing evidence and how to obtain it — do not show a savings headline as if the decision were made, and do not present defer as "no answer."
   1a. **Recommendation callout (required):** Render the one-sentence
   recommendation narrative directly below the headline/meta as
   `<div class="verdict">…</div>`. For `go`, `conditional_go`, and
   migrate-path legacy outcomes, use the green positive callout treatment
   defined by the shared CSS. For `stay` or `defer_for_evidence`, use the
   warning/neutral variant instead — never use green to imply approval. The
   explicit recommendation words remain required; color is only a scanning
   aid.
   1a. **Per-track disposition line (required when `recommendation.track_outcomes` exists):** one line under the verdict metadata, plain names, one clause per track — e.g. "By track: Compute + database: **go**. AI text: **go**. AI image: **conditional** — keeps the current provider via the adapter until the quality eval passes; does not gate the rest. Analytics: **deferred** — specialist track, parallel." Render the track note verbatim. **Never render a track-scoped condition as a whole-stack stay reason**: the Stay-if list holds only entries the artifact scoped to the whole stack; track-prefixed conditions render in the conditions checklist and the track line. Omit silently for single-track or pre-extension artifacts.
   1b. **Confidence pointer:** one line under the verdict block — `Confidence: [confidence] — full basis in <a href="#exec-assumptions">What This Assessment Rests On</a>.` The full assumptions panel lives at the **end** of the executive summary (see Section 8 below), not here.
2. **Complexity:** from `migration-preview.json` → `complexity_signal` ("Simple", "Moderate", "Complex") — colored badge
3. **Cost headline:** from `estimation-infra.json` → `cost_comparison.option_b_balanced` vs GCP baseline, OR legacy `comparison.aws_balanced_monthly_usd` vs `comparison.gcp_monthly_usd`. Do NOT use `migration-preview.json` → `cost_preview` when estimation artifact exists (preview is superseded). If only preview exists: show labeled "Early estimate (±30%) — full analysis not yet run."
4. **Timeline:** week counts are never rendered in either mode — the plugin has no calibrated duration data (`shared/migration-complexity.md` § Provenance). _Full mode:_ approach + the binding duration driver from `generation-infra.json` → `migration_plan.duration_drivers[]` (e.g. "Phased, in dependency order — long pole: database cutover"). _Decision mode:_ `migration-preview.json` → `duration_hint` (path-shape phrasing) when present, else the tier's driver summary from `shared/migration-complexity.md`; label it "**if you execute**". **Legacy artifacts:** when an old artifact carries `total_weeks` or `timeline_hint` week ranges, render only with the visible label "Legacy planning heuristic (uncalibrated): N weeks" — never bare. In neither mode use `recommendation.next_steps` as timeline — those are action items, not duration.
5. **Migrate if / Stay if:** from `recommendation.migrate_if` and `recommendation.stay_if`. Render as two compact lists. For BigQuery/deferred analytics: **do not** frame specialist engagement as a reason to stay on GCP unless the user must cut over analytics in the **same window** as app infra. Prefer migrate-if bullets that mention parallel specialist planning.
6. **Key decisions ahead:** from `migration-preview.json` → `key_decisions_ahead` — **ordered list** (`<ol class="compact">`), not bullets. Each item is one concrete decision the reader must make next.
   6b. **What would flip this (v2 artifacts):** from `recommendation.would_flip_if[]` when present — short unordered list immediately after Migrate if / Stay if. Skip silently when absent.
7. **Next steps (optional):** from `recommendation.next_steps` — **ordered list** (`<ol class="compact">`) of actionable steps separate from timeline. Numbered sequence implies priority order; keep `Migrate if` / `Stay if` as unordered lists.

**Deferred services flag:** If ANY resource in the design artifact has `aws_service == "Deferred — specialist engagement"`, add a prominent callout:

> ⚠️ **Specialist engagement required:** [service name] does not have an automated AWS mapping from this plugin. Engage your AWS account team and/or a data analytics migration partner to evaluate the best AWS analytics path. This does **not** block phased migration of other services; exclude [service name] from the combined estimated AWS monthly run rate until the target architecture is defined.

**Startup credits callout (decision summary / verdict):**

| `startup_program_status.value` | Verdict / metric copy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eligible_founders`            | May state "Eligible for up to $5K AWS Activate Founders credits" and link `STARTUP_PROGRAMS.md`                                                                                                                                                      |
| `eligible_portfolio`           | May state Portfolio credits (up to $200K) and Org ID requirement                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `has_credits`                  | Note existing credits; no "apply for" language                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `unknown`                      | **Neutral only:** e.g. "Review AWS Activate tiers in `STARTUP_PROGRAMS.md` — funding stage not confirmed in Clarify." **Do not** write "Eligible Founders tier", "your status: eligible_*", or dollar amounts tied to a specific tier in the verdict |

**Sidebar callout box:** Show the 💡 Activate callout when `startup_program_status.value` is **not** `unknown`, **or** when `unknown` but you use the neutral wording above (optional). When `unknown`, do **not** imply a confirmed tier. **The Activate item is ALWAYS this callout, never a metric card** — it is a call-to-action with a link, not a measurement, and rendering it in the metric grid gives it false equivalence with the run-rate and timeline figures. The clickable apply link goes inside the callout.

**Metric hierarchy (when the decision summary renders a metric grid):** the reader should not have to rank the numbers themselves. The one or two **primary** decision metrics — the combined (or single-track) AWS run rate, and the migration shape (approach + binding driver, e.g. "Phased · long pole: database cutover") — render first with `.metric-hero` treatment (larger value, accent border). Supporting metrics (per-track costs, savings percentages) follow as standard cards, max ~5 total. Never render a week count or effort-hours as a metric card.

Do **not** infer Activate tier from `gcp_monthly_spend` or `ai_monthly_spend` in the report or `estimation-*.json` ROI bullets.

**Apply link (required):** Whenever the report or `STARTUP_PROGRAMS.md` mentions AWS Activate credits, include at least one clickable link to the official apply page: `<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits/">AWS Activate credits</a>` (HTML report) or `[AWS Activate credits](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/credits/)` (Markdown). Place it in the decision-summary verdict, a callout, and/or the Next steps ordered list — not only in the appendix artifact catalog. When an Activate metric card is rendered, put the clickable apply link **inside that card** so the action remains attached to the benefit.

_Full mode only:_ after Generate, run `scripts/validate-startup-program-artifacts.py --migration-dir $MIGRATION_DIR`. (Decision mode: the Activate wording rules above still apply to the rendered content; the script runs when the Generate artifacts it checks exist.)

**Section 1b — Estimated AWS Monthly Run Rate (`exec-tco`, REQUIRED when both `estimation-infra.json` AND `estimation-ai.json` exist):**

`exec-tco` is a legacy structural ID retained for validator compatibility; the
customer-facing heading MUST NOT say "TCO" or "Total Cost of Ownership." This
assessment models recurring cloud-service charges, not staffing, operations,
support, migration labor, or other ownership costs.

Show the combined estimated AWS monthly cloud-service run rate **excluding**
deferred services (e.g. BigQuery):

| Row            | GCP                                                      | AWS Balanced                                | Notes                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Infrastructure | `current_costs.gcp_monthly`                              | `projected_costs.aws_monthly_balanced`      | From infra estimate                                                |
| AI / ML        | `current_costs.gcp_monthly_ai_spend` or AI band midpoint | `cost_comparison.projected_bedrock_monthly` | From AI estimate                                                   |
| **Combined**   | sum only when all source baselines are comparable        | sum                                         | No overall Δ/% if any source baseline is partial or not comparable |

If `estimation-ai.json` → `optimized_projection` exists, footnote the optimized AI path separately.
Add one sentence: "This is an estimated cloud-service run rate, not total cost
of ownership." When the infrastructure baseline is inventory-derived or
standing-charges-only, show "Not comparable" in the combined GCP cell and
never sum it with a user-stated AI midpoint.

Source: `estimation-infra.json`, `estimation-ai.json`

**Section 1 — Current Stack Overview:**

- Count of PRIMARY GCP services detected (from design artifact — filter to primary classification only; exclude secondary/supporting resources like default VPC firewalls)
- List each PRIMARY GCP service with its type (e.g., "Cloud Run (compute)", "Cloud SQL (database)")
- Source: design artifact (filtered)

**Section 2 — Recommended AWS Architecture:**

- Table with columns: GCP Service, AWS Service, **How we chose this**
- **How we chose this** values: use `design-refs/fast-path.md` → **User-facing vocabulary** — **Standard pairing** (`deterministic`), **Tailored to your setup** (`inferred`), **Estimated from billing only** (`billing_inferred`). Show the **bold phrase** in the table; JSON value optional in a tooltip or footnote for technical readers only.
- One row per mapped service
- If any service has `human_expertise_required: true`, mark it with a warning indicator and footnote: "Specialist guidance recommended — contact your AWS account team"
- Source: design artifact

**Section 2b — Architecture diagram (`exec-architecture`, REQUIRED when `aws-design.json` clusters exist):**

ASCII or structured diagram showing: users → ALB → compute → database/storage/AI; security baseline box; deferred services called out.

_Full mode:_ include **migration cluster order** from `generation-infra.json` → `migration_plan.cluster_order`. Source: `aws-design.json`, `generation-infra.json`.

_Decision mode:_ render the diagram from `aws-design.json` clusters only — **omit cluster order** (`generation-infra.json` does not exist yet). Source: `aws-design.json`.

**Section 3 — Cost Comparison:**

- Side-by-side display: Current GCP Monthly vs Estimated AWS Monthly (**Balanced** tier — the default scenario for comparing to GCP)
- **Baseline-quality badge (required):** label the GCP figure using `current_costs.source` and the display-label table in `estimate-infra.md` Part 1 — "Measured from your GCP billing (±5%)" / "Estimated from resource configs (±20–30%, standing charges only)" / "Your stated spend band from Clarify" / "Your stated figure (unverified)". **Never** place an inventory-only GCP figure beside a user spend band without the explicit not-comparable line from `estimate-infra.md` Part 1 — they measure different things.
- Percent change (savings or increase)
- Render supported savings values with the green `.savings` class and supported
  increases with `.increase`. Never color a percentage as savings when the GCP
  and AWS baselines are not comparable; use an absolute estimated-cost card
  plus the not-comparable note instead.
- **Cost labeling rule:** All dollar figures in cost tables and metrics MUST be labeled as estimated monthly costs. Use column headers like "Est. Monthly AWS" or "Estimated Monthly" — never present figures as exact amounts.
- **Not-comparable rendering:** the mandatory not-comparable warning is NOT collapsible and does not sit as a paragraph between the heading and the numbers — attach it to the GCP figure itself: a `.chip-warn` pill ("⚠ not comparable") on the metric card plus the one-line explanation in its `<small>` (what the figure measures, what the stated band measures, "do not read a savings %").
- **How to read cost tiers (required when infra estimation with three tiers exists; rendered as a `<details class="reading-guide">` immediately AFTER the tier table — data first, explanation adjacent):** The three AWS monthly figures are **estimated monthly costs** for the **same** mapped architecture (same services in `aws-design.json`), not three different generated Terraform stacks. **Order = highest → middle → lowest** monthly estimate in this model. Use **Balanced** as the **primary** row vs GCP; **Premium** and **Optimized** are **bounds** (higher HA / newer skew vs cost-optimization skew). When `terraform/` is present, it implements **one** infrastructure baseline aligned with the **Balanced** cost scenario (see `terraform/README.md` and `migration_summary` output).
- If 3 tiers available: show **Premium**, **Balanced**, and **Optimized** with **short subtitles** (second line or subtext under each label), plus a **"vs Balanced, for this stack" column** from `projected_costs.scenario_deltas` when present — the itemized differences are the decision content (a reader must be able to answer "what would I buy at Premium / give up at Optimized?" from the table alone). Architectural deltas carry their consequence verbatim from the artifact (e.g. "Drops NAT Gateway — tasks move to public subnets or VPC endpoints; posture change, not just savings"); commitment-based savings name the commitment. Balanced's cell is "— anchor; matches generated Terraform" (full mode) or "— anchor" (decision mode). When `scenario_deltas` is absent (pre-extension artifacts), omit the column — do not invent deltas. Do NOT expand the generic tier definitions to compensate; the reading-guide `<details>` already covers same-architecture semantics:
  - **Premium** — _Highest resilience / highest monthly estimate in this model_
  - **Balanced** — _Default scenario; compare GCP to this row first_
  - **Optimized** — _Lower monthly estimate; reservations, Spot, or storage trade-offs assumed_
- **Footnote (required):** _All figures are estimated monthly costs based on AWS pricing data at time of analysis._ Then, _full mode:_ _Only one Terraform configuration is generated (Balanced-aligned baseline). Premium and Optimized are what-if cost models in `estimation-infra.json` — adjust IaC yourself if you want those postures in production._ _Decision mode:_ _If you generate the execution pack, its Terraform will align with the Balanced scenario; Premium and Optimized are what-if cost models._
- **Only include "GCP data transfer egress (est.)" when the infra estimation artifact has `migration_cost_considerations.billing_data_available === true`.** Never present human one-time migration costs. If `false` or only non-infra estimates exist, footnote: "GCP data transfer egress estimates require billing data and the infra estimate path."
- If observability entry exists in `projected_costs.breakdown` (tolerant lookup: array where `service` contains "Observability" OR object where key contains `observability` or `cloudwatch`) AND the entry's `note` field mentions GCP free tiers:

> **Observability cost note:** [Pull the `note` field verbatim]

- Source: estimation artifact

**Section 3b — What-if scenarios (`what-if-scenarios`, OPTIONAL):**

Render **only when** `$MIGRATION_DIR/scenarios/index.json` exists and
`scenarios[]` has **≥ 2** entries (baseline + at least one workshop variant).
Omit entirely when workshop was declined or never entered.

1. Load `scenarios/index.json`. For each entry (baseline first, then by
   `created_at`), read the manifest at `entry.manifest`.
2. HTML table matching `workshop-compare.md` columns:

| Scenario | Region | HA | Compute | Arch | Premium $/mo | Balanced $/mo | Optimized $/mo | Complexity |
| -------- | ------ | -- | ------- | ---- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- | ---------- |

Resolve knobs from each scenario's preferences copy (or
`preferences_subset` / `estimation_summary` on the manifest): Region ←
`design_constraints.target_region.value`; HA ←
`design_constraints.availability.value`; Compute ←
`design_constraints.kubernetes.value` when present; Arch ←
`design_constraints.cpu_architecture.value`. Costs and complexity ←
`estimation_summary`.
3. Mark the active row (`scenario_id == index.active_scenario_id`) with
`class="active-scenario"` or an "(active)" label.
4. Under the table: active vs baseline knob deltas (plain language); any
`graviton_note` / `region_note`; for each scenario with a non-null
`estimation_summary.calculator_url`, an "open in AWS Pricing Calculator" link
(stakeholders can open and edit; AWS computes regional prices server-side);
remind that discovery inventory is frozen
and generated Terraform matches the **active** scenario only.
5. TOC: link `#what-if-scenarios` only when rendered. Place this section in the
executive flow immediately after `exec-costs` (before security teaser /
timeline).

**Section 4 — Security & Cost Guardrails (teaser — full table in Appendix G):**

Show top controls as a compact teaser:

| Control                        | What it does for you                                               | Monthly cost                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| GuardDuty                      | Detects compromised credentials and crypto mining within minutes   | ~$2–25/mo                            |
| CloudTrail                     | Immutable audit log of every API call — required for SOC 2         | ~$0.50–3/mo                          |
| Budget alerts                  | Email when spend exceeds threshold — catches runaway resources     | $0                                   |
| Bedrock cost anomaly detection | Alerts within ~24h if AI spend spikes unexpectedly (AI track only) | $0 (Cost Explorer anomaly detection) |

The fourth row is **conditional** — only render when `$MIGRATION_DIR/ai-migration/bedrock_monitoring.tf` exists on disk. Do NOT render based on `generation-ai.json` alone.

_Full mode:_ > See Appendix G for full security and cost guardrails table with GCP equivalents.

_Decision mode:_ > The full control-by-control table is included if you generate the execution pack.

If `preferences.json` contains compliance values (`soc2`, `pci`, `hipaa`, `fedramp`):

> **Compliance note:** Your declared compliance requirement ([standard]) triggers additional controls (AWS Config + Security Hub) at ~$3–25/mo. _(Full mode: append "See Appendix G.")_

**Do NOT include step-by-step enablement** — that belongs in `terraform/README.md` and `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.

Source: static content + `preferences.json` compliance values

**Section 5 — Operational Changes (conditional rows only):**

Only render rows for service types PRESENT in the design artifact. Do not show rows for services not in the migration.

| GCP Service        | AWS Service | What stays the same                                 | What's new                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

**Conditional rendering:** Check design artifact for each `gcp_type` / `aws_service` pair. Only include rows where the GCP source type exists in the design. If a service category has no match, skip that row entirely.

**Section 6 — Timeline:**

- _Full mode:_ migration approach (phased/fast-track/conservative), the ordered
  stage sequence (no week column — order is the information), `duration_drivers[]`
  with the binding driver first, and the operational time policies (watch
  periods, observation windows — these are policy, keep them). **No
  implementation-effort hours** — uncalibrated staffing-shaped numbers get
  pasted into budgets; if a legacy artifact carries hour fields, drop them
  (do not render even with a label). When infrastructure was classified Large
  solely because AI coexists, treat that as an invalid stale classification
  and re-run complexity sizing before rendering. Source: generation plan.
- _Decision mode:_ the same rules as decision-summary item 4 (`duration_hint` path-shape, else tier driver summary, labeled "if you execute"; legacy week values only with the "Legacy planning heuristic (uncalibrated)" label), plus the migration approach from `recommendation.path_label`. **Omit engineering effort hours** — they don't exist before Generate and are never estimated. Source: `migration-preview.json` / complexity drivers / estimation artifact.

**Section 7 — Top Risks:**

- Up to 3 highest-severity risks
- Table columns: Risk · **Impact** · **Likelihood** · Mitigation — impact and likelihood are separate badge columns (`.badge-impact-critical` / `.badge-impact-high`, `.badge-like-low` / `.badge-like-medium`), never combined into one prose string like "Critical impact (low probability)" — a risk matrix is scanned, not read
- _Full mode source:_ generation plan `risk_assessment` (preferred).
- _Decision mode source_ (in order; **never leave `exec-risks` empty** when any of these exist): (1) risk/condition items in `estimation-infra.json` → `recommendation` (`conditions[]`, `would_flip_if[]`); (2) deferred-specialist rows from the design artifact (e.g. BigQuery excluded from totals); (3) material `chosen_by: "default"` assumptions with cost or HA impact from `preferences.json` (e.g. availability defaulted — "~2x database cost swing; confirm before cutover sizing"). Invent nothing beyond these artifacts.

**Section 8 — What this assessment rests on (`exec-assumptions`, REQUIRED):**

> Rendered heading is a plain title — e.g. `<h2>What This Assessment Rests On</h2>` with `<section id="exec-assumptions">`. Never render a literal "Section 8" heading (validator readability rule).

Placed at the **end of the executive summary** — after Top Risks, immediately before the appendices — where assumption and validation sections conventionally sit in a migration report. The decision summary links here via the confidence pointer (item 1b). Three parts, all read from existing artifacts — invent nothing:

1. **Assumptions applied by default** — table of every constraint in `preferences.json` with `chosen_by: "default"`: Setting (plain name), Assumed value, and the constraint's `design_consequence` verbatim. When no constraint was defaulted, render one line: "All inputs were confirmed by you or extracted from your Terraform/billing — nothing was assumed."
2. **Confidence** — one line from `recommendation.confidence` with a plain-language gloss: high — "inputs measured or confirmed"; medium — "some material inputs assumed"; low — "key inputs missing or stale". When v2 `decision_basis` exists, render its three lists (measured / assumed / unknown) as compact columns instead of the single line.
3. **Pricing provenance** — from the estimation artifact: `pricing_source` + cache date + `accuracy_confidence` band, matching the wording the Estimate chat summary already uses (e.g. "Estimates based on cached AWS pricing (2026-03-07), accuracy ±5–10%").

TOC: link `#exec-assumptions` in the executive list. The anti-stub rule applies: this section must render actual settings and consequences, never "see preferences.json".

Source: `preferences.json`, `estimation-infra.json` (falls back to `estimation-ai.json` accuracy fields for AI-only runs)
