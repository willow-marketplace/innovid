name: llm-to-bedrock
description: "Use when the user wants to migrate code that calls OpenAI, Gemini/Google AI, or the Anthropic API to Amazon Bedrock — a pure model/SDK rewrite. End-to-end: assesses the codebase, then rewrites SDK calls, evaluates output quality against Bedrock, and delivers a ready-to-merge git branch. Not for: agent runtime selection, agentic architecture decisions, or agent migration planning — use agent-advisor for those. Not for standalone Bedrock cost estimates or infrastructure-only migration. The Assess phase is handled by this plugin's own gcp-to-aws skill."
---
# Migrate to Bedrock (Assess + Execute)

Single-command AI migration: OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic → Amazon Bedrock.

The skill base directory is given in the "Base directory for this skill: X" line the harness
emits at load time. Call it `<SKILL_BASE>`. Derived paths:

- `$SCRIPTS` = `<SKILL_BASE>/scripts`
- `$HELPERS` = `<SKILL_BASE>/references/helpers` (the former helper skills, now references)

---

## Step 0 — Check prerequisites

### 0a. Check that `uv` is available

```bash
uv --version 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING"
```

If missing: "Install uv first: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`". Stop.

---

## Step 1 — Collect source code path

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a path, use it as `$REPO`. Otherwise use **AskUserQuestion**:
"Where is your source code? Enter a local path or GitHub URL."

If a GitHub URL, `git clone` it to a temp dir; use that path as `$REPO`.

**Checks on $REPO:**

1. **Git-root check** (compare resolved paths — on macOS `/tmp` resolves to `/private/tmp`,
   so a raw string comparison false-positives):

   ```bash
   [ "$(git -C <REPO> rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" = "$(cd <REPO> && pwd -P)" ] && echo GIT_ROOT_OK || echo GIT_ROOT_MISMATCH
   ```

   - `GIT_ROOT_OK` → proceed.
   - `GIT_ROOT_MISMATCH` and the command errored (not a git repo at all) → tell the user the
     path must be a git repository (the deliverable is a git branch); re-ask.
   - `GIT_ROOT_MISMATCH` but inside a repo (user pointed at a subdirectory) → AskUserQuestion:
     "Use the repo root instead" (recommended) / "Continue with this subdirectory" / "Abort".

2. **Dirty-tree check:**

   ```bash
   git -C <REPO> status --porcelain
   ```

   If uncommitted changes exist, show them and AskUserQuestion: "Continue anyway" or "Let me clean up first".

Record `$REPO` for all subsequent steps.

---

## Phase A — Assess (MANDATORY: delegate to the gcp-to-aws skill)

**CRITICAL: You MUST use the Skill tool to invoke `migration-to-aws:gcp-to-aws` (a sibling skill
in this same plugin). Do NOT perform the Assess phase yourself. Do NOT read source code, detect
AI SDKs, or ask Clarify questions manually. The entire Assess phase is handled by the gcp-to-aws
skill — you only invoke it and wait for completion.**

### A1 — Invoke the Assess skill

Call the **Skill** tool with skill name `migration-to-aws:gcp-to-aws`.

Before invoking, tell the user:

> "I'm now invoking the migration-to-aws Assess skill to discover your AI workloads and design
> the Bedrock migration. It will ask you some questions — please answer them. (Don't be
> confused by the skill's `gcp-to-aws` name — it also covers pure AI/LLM migrations with no
> GCP or infrastructure component, which is how it's being used here.)"

After invoking the Skill tool, the `gcp-to-aws` skill instructions will load into context.
Follow those instructions exactly — they will drive the Discover, Clarify, Design, Estimate,
and Generate phases. The source code to scan is at `$REPO`.

**Important context for the gcp-to-aws skill execution:**

- Source code is at `$REPO` — when the skill asks for GCP sources or scans for files, point it there
- This is an AI/LLM workload migration — the AI path is the goal
- Unless Terraform/IaC files are actually present in `$REPO`, skip IaC discovery
- Unless the user offers billing data, skip billing discovery

### A2 — Wait for Assess completion

The `gcp-to-aws` skill is a state machine. After each phase completes, it may stop and wait
for the next invocation. Check progress against the LATEST run directory only (older
`.migration/` runs may contain a stale "completed" status):

```bash
MIGRATION_DIR=$(ls -td "$REPO/.migration"/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
# Stdlib-only JSON read — no boto3, so bare python3 is fine here (no pinned env needed).
python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(open('$MIGRATION_DIR/.phase-status.json'))['phases'].get('generate','missing'))" 2>/dev/null || echo "no-status-file"
```

- `completed` → proceed to A3.
- Anything else (including `no-status-file`) → the skill needs to run again. Re-invoke
  `migration-to-aws:gcp-to-aws` via the Skill tool — it picks up where it left off.

**Cap: at most 6 re-invocations.** If `generate` is still not `completed` after 6, stop and
show the user the last status output — the Assess skill is stuck and needs manual attention;
looping further just burns context.

### A3 — Locate Assess output

Find `$MIGRATION_DIR` (the `.migration/<MMDD-HHMM>/` directory that was created):

```bash
ls -td "$REPO/.migration"/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Verify these files exist in `$MIGRATION_DIR`:

- `aws-design-ai.json` (model mapping + architecture)
- `ai-workload-profile.json` (detected workloads)
- `preferences.json` (user preferences from Clarify)

If `aws-design-ai.json` is missing, Assess did not complete the AI path correctly. Show the
error and stop.

---

## Phase B — Execute Prep

### B1 — Read Assess outputs

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/aws-design-ai.json` and extract:

- `ai_architecture.bedrock_models[]` → array of `{source_model, aws_model_id, use_case}`
- Collect all `aws_model_id` values into `$TARGET_MODELS` (array). Keep the `use_case` of each:
  the preflight script probes each model by the right API automatically (Converse for chat,
  InvokeModel for embeddings), but the evaluator's quality scoring only applies to chat models —
  embedding targets get format/dimension validation only.

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/ai-workload-profile.json` and extract:

- `summary.ai_source` → source provider

Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json` and extract:

- `design_constraints.target_region` → `$REGION` (default `us-east-1` if absent)

**Validation:** If `aws-design-ai.json` has no `ai_architecture.bedrock_models[]` array, or the
array is empty, STOP: "Assess output incomplete — model mapping missing."

### B2 — AWS identity confirmation

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity 2>&1
```

**If the command fails** (no credentials, expired SSO token): show the error and tell the user
to run `aws configure` or `aws sso login` (suggest typing `! aws sso login` to run it in this
session), then re-run B2. Do not proceed without a confirmed identity.

On success, show Account, Arn, UserId via **AskUserQuestion**:
"This AWS identity will be used for Bedrock calls. Is this correct?"

Options:

- **Yes, use this identity** → proceed
- **Use a different AWS profile** → ask which profile, record it as `$AWS_PROFILE_CHOICE`,
  re-run B2 as `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile $AWS_PROFILE_CHOICE`, and re-confirm.
  **Do NOT rely on exporting `AWS_PROFILE`** — env vars do not persist across Bash tool calls
  or into workflow subagents (see B3). Instead pass the choice explicitly everywhere:
  `--profile` on every aws CLI call, and prepend `AWS_PROFILE=$AWS_PROFILE_CHOICE` inline on
  the B4 preflight command and inside the workflow args (`awsProfile` field) so subagents can
  do the same.

Also confirm region: "Bedrock region will be `$REGION`. OK or override?"

### B3 — Source API key (optional)

First, create the artifact directory and make it self-ignoring IMMEDIATELY — before any key
exists, so the secret is never sitting in an unignored working tree (even if the user aborts
before the rewriter runs):

```bash
mkdir -p "$REPO/.saws-migrate" && printf '*\n' > "$REPO/.saws-migrate/.gitignore"
```

Determine `$KEY_ENV_VAR` from B1's source provider (this is the env-var name the baseline
skill's parser expects — a bare key without the `NAME=` prefix will NOT be parsed):

- `openai` → `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `anthropic` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `google` / `gemini` → `GEMINI_API_KEY`

**AskUserQuestion:** "Do you have an API key for the source model (e.g. OpenAI key for GPT-4o)?
Providing it enables side-by-side quality comparison. Without it, evaluation uses absolute scoring only."

Options:

- **Yes — I'll paste my key** → warn first: "Note: the key will pass through this chat
  transcript. If you prefer, choose 'I'll write it to a file myself' instead." Then a second
  AskUserQuestion to collect it (free-text via Other). Then write it in `KEY=VALUE` form:

  ```bash
  printf "%s=%s\n" "$KEY_ENV_VAR" "<key>" > "$REPO/.saws-migrate/.source-provider-env" && chmod 600 "$REPO/.saws-migrate/.source-provider-env"
  ```

  Verify the format before proceeding (catches a stray paste without the prefix):

  ```bash
  grep -qE '^(OPENAI|ANTHROPIC|GEMINI)_API_KEY=.+' "$REPO/.saws-migrate/.source-provider-env" && echo KEY_FORMAT_OK || echo KEY_FORMAT_BAD
  ```

  On `KEY_FORMAT_BAD`, rewrite the file (do not echo its contents). Then set
  `sourceBaselineAvailable = true`, `sourceKeyRef = "$REPO/.saws-migrate/.source-provider-env"`.
- **I'll write it to a file myself** → tell the user to create
  `$REPO/.saws-migrate/.source-provider-env` containing a single `$KEY_ENV_VAR=...` line,
  then run the same `grep -qE` format check above (it never prints the key).
  Set the same flags as above.
- **Skip** → `sourceBaselineAvailable = false`, `sourceKeyRef = ""`.

(`.saws-migrate/` is already self-ignoring from the first command above; the rewriter
re-asserts this before any commit as a second layer.)

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use `export` or environment variables for the key. They do not persist
across Bash tool calls or into workflow subagents. Write to the file path above.

### B4 — Bedrock preflight

```bash
uv run --project $SCRIPTS python $SCRIPTS/preflight_bedrock.py --region $REGION --models <comma-separated $TARGET_MODELS> --dataset-size 200
```

(`--dataset-size 200` matches the golden-dataset cap, so the quota warning reflects the worst case. Prefix with `AWS_PROFILE=$AWS_PROFILE_CHOICE` if B2 chose a non-default profile.)

Parse the JSON output. On failure the TOP LEVEL carries `reason`/`detail` (lifted from the
first failing model) plus `failing_models` (all failing ids); per-model verdicts are in `models[]`:

- `ok == false` + `reason: credentials` → show the detail (configure/refresh credentials), stop; user re-runs after fixing.
- `ok == false` + `reason: model_access` → model access not enabled in the Bedrock console (NOT an IAM problem): point the user at the console Model access page for the failing models, stop; re-run B4 after they enable it.
- `ok == false` + `reason: authz` → IAM denies `bedrock:InvokeModel`: tell user the IAM action to grant; stop.
- `ok == false` + `reason: model_unavailable` → Read the `resolve-bedrock-model-id` reference at `$HELPERS/resolve-bedrock-model-id/resolve-bedrock-model-id.md` and follow its procedure with each ID from `failing_models` + region. AskUserQuestion with the candidates: "Use `<candidate>` (cross-region inference profile)" / "Paste a different model ID" / "Abort". On a choice, replace the ID in `$TARGET_MODELS` and re-run B4.
- `ok == false` + any other `reason` → show `detail` and stop.
- `ok == true` → proceed. Surface any `quota_warning`, and any model whose `reason` is
  `embedding_unprobed` (embedding family the preflight can't probe — remind the user to confirm
  model access in the console).

---

## Phase C — Execute

Phase C dispatches the five plugin agents sequentially via the **Agent tool** (subagent types
`migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-code-analyzer`, `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-log-ingestor`, `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-prompt-evaluator`,
`migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-code-rewriter`, `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-report-generator`). Each agent writes its result to
a file under `$PHASE_DIR = $REPO/.saws-migrate/phase-results/`; you validate every file with
the bundled validator before moving on. There is no workflow runtime — the files ARE the state.

### The validator (used at every step)

```bash
uv run --project $SCRIPTS python $SCRIPTS/validate_result.py --schema <analysis|ingestion|eval|rewrite|delta-decisions> <file>
```

- Exit 0 + `RESULT=valid CONTROL=ok` → phase completed; proceed.
- Exit 0 + `CONTROL=blocked REASON=<r>` → blocked flow (below).
- Exit 0 + `CONTROL=partial COMPLETED=<n> TOTAL=<m>` → partial flow (eval only).
- Exit 1 (`RESULT=invalid` + error lines) or exit 2 (file missing) → **stateless fixer retry**:
  dispatch a FRESH agent of the same type whose prompt is the original context block + the
  file path + the validator's verbatim error output + the instruction "fix ONLY the output
  file at `<path>` so it validates; do not redo the phase's work unless a required field is
  genuinely missing from it". Cap 2 retries per phase; then stop and show the errors.

### The context block (instantiated at every dispatch)

Build this exact line format (agents parse the labels). Omit lines marked optional when empty:

```
Repository: <$REPO>
AWS region: <$REGION>
AWS profile (pass as --profile / AWS_PROFILE= inline on every aws/boto3 invocation): <$AWS_PROFILE_CHOICE — omit line if default>
Target Bedrock model(s): <comma-joined $TARGET_MODELS, with any resolved overrides already applied>
Migration plan dir: <$MIGRATION_DIR>
Resolved target model id: <override for the primary chat model — omit if none>
Scripts directory (pinned uv toolchain): <$SCRIPTS>
Report date suffix: <saved suffix from run-context — C5/C6 dispatches only>
Source baseline available: <true|false>
Source provider env file: <path — omit if none>
User-supplied log files: <comma-joined — omit if none>
Golden dataset cap (max cases the ingestor may emit): 200
Phase results directory: <$PHASE_DIR>
Prior phase results (Read these files): <paths of already-validated phase JSONs>
Confirmed behavior-delta decisions file (Read it): <$PHASE_DIR/delta-decisions.json — C5 only>
<helper-reference lines — inject ONLY the ones this agent needs, per the table below>
```

Prior-phase results are passed as FILE PATHS — never inline their JSON into the prompt.

**Helper references (the former helper skills, now under `$HELPERS`).** Agents no longer
load skills by name; instead the agent Reads a helper reference at an absolute path you
inject. For each dispatch, add ONLY the helper lines that agent uses (per its `# 4` section):

| Agent (dispatch)                                             | Helper-reference lines to add                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C1 llm2bedrock-code-analyzer                                 | `behavior-delta-detection reference: $HELPERS/behavior-delta-detection/behavior-delta-detection.md`<br>`resolve-bedrock-model-id reference: $HELPERS/resolve-bedrock-model-id/resolve-bedrock-model-id.md`                                                                                                           |
| C5 llm2bedrock-code-rewriter                                 | `bedrock-known-fixes reference: $HELPERS/bedrock-known-fixes/bedrock-known-fixes.md`<br>`behavior-delta-detection reference: $HELPERS/behavior-delta-detection/behavior-delta-detection.md`<br>`dependency-conflict-resolution reference: $HELPERS/dependency-conflict-resolution/dependency-conflict-resolution.md` |
| C3 llm2bedrock-prompt-evaluator                              | `bedrock-known-fixes reference: $HELPERS/bedrock-known-fixes/bedrock-known-fixes.md`<br>`resolve-bedrock-model-id reference: $HELPERS/resolve-bedrock-model-id/resolve-bedrock-model-id.md`<br>`run-source-model-baseline reference: $HELPERS/run-source-model-baseline/run-source-model-baseline.md`                |
| C2 llm2bedrock-log-ingestor, C6 llm2bedrock-report-generator | (none — these agents load no helpers)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Expand `$HELPERS` to its absolute path (you have `<SKILL_BASE>`) so the subagent — where
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is empty — receives a resolvable absolute path.

### C0 — Run-context gate (resume safety)

The Eval phase makes one paid Bedrock call per golden case (and, with a source key, one paid
source-provider call per case). Before any dispatch, tell the user evaluation will invoke
Bedrock at their expense, capped at 200 cases.

1. `mkdir -p $PHASE_DIR`. Build `$PHASE_DIR/current-context.json` with exactly these fields
   (hashes via `shasum -a 256`; key hash is a fingerprint — never store the key value):

```json
{
  "repo_root": "<cd $REPO && pwd -P>",
  "migration_dir": "<$MIGRATION_DIR>",
  "region": "<$REGION>",
  "aws_profile": "<$AWS_PROFILE_CHOICE or \"\">",
  "aws_account": "<Account from B2>",
  "repo_head_sha": "<git -C $REPO rev-parse HEAD>",
  "repo_branch": "<git -C $REPO rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD>",
  "repo_dirty_sha256": "<sha256 of: git status --porcelain + git diff + git diff --cached, EACH with pathspecs -- . ':(exclude).saws-migrate' ':(exclude).migration' ':(exclude)MIGRATION_REPORT_*.md'; \"\" when all three are empty>",
  "target_models": [{"source_model": "...", "aws_model_id": "...", "use_case": "..."}],
  "resolved_model_overrides": {},
  "source_provider": "<from B1>",
  "source_baseline_available": <true|false from B3>,
  "source_key_sha256": "<sha256 of .source-provider-env contents, \"\" when absent>",
  "log_files": [{"path": "...", "sha256": "..."}],
  "max_golden_cases": 200,
  "assess_design_sha256": "<sha256 of $MIGRATION_DIR/aws-design-ai.json>",
  "report_date_suffix": "<date +%Y-%m-%d>",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "plugin_version": "<version from <plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json>"
}
```

1. **Stage 0 (post-C5 normalization).** If `$PHASE_DIR/rewrite.json` exists and validates as
   a payload (`CONTROL=ok`), do NOT use live `repo_*` values. Run three integrity checks:
   (1) `rewrite.baseline_parent_sha` equals the SAVED `repo_head_sha`; (2) `git rev-parse
   <rewrite.branch_name>` equals `rewrite.branch_tip_sha`; (3) `git status --porcelain` (with
   the artifact exclusions) is empty. All pass → copy the saved `repo_*` values into
   current-context verbatim, continue to step 3. Check 2 fails (tip moved) → STOP and
   AskUserQuestion: "Keep your commits (regenerate report only, with a mixed-authorship note)"
   / "Reset the branch to the rewriter's tip and regenerate from C6" / "Abort". Check 3 fails
   (dirty tree) → STOP and ask: commit/stash (then re-check) or discard the edits. Check 1
   fails → treat as a full `repo_*` mismatch in step 3.

2. If `$PHASE_DIR/run-context.json` exists, compare:

```bash
uv run --project $SCRIPTS python $SCRIPTS/validate_result.py --check-run-context $PHASE_DIR/run-context.json --current $PHASE_DIR/current-context.json
```

- `RUN_CONTEXT=match` → resume: walk C1→C2→C3→(C4: delta-decisions.json)→C5→(C6: report
  file) in order; a phase counts completed iff its file validates with `CONTROL=ok` (C6:
  iff `MIGRATION_REPORT_<saved suffix>.md` exists while rewrite.json is payload-valid).
  STOP the walk at the first missing/invalid/control-state file — blocked/partial files
  route to their flows below, NEVER count as completed. Offer the user "skip completed
  phases X..Y, resume at Z". Files after an unexplained gap: archive them with the gap.
- `RUN_CONTEXT=mismatch` → scoped invalidation. Map each MISMATCH line through this table,
  archive the named units to `$REPO/.saws-migrate/phase-results-archive/<saved suffix>-$(date +%H%M%S)/`
  (a SIBLING of phase-results/ — never nest it inside), **then immediately overwrite
  run-context.json with current-context.json** (carrying forward the saved
  `report_date_suffix` unless REPORT itself is being invalidated), then re-run the
  invalidated phases in order. Tell the user which fields differed and what re-runs.

| Mismatched field(s)                                                                                                               | Archive (units)                 | Keep      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |

Units: ANALYSIS = analysis.json · INGESTION = ingestion.json + `.saws-migrate/golden-dataset/`
· EVAL = eval.json + `.saws-migrate/eval-results/` (minus cost_compare.py) · REWRITE =
rewrite.json + delta-decisions.json · REPORT = `MIGRATION_REPORT_<saved suffix>.md`.

**Post-C5 reruns of C1–C3 need the pre-migration tree.** If rewrite.json was payload-valid
and the table invalidates ANALYSIS/INGESTION/EVAL: confirm with the user that the old
migration branch will be discarded (keep-or-reset flow first if the tip moved), then
`git checkout <saved repo_branch>`, delete the old branch and the `saws-migrate-baseline`
tag, and re-run from C1. If the user declines, stop — re-analyzing a tree that contains
the rewrite produces garbage.

1. No saved run-context → fresh run: write current-context.json as run-context.json, dispatch C1.

### C1 — Analyzer · C2 — Ingestor · C3 — Evaluator

For each phase in order, dispatch the agent with the context block (listing all
prior-phase file paths), then validate its output file:

| Step | agentType                                       | Output file                 | Schema    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| C1   | `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-code-analyzer`    | `$PHASE_DIR/analysis.json`  | analysis  |
| C2   | `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-log-ingestor`     | `$PHASE_DIR/ingestion.json` | ingestion |
| C3   | `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-prompt-evaluator` | `$PHASE_DIR/eval.json`      | eval      |

**Blocked flow** (`CONTROL=blocked`): resolve with the user per REASON —

- `model_access` → user enables the model in the Bedrock console (nothing fingerprinted
  changes; re-dispatch the blocked phase only)
- `model_unresolvable` → user picks/pastes an ID → record it in
  `resolved_model_overrides`, fold it into the Target line
- `source_key_auth` → user supplies a new key (re-run B3) or sets baseline unavailable
- `assess_output_missing` → re-run Phase A, then restart Phase C at C0

After ANY resolution, re-run the C0 recipe (rebuild current-context, apply the invalidation
table, overwrite run-context) and re-dispatch **from the earliest invalidated phase** — the
table, not the block location, decides where execution resumes.

**Partial flow** (eval only, `CONTROL=partial`): AskUserQuestion —

- **Continue remaining cases** → re-dispatch the evaluator with the extra context line:
  `Resume: raw_results.jsonl already contains completed cases — evaluate only prompts whose
  ids are not present in it, then re-score and overwrite eval.json`
- **Proceed with partial pass rate** → re-dispatch the evaluator with: `Finalize partial: do
  NOT call Bedrock again — score the cases already in raw_results.jsonl and emit the FULL
  eval payload over only those cases, with total_cases = the number scored and a notes prefix
  line 'partial_coverage: <completed>/<total> cases (throttled)'`. Then C4 runs normally.
- **Abort** → stop; the files stay on disk for a later C0 resume.

### C4 — Checkpoint (two gates) + persist decisions

**Gate (a) — Quality go/no-go.** Read `$PHASE_DIR/eval.json`. The threshold is
**pass rate >= 0.9 AND `source_baseline_quality != 'poor'`** (with `no_golden_cases: true`
in the notes there is no quality signal — always ask). At or above → proceed silently.
Below, AskUserQuestion:

- **Proceed anyway** → gate (b)
- **Change target model** → record in `resolved_model_overrides`, re-run C0 (the table
  invalidates ANALYSIS/EVAL and execution resumes at C1). Cap: 2 retries.
- **Abort** → stop, no code touched.

**Gate (a.5) — Rewrite strategy (from migration plan).** Read `migration_path` from
`$MIGRATION_DIR/aws-design-ai.json` → `ai_architecture.code_migration.migration_path`.
If the value is `"mantle"`, set `rewrite_strategy = "mantle"`. Otherwise (value is
`"converse"`, `"gpt-oss"`, or the field is absent), set `rewrite_strategy = "converse"`.
No user question needed — the decision was already made during the Assess/Design phase.

**Gate (b) — Behavior-delta resolution.** For each `analysis.behavior_deltas[]` with
`user_visible == true`, AskUserQuestion with the options from the `behavior-delta-detection`
reference (Read `$HELPERS/behavior-delta-detection/behavior-delta-detection.md`, and the
`source_provider` sub-reference under its `references/` dir).

**Persist:** write the decisions array (entries `{delta_type, location, resolution_chosen,
source}`; `[]` when there were no user-visible deltas) to `$PHASE_DIR/delta-decisions.json`
and validate it (`--schema delta-decisions`). The file must exist before C5 — it is what
makes a C5 retry or a post-crash resume self-sufficient.

### C5 — Rewriter · C6 — Report

| Step | agentType                                       | Output                                            | Schema                                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| C5   | `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-code-rewriter`    | `$PHASE_DIR/rewrite.json`                         | rewrite                                         |
| C6   | `migration-to-aws:llm2bedrock-report-generator` | `MIGRATION_REPORT_<saved suffix>.md` in repo root | (none — file existence is the completion check) |

C5's context block includes the `Confirmed behavior-delta decisions file` line and the
`Report date suffix` line (from run-context, NOT today's date on a resume). C6's context
block lists all four phase-result file paths.

When `rewrite_strategy == "mantle"`, C5's context block ALSO includes:

- `Rewrite strategy: mantle` (omit this line entirely for Converse — its absence is the
  signal for the default Converse path)
- `Mantle model map: <source-model> -> <bedrock-model-id>` — sourced from the plan's
  `ai_architecture.bedrock_models[]` entries (each `source_model` → `aws_model_id` pair).

### C7 — Render summary

```bash
uv run --project $SCRIPTS python $SCRIPTS/render_report.py --phase-results $PHASE_DIR --repo $REPO --date-suffix <saved suffix>
```

Print the summary. Point the user at `rewrite.branch_name` (usually `bedrock-migration`, but
a collision-suffixed variant like `bedrock-migration-2` when they already had that branch)
and the report file. Tell them how to undo — substitute the ACTUAL branch name from
`rewrite.branch_name`, never a hardcoded one (on a collision run, `bedrock-migration` is the
user's own pre-existing branch and deleting it would destroy their work):

> To discard: `git checkout <your original branch>`, `git branch -D <rewrite.branch_name>`,
> `git tag -d saws-migrate-baseline`, and `rm -rf .saws-migrate .migration` removes all
> migration artifacts (including the API key file — also consider rotating the key you pasted).

## Inline mode (platforms without an Agent/subagent dispatch tool)

If this platform has no subagent dispatch tool, run phases inline ONE AT A TIME, with a
mandatory stop between phases:

1. `Read` exactly ONE agent definition (`<plugin>/agents/<name>.md`) — never load more than
   one phase's definition into context at once.
2. Follow it start-to-finish; write and validate the same phase-result file.
3. STOP. Report the phase outcome (validator CONTROL line + one-line summary) and ask the
   user to confirm before loading the next phase's definition. This checkpoint is mandatory:
   it is the context-pressure release valve, and the phase-result file means nothing is lost
   if the user continues in a fresh session instead.

Warn the user up front that inline mode is slower and context-heavier than subagent dispatch,
and that the rewriter phase performs git operations (branch, commits, worktree) directly in
this session.

---

## Failure handling

- An agent dispatch dies (tool error, terminal failure) → the phase file is missing →
  validator exit 2 → the stateless fixer-retry path (which, finding no file to fix, re-runs
  the phase). Do not auto-retry more than the 2-retry cap.
- User aborts at any gate → confirm no SOURCE CODE was modified (C5 never started if aborted
  before then). Note that `.migration/` and `.saws-migrate/` artifacts do exist; show the
  undo commands from C7 if the user wants them gone.
- Assess skill fails → show the error and stop. User can re-run `/migration-to-aws:llm-to-bedrock`.
