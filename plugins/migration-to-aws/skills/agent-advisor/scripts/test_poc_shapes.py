"""Content lock for references/decision-refs/poc-shapes.md.

The POC shapes are markdown-specified deploy contracts. These tests pin the
security- and cost-load-bearing content (create whitelists, auth modes,
fallback rules, the Temporal TLS contract) so a wording "simplification"
cannot silently turn a locked-down POC into a footgun. Matching is
whitespace-normalized throughout (markdown wraps lines).
