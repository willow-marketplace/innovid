# Phase: Design

Assembles the recommendation from the scoring result + Confirm choices + service cards.

## Step 1 — Read inputs

Read `$RUN_DIR/scoring-result.json`, `$RUN_DIR/model-recommendation.json`, and
`$RUN_DIR/confirm.json`. The winning runtime is
`confirm.chosen_runtime` if present (co_recommend pick), else `scoring-result.verdict`. Prefer
`confirm.deployment_model` and `confirm.agentcore_services` over the scoring-result defaults (Confirm
is the user-confirmed set). (Clarify's scope gate guarantees at least one agent_session unit, so a
scored top-level verdict always exists — there is no zero-agent branch.)

If `$RUN_DIR/model-verification.json` exists, read it and attach each workload's matching
record as `live_verification`. Do not infer `passed` from `confirm.model_decision.accepted`;
acceptance and target-account invocability are separate.

## Step 2 — Load the winning runtime's service card

Load ALL THREE files (each is required; do not skip any — Step 4's lock-in check depends on
`managed-alternatives.md` even when no lock-in ends up applying):

1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agent-advisor/references/decision-refs/<verdict>.md` (use
   `lambda-microvms.md` for lambda_microvms; use `ecs.md` for `fargate` — ECS-on-Fargate
   shares the ecs card; `batch` has its own `batch.md`; for co_recommend, load both cards).
   **`serverless_workers` has NO card** — skip this load for it and derive from `temporal.md`
   plus `poc-shapes.md` per the key_change note below.
2. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agent-advisor/references/decision-refs/model-selection.md`
3. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agent-advisor/references/decision-refs/managed-alternatives.md`

## Step 3 — Refresh volatile facts

Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agent-advisor/references/decision-refs/freshness.md` and follow its procedure:
read the winning profile's `volatile_facts`, try awsknowledge MCP for each, fall back to cached
values on failure. Record which succeeded vs fell back (for the freshness footer).

## Step 4 — Provider lock-in check

Determine the managed alternative from the source/current model provider: Claude-committed →
`claude_managed`; OpenAI-committed → `bedrock_managed`; multi-provider or undecided → `none`.
If a managed alternative applies, surface it **as awareness only** (per `managed-alternatives.md`)
with its tradeoffs — do NOT present it as the recommendation. Otherwise note AgentCore supports
all models.

## Step 4b — I/O-wait TCO differentiator (surface proactively)

Most customers don't know AgentCore Runtime (and Harness) bill **$0 during I/O wait** (active
CPU only). Surface this as a TCO advantage — WITHOUT adding a question — when it actually
matters: if `traffic_pattern` is `bursty` or `idle`, OR `session_state` is `hitl`, AND AgentCore
is viable (winning runtime is `agentcore`, or it is in a `co_recommend` set, or it was not
eliminated). Set `io_wait_tco_note = true` in design.json and include a short note for the doc,
e.g.: "Your traffic is spiky / has human-in-the-loop waits — on AgentCore you pay nothing while
the agent waits on the model or a human (active-CPU billing only), which is a real TCO edge vs
always-on compute. Exact numbers come from the migration/pricing plugins." No dollar figures
here. If AgentCore is not viable, omit the note. **The note applies to the microVMs compute
type only** — when `agentcore_compute_type` is `instances`, billing is EC2 in the user's
account plus a management fee (an idle instance costs money unless the session is stopped),
so omit the $0-I/O-wait claim and let the scoring warning carry the pricing caveat instead.

## Step 4c — FedRAMP status (WIP, not a hard block)

If the user's `compliance` includes `fedramp`: AgentCore's FedRAMP authorization is **in progress
(WIP)** — do NOT hard-eliminate AgentCore for it. Verify the current status per `freshness.md`
(the `fedramp` volatile fact, via awsknowledge MCP). Then surface an honest note: "AgentCore's
FedRAMP authorization is in progress — verify the current status before committing. If you need
FedRAMP-authorized compute **today**, GovCloud on ECS/EKS is the safe fallback." Record
`fedramp_note = true` in design.json when this fires. (HIPAA/SOC/PCI/etc. are unaffected —
AgentCore is eligible for those.)

## Step 4d — Region gating (availability + CRIS/GDPR)

Read `region` from answers. Region does NOT change the verdict — it gates two things:

1. **Availability:** if the winning runtime is `agentcore` (or the chosen deployment model is
   Harness), verify it's available in the user's region via the awsknowledge MCP (per
   `freshness.md`; the profile's `regions` volatile fact). If unavailable, surface a note with the
   nearest supported region and — if the gap is blocking — the container fallback. Do NOT silently
   recommend a runtime the user's region can't run. Record `region_availability_note` when it fires.
2. **CRIS / data residency:** if `region` is `multi`/`global` OR the user is in the EU OR
   `compliance` includes `gdpr`, surface the CRIS choice: **geo-CRIS keeps inference within the
   region (data-residency-safe)** vs **global-CRIS may route cross-region (a GDPR risk)**. Present
   it as a compliance decision, not a silent default. Record `cris_note = true`. Exact CRIS/region
   configuration is validated downstream in the migration flow — keep this directional.

## Step 4e — Temporal resolution (when temporal units exist)

When any unit has `workload_class == temporal_worker_poll`:

**Consume Confirm's decision — do NOT re-evaluate Tier 1.** Confirm already resolved every
temporal_worker_poll unit's runtime (including any user AskUserQuestion choice for Tier-1 rules 1
and 4) and persisted it in `confirm.json.resolved_runtimes[<unit_id>]`. Read that value as the
unit's verdict verbatim and cite the fired rule id it recorded in `rationale` (e.g.
"Tier1-R2: team operates K8s → EKS"). Re-running Tier 1 here — especially the OFFER rules — could
pick a different runtime than the one the user confirmed and make `platform_decision` disagree
with `effective_runtime`. Only if `resolved_runtimes` is somehow absent (older run) fall back to
loading `references/decision-refs/temporal.md` and applying the rules in order.

**Way resolution:** the Way comes FIRST from the user's answer
`answers.json.system.temporal_way` (cloud/self_hosted are binding); the Way table in
`references/decision-refs/temporal.md` applies ONLY when it is `undecided`/absent.
Commercials selection deferred to Generate.

Write the `temporal` block when temporal units exist:

```json
{
  "way": "cloud | self_hosted",
  "server_current": "...",
  "per_queue_rules": { "<queue>": "<rule id>" },
  "serverless_workers_status": "Public Preview"
}
```

`temporal.server_current` is read from `context-signals.json.temporal.server` (discover's
output; "unknown" on the declared no-code path). `serverless_workers_status` is set from
this run's freshness check (see freshness.md) — currently `"Public Preview"` — and MUST
NOT be auto-upgraded to GA from a docs label or MCP echo alone.

### Freshness (temporal units only)

Load `references/decision-refs/freshness.md` and run its Temporal section.

**Verification channel for Temporal feature statuses (auth-gated MCP → WebFetch
fallback):** freshness.md's Temporal section names the Temporal Knowledge Base MCP
(`temporal-docs`, which ships in this plugin's `.mcp.json`) as the preferred source,
and defines the auth-gate procedure — follow it exactly. In short: check whether
`temporal-docs` is authenticated this session; if authenticated, query it first; if
registered-but-not-authenticated, **STOP and ask via AskUserQuestion** whether to
authenticate (per freshness.md), and if the user says yes, direct them to `/mcp` and
**wait** for them to finish before continuing. Only if the user declines → WebFetch
the docs.temporal.io page. Ask at most once per run. Pausing here is safe: this step
is a read-only freshness check that resumes cleanly. (The Marketplace listing fact
stays WebFetch-only; the KB MCP does not cover it.)

Non-negotiable regardless of channel: **Serverless Workers is Public Preview, not GA**
— the docs label has moved before without a GA announcement (it read "Available" in
2026-07); do not trust it at face value, re-verify this run and label the output
Public Preview until GA evidence appears. Workflow Streams and External Payload
Storage are Preview. The anti-fabrication rule applies:
only claim verified (whether via MCP or WebFetch) for calls actually made and results
observed this run.

## Step 5 — Assemble design.json

Assemble per unit:

- `agent_session` units: verdict/deployment_model/agentcore_compute_type/services from that
  unit's scoring result + that unit's confirm overrides (compute type is copied verbatim,
  never re-derived — scoring owns the >8h / GPU / instance-type routing); model/path from
  `model-recommendation.json.workloads[<unit_id>]` + the accepted
  `confirm.json.units[<unit_id>].model_decision` — read `confirm.json.units[<unit_id>]`
  (deployment_model, agentcore_services, chosen_runtime, tool_choices) for THIS unit, not a
  global top-level value. For a single-unit run, fall back to confirm.json's top-level fields.
  Each agent unit's confirmed runtime/services are independent — never copy the primary unit's.
  Write the compatibility `model_recommendation` object as
  `{"model": primary_model, "model_identity": ..., "reasoning": rationale joined for display,
  "api_path": api_path, "invocation_model_id": ..., "source": ..., "source_analysis": ...,
  "feature_assessment": ..., "alternatives": ..., "compatibility": ...,
  "architecture_impacts": ..., "additional_targets": ... (copy verbatim when the recommendation
  has them; a separate-modality target with status unresolved must NOT be turned into a runnable
  model id), "blocks": ..., "tuning": ..., "migration_deltas": ...,
  "evaluation": ..., "rollout": ..., "verification": ..., "live_verification": ... | null}`.
  This preserves current report consumers while carrying the complete advisor contract.
  `verification` is the catalog/probe requirement from the recommendation;
  `live_verification` is only populated from the separate probe artifact. Never read the
  scoring result's deprecated coarse model mirror for this field.
  **Every non-agent unit's runtime comes from `confirm.json.resolved_runtimes[<id>]` VERBATIM** —
  Confirm already resolved and (for Temporal rules 1/4) user-confirmed each one, so Design must NOT
  re-run temporal.md Tier 1 or workload-classes.md and risk a different pick than the one behind
  `platform_decision`. The rule references below only say WHICH rule produced that value (for the
  `rationale` cite) and are the fallback when `resolved_runtimes` is absent (older run).

- `temporal_worker_poll` units: verdict = `resolved_runtimes[<id>]` (Confirm's Tier-1 pick; cite
  the rule id it recorded in `rationale`, e.g. "Tier1-R5: default → ECS Fargate"). Fallback only:
  `references/decision-refs/temporal.md` Tier 1. `deployment_model` and `agentcore_services` are
  null; `model_recommendation` is null.
- other units: verdict = `resolved_runtimes[<id>]` (Confirm's workload-classes pick). It MUST be
  the exact runtime enum the fired rule maps to (W1 → `eks` or `ecs`; W2 → `batch`;
  W3 → `lambda`; W4 → `lambda`; W5 → `fargate`; W6 → `fargate`), NOT the prose label. Cite the
  rule id in `rationale` (e.g. "W2: batch → AWS Batch"). Fallback only:
  `references/decision-refs/workload-classes.md`.
  `deployment_model` and `agentcore_services` are null; `model_recommendation` only if
  the unit calls an LLM. The verdict and workload_class must be consistent: a `batch`
  workload_class NEVER has `ecs` verdict unless W1 (existing cluster reuse) fired.

**key_change derivation:** each unit gains a `"key_change"` field — one line extracted from
the winning runtime's "Serving & security notes" section. Derive it by reading the runtime
card's `## Serving & security notes` block and summarizing the entry contract + IAM posture.
Every runtime-card verdict has a card with this block: `agentcore.md`, `ecs.md`, `eks.md`,
`lambda.md`, `lambda-microvms.md`, `batch.md`, and `fargate` → `ecs.md` (ECS-on-Fargate shares
the ecs card). Never fabricate this line — read it from the resolved card.

**Model-less consumption rule (applies when reading ANY service card for a unit whose
`model_recommendation` is null — a non-agent SECONDARY unit in a mixed system):** the cards
describe the common model-bearing case, so their Bedrock-specific items (`bedrock:InvokeModel` in
the IAM posture, Bedrock Guardrails, "calls Bedrock directly", Bedrock egress) DO NOT apply — strip
them from that unit's `key_change` and IAM/networking summary, keeping only the service-specific
permissions (e.g. S3 for a batch job, ALB/networking for a service). Never emit `bedrock:InvokeModel`
or a Bedrock call for a model-less unit even though the card's prose lists it unconditionally. The
same rule governs Generate's use of the card. (A model-bearing unit reads the card as written.)

**`serverless_workers` has NO runtime card** (it is a temporal_worker_poll Tier-1 outcome, not a
scored runtime). Do NOT try to load `serverless_workers.md` in Step 2, and do NOT block on a
missing card. For a `serverless_workers` unit, derive `key_change` from
`references/decision-refs/temporal.md` (the Serverless Workers Tier-1 entry) + the Temporal
worker POC section of `poc-shapes.md` — one line on the worker's connection/env contract — and
label it Public Preview. (Same as the other temporal_worker_poll verdicts, whose cards are the
resolved compute card — ecs/eks — while serverless_workers is Temporal-managed with no AWS
compute card.)

- networking default in one sentence (e.g., "POST /invocations, execution role with InvokeModel,
  public endpoints over TLS"). This gives Generate a load-bearing sentence for the migration's
  operational shift.

**Consolidated does NOT rewrite per-unit `verdict`; it sets `effective_runtime` instead.**
Even when the user chose to consolidate onto a superset (e.g. ECS/EKS), each unit's `verdict`
stays the runtime its own rule produced (agent_session → its scored runtime; non-agent → its
workload-classes token — W2→`batch`, W3/W4→`lambda`, W5/W6→`fargate`). The consolidation lives
in the `platform` block (`mode: "consolidated"`, `runtime: "<superset>"`); it never overwrites
`units[].verdict`. The per-unit verdict records what each unit would run on its own (the report
shows the trade-off consolidation makes).

**Every unit ALSO gets an `effective_runtime` field — the ACTUAL deploy target — computed
here so every downstream phase reads ONE value instead of re-deriving it:**

- `platform.mode == "consolidated"` → `effective_runtime = platform.runtime` (the superset) for
  EVERY unit.
- `platform.mode == "split"` → `effective_runtime =` the unit's **resolved runtime**: when the
  unit's `verdict` is `co_recommend`, that is NOT a runtime — use the `chosen_runtime` the user
  picked in Confirm (`confirm.json.units[<id>].chosen_runtime`, or the top-level `chosen_runtime`
  for a single-unit run); otherwise the unit's `verdict`. `effective_runtime` is ALWAYS a
  concrete runtime enum (agentcore | lambda_microvms | ecs | eks | lambda | batch | fargate |
  serverless_workers) — never the literal `co_recommend`. (`serverless_workers` is a legal
  temporal_worker_poll Tier 1 outcome — Public Preview — and Estimate/POC dispatch on it; it
  MUST be in this enum or a user who accepts Public Preview Serverless Workers gets normalized
  to a wrong runtime.) Also set `units[].verdict` to that resolved runtime for a
  co_recommend unit (record the tie + the pick in `rationale`), so no downstream reader ever
  sees `verdict: "co_recommend"`.

Downstream phases (Estimate cost bands, Generate report + diagram, Migration Plan injection,
POC dispatch) MUST read `unit.effective_runtime` as the deploy/cost/render target, and use
`unit.verdict` only to show the "would-have-been" trade-off. A `content-review` unit with
`workload_class: light_io` under "consolidate onto ECS" therefore has `verdict: "lambda"`
(the `_assert` that verdict equals the workload-classes token still holds) AND
`effective_runtime: "ecs"` (where it actually deploys). In a split run the two are equal.

Each unit also carries its `coupling` object over from `context-signals.json.units[]` (verbatim
— `{ "mode": "queue|api|a2a|none" }`), **falling back to `answers.json.units[<id>].coupling`
when context-signals.json is absent** (a skipped-Discover run whose unit Clarify materialized —
that record carries `coupling`/`trigger`/`description`/`evidence`; use them). A materialized
single unit has `coupling.mode: "none"`. The diagram uses per-unit `coupling.mode` to wire ONLY
the units actually on the queue/gateway (an interconnect of `queue` means at least one queue
coupling exists, not that every unit is coupled), so an independent `none` unit is never linked.

Then the `platform` block: `mode` = `"consolidated" | "split"` from confirm.json's
`platform_decision`; `runtime` from the same; `interconnect` from the units' coupling
(`api`/`a2a` present → `gateway` and add `gateway` + `identity` to `shared_services`;
`queue` → `queue` (name the queue service from discovery evidence — the queue technology
the code uses — defaulting to Amazon SQS when none is detected, no Gateway); all `none`
→ `none`; single unit → `in_process`).
When couplings mix, precedence is gateway (any `api`/`a2a`) > `queue` > `none` — one
interconnect value describes the system.

**Legacy mirror (collapse + compatibility):** the primary unit (identified by
`answers.json.primary_unit`, chosen in Clarify) has its verdict, chosen_runtime,
deployment_model, agentcore_services, and model_recommendation ALSO written at design.json's top
level, exactly as today. The top-level `chosen_runtime` is the primary unit's RESOLVED runtime:
`confirm.json.resolved_runtimes[primary_unit]` (== the co_recommend pick when the primary's
verdict was co_recommend, else its plain verdict). It is always set — for a single-winner verdict
it equals the verdict, so it is never missing. (The primary is always an agent unit per Clarify's
scope gate.) Single-unit
runs therefore produce today's design.json plus a one-element `units` array.

Carry the scoring facts forward so Generate has a deterministic source for "Alternatives
considered" and the "Eliminated" line (Generate reads design.json, not scoring-result.json):

```json
{
  "units": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "workload_class": "...",
      "verdict": "...",
      "effective_runtime": "... (= verdict when split; = platform.runtime when consolidated)",
      "coupling": { "mode": "queue | api | a2a | none (carried over from context-signals.json.units[])" },
      "deployment_model": "...",
      "agentcore_compute_type": "microvms | instances | null (verbatim from this unit's scoring result; instances = capacity-provider EC2 — >8h/GPU/heavy/instance-type workloads)",
      "agentcore_services": [...],
      "model_recommendation": {...},
      "rationale": "...",
      "key_change": "..."
    }
  ],
  "platform": {
    "mode": "consolidated | split",
    "runtime": "ecs | eks | lambda | lambda_microvms | agentcore | null (the consolidation superset = the runtime satisfying every unit's hard constraints with the highest summed score, null when split; in practice usually ECS/EKS, but any qualifying runtime is legal — Lambda/Lambda MicroVMs for an all-agent system that fits them, AgentCore only when every unit is agent_session)",
    "interconnect": "in_process | gateway | queue | none",
    "shared_services": [...]
  },
  "verdict": "...", "chosen_runtime": "...", "deployment_model": "...",
  "agentcore_compute_type": "microvms | instances | null",
  "agentcore_services": [...], "model_recommendation": {...}, "warnings": [...],
  "scores": {...}, "eliminated": {...}, "blocking_constraints": [...],
  "volatile_facts": {"microvms_session_cap": {"value": "8h", "source": "mcp|cached"},
                     "instances_session_cap": {"value": "14d", "source": "mcp|cached"}},
  "managed_alternative": "claude_managed | bedrock_managed | none",
  "io_wait_tco_note": true|false,
  "fedramp_note": true|false,
  "region_availability_note": "... | null",
  "cris_note": true|false,
  "handoff_required": true|false
}
```

Copy `scores`, `eliminated`, and (if present) `blocking_constraints` verbatim from
scoring-result.json. Set `handoff_required` = true when **ANY unit's `effective_runtime` needs a
downstream compute handoff — i.e. is one of `ecs`, `eks`, `fargate`, or `batch`** — not just the
primary unit's winning runtime. These runtimes hand the compute layer to migration-to-aws (their
service cards say so: ecs.md, eks.md, batch.md, and fargate = ECS). AgentCore, standard Lambda,
and Lambda MicroVMs are self-contained. So a system whose primary unit is AgentCore but which has
a secondary Fargate/Batch/ECS/EKS unit — OR which consolidated onto ECS/EKS — still needs the
handoff. Scan every `units[].effective_runtime`; if any is in {ecs, eks, fargate, batch},
`handoff_required` = true; a system with none of its units on those has `handoff_required` =
false. (For migrate, Generate ends with the migration-plan gate — the user chooses between an
in-skill migration plan and the classic downstream handoff; that's an entry-point behavior
in Step 6, independent of `handoff_required`.)

## Step 6 — Branch on entry point

- entry_point == migrate → set `phases.design` = completed and continue to **Estimate**, then
  Generate. The user gets the same recommendation doc + architecture diagram
  as Build paths; Generate then offers the migration-plan gate (Gate 1) at the end — in-skill plan or classic
  handoff. Estimate runs on migrate too — it produces the target-state run cost per unit; the
  migration TCO comparison stays with the Migration Plan engine.
- otherwise → set `phases.design` = completed and continue to Estimate.

## Maturity/readiness and provisional-verification extension

Load `references/decision-refs/maturity-readiness.md` with the design inputs. Copy `target_maturity`, `readiness`, `recommendation_status`, and `deferred_verification_requirements` from the run artifacts into `design.json`, preserving the release and evaluation gates applicable to the tier. A `provisional` recommendation is not a launch approval: state the unresolved constraint, verification key, owner, and blocking decision explicitly.

This supersedes the unconditional statement in Step 4b: include an AgentCore I/O-wait billing advantage only if the sibling `$RUN_DIR/current-run-verifications.json` artifact is schema-valid, its `run_id` matches `$RUN_DIR`, and its `agentcore.io_wait_billing` record has `status: "verified"` with a source-backed observed value from this run. Never read or write verification evidence through `answers.json`. Without validated current-run evidence, say only that the billing behavior requires current verification and do not make a comparative billing claim.
