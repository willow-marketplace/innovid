# Phase: Add Capabilities (branch)

Reached when the Turn-1 entry point is `add_capabilities`: the user already runs
an agent on AWS and wants to add AgentCore services. **No runtime scoring** —
services run on any runtime. This is a self-contained branch: it does NOT pass
through Clarify / Confirm / Design / Estimate / Generate.

## Step 0 — Create the run directory

Generate a run id from the current time as `MMDD-HHMM`. Create the run directory under the
**user's current working directory** (run `pwd` and anchor to it) — NOT the plugin install tree:
`<cwd>/.agent-advisor/<run_id>/`, plus `<cwd>/.agent-advisor/.gitignore` containing `*` (so run
state is never committed). Call this directory `$RUN_DIR`.

## Step 1 — Current runtime

Ask which runtime they run on now: AgentCore / ECS / EKS / Lambda / other. (If the user already
stated it in their opening message, skip this question.)

## Step 2 — Capabilities needed (multi-select)

Identity, Gateway, Memory, Policy, Observability, Managed KB, Code Interpreter, Browser,
Web Search, Sandbox. For each selected, load the relevant section of
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agent-advisor/references/decision-refs/agentcore.md`.

## Step 3 — Native vs bring-your-own

If they already use a third-party tool for a capability (Tavily/Pinecone/Browserbase/etc),
present: switch to AgentCore native, or keep existing and connect via Gateway.

## Step 4 — Volatile facts

Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/agent-advisor/references/decision-refs/freshness.md`. This
branch has no winning runtime profile, so verify the relevant "Hard limits" facts from
`agentcore.md` directly (per freshness.md Procedure step 1). Follow its anti-fabrication rule:
only list a fact as MCP-verified if you actually called the MCP this run; otherwise it's cached.

## Step 5 — Output

Write the recommendation to `$RUN_DIR/capabilities-recommendation.md` (so the user can keep and
share it — consistent with the main skill's `recommendation.md`). Include:

- **Current runtime** and the capabilities requested.
- **Services to enable** — for each: what it does, why it fits, and (Identity) that it's free.
- **Native vs bring-your-own** outcome per capability (from Step 3): which go AgentCore-native
  and which stay third-party fronted via Gateway.
- **Integration on the current runtime** — concrete setup pointers (IAM/task-role changes, SDK
  calls, endpoints) for the user's runtime; note these services are standalone and require no
  runtime/compute change.
- **Suggested enablement order.**
- **Freshness footer** (per `freshness.md`: generation date, which facts were MCP-verified vs
  cached).

Then give a short in-chat summary and point the user to `$RUN_DIR/capabilities-recommendation.md`.
This branch does not score runtimes or hand off — it ends here. Set
`phases.add_capabilities` = completed (state → `complete`).
