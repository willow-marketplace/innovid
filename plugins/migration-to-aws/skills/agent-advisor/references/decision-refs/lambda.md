# AWS Lambda (standard) — Service Card

## One-liner

Event-driven functions, scale to zero, cheapest for short stateless tasks.

## Best for

Seconds-long, stateless, event-driven agent tasks (single tool call, classification).

## Hard limits

- Execution timeout: 15 minutes (eliminates it for minutes-to-hours sessions)

## Six dimensions

- Identity: IAM
- Observability: CloudWatch
- Guardrails: bring-your-own + Bedrock Guardrails
- Scaling: automatic, scale to zero
- Tool/Gateway: AgentCore services available as add-ons
- Protocols: invoke / function URL

## Tradeoffs

15-minute hard cap; no long sessions, no cross-session memory without external state.
Hands off to migration-to-aws for compute-layer config.
