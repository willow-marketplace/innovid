# Phase 4: Estimate AWS Costs

## Orientation

Calculate projected monthly AWS costs for the designed Heroku-to-AWS architecture,
producing `estimation-infra.json` (conforming to
`references/vendored/estimate/estimation-infra.schema.json`) and classifying
migration complexity using the tier thresholds in
`references/vendored/estimate/complexity-tiers.json`.

Composed of a cost-engine fragment + one assembler (declared in the frontmatter
`_fragments`/`_assemble`); the interpreter runs the fragment, then the assembler,
and evaluates the `_knowledge` guards to load the pricing/defaults/tier data. The
fragment selects the pricing mode and computes the financial picture; the assembler
writes the final artifact, runs the completion gate, presents the summary, and
**offers the optional what-if workshop sidebar**
(`references/phases/workshop/workshop.md`, `_kind: sidebar`) before Generate —
read each unit file for its own contract. Outer Estimate defers
`current_phase → generate` until workshop is resolved (see `estimate-assemble.md`).

## Scope Boundary

**This phase covers financial analysis ONLY.**

FORBIDDEN — Do NOT include ANY of:

- Changes to architecture mappings from Phase 3 (Design)
- Execution timelines or migration schedules (beyond tier classification)
- Terraform or IaC code generation
- Detailed migration procedures or runbooks
- Team staffing, human labor costs, or professional services fees
- AI workload estimation (not applicable to Heroku migrations)

**Your ONLY job: Show the financial picture of moving from Heroku to AWS. Nothing else.**
