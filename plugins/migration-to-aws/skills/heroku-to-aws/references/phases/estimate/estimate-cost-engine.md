# Estimate Phase: Cost Engine

> Self-contained cost-calculation sub-file. Selects the pricing mode, validates the
> design inputs, and computes the full financial picture: current Heroku costs,
> projected AWS costs (per-service + tiers), observability, comparison, migration
> considerations, ROI, optimization opportunities, complexity tier, and the
> recommendation. The final artifact write, handoff gate, and phase-status update
> are owned by the assembler (`estimate-assemble.md`).

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

---

## Step 0: Pricing Mode Selection

Execute `references/vendored/estimate/pricing-mode.md` (the canonical
Step 0, vendored from `skills/shared/estimate/pricing-mode.md` and kept
byte-identical by `shared:sync`) as this step: cache staleness check, MCP
retry ladder, pricing-mode display, and the per-service pricing hierarchy
(including the `estimated` and `unavailable` rungs). Do not restate or
fork that logic here.

For typical Heroku migrations (Elastic Beanstalk, Fargate, RDS, Aurora, ElastiCache, ALB, NAT Gateway, S3, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, EventBridge, SES, OpenSearch, MQ), ALL prices are in `aws-infra-pricing.json`. Zero MCP calls needed.

---

## Step 1: Prerequisites

The entry gate (design completed, inputs present + valid JSON, non-empty
`services[]`) is enforced by this phase's `_preconditions` frontmatter per
`INTERPRETER.md` § Gate protocol — it has already passed before this fragment
runs. Then:

1. Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/heroku-resource-inventory.json`. Extract `billing_profile` section (may be null/absent).

Proceed to Part 1.

---

## Part 1: Determine Current Heroku Costs

Use the best available source for Heroku monthly baseline (first match wins):

1. **`billing_profile` in inventory (preferred)** — Use actual billing data as the Heroku baseline. Highest confidence.
   - Extract `billing_profile.total_monthly_cost` as the total
   - Extract `billing_profile.line_items[]` for per-app breakdown
   - Set `current_costs.source: "billing_data"`

2. **Live-captured prices + dyno cache** — If no billing data AND at least one
   add-on resource carries `config.monthly_price_usd` (the account's actual
   billed plan rates from the Platform API capture). The gate is the presence of
   live prices, not merely that live discovery ran: a live run that captured
   ZERO priced add-ons (e.g. a dyno-only app) has nothing live-priced in it —
   fall to rung 3, whose `pricing_cache` label and ±5% accuracy describe that
   baseline honestly.
   - **Add-ons:** sum `config.monthly_price_usd` across add-on resources — these
     are exact, and they price plans the cache has never heard of (no
     `"unpriced_heroku"` holes for priced add-ons)
   - **Dynos:** the API does not price formations; look up each formation's
     `dyno_type` in `references/shared/heroku-pricing-cache.md` (±5% published
     flat rates) × `quantity`
   - Set `current_costs.source: "live_prices_plus_cache"`
   - Set `current_costs.accuracy: "exact for add-ons, ±5% for dynos"`
   - An add-on WITHOUT `monthly_price_usd` (e.g. a Terraform-only entry) falls
     through to the rung-3 cache lookup for that resource only; if neither
     prices it, mark `"unpriced_heroku"` and add to warnings
   - `baseline_note` (mandatory): "Derived from your account's actual add-on
     prices plus published dyno rates — not an invoice. Excludes usage-based
     charges (bandwidth, build minutes), team seats, credits, and discounts;
     your invoice may differ."

3. **Heroku pricing cache** — If no billing data and no live-captured prices, Load `references/shared/heroku-pricing-cache.md` and derive costs from discovered resources:
   - For each resource in inventory, look up its plan in the cache tables (case-insensitive exact match)
   - Multiply dyno costs by `formation.quantity`
   - Sum all matched resources to get `heroku_monthly_estimated`
   - Set `current_costs.source: "pricing_cache"`
   - Set `current_costs.accuracy: "±5%"`
   - If any resource plan is not found in cache, mark as `"unpriced_heroku"` and exclude from total; add to warnings

4. **User-provided** — If neither live prices nor the pricing cache match any resource (unlikely with Terraform or live discovery), ask: "I need your current Heroku monthly spend to produce a meaningful cost comparison. What is your approximate Heroku monthly cost?" Use the answer.
   - Set `current_costs.source: "user_provided"`

5. **Unavailable** — If user declines: present AWS costs without Heroku comparison.
   - Set `current_costs.source: "unavailable"`
   - Note: "Heroku baseline unavailable — AWS costs shown without comparison."

Whenever a baseline was determined (any source except `"unavailable"`), present it as:

- Total monthly cost, with its source and accuracy stated plainly (invoice data vs actual plan prices vs rate card vs user estimate)
- Per-app breakdown (dyno, add-on, platform charges)
- Billing period (billing-data source only) or `baseline_note` (derived sources)

## Part 2: Calculate Projected AWS Costs

For each service in `aws-design.json → services[]`, calculate monthly cost by applying the formula from the Per-Service Calculation Formulas table below, looking up its rates from `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json`. Track `pricing_source` per service. (`hours_per_month` = 730, from `_meta`.)

### Per-Service Calculation Formulas

Rates below come from the named keys in `aws-infra-pricing.json` — do not hardcode them here. The formula shape + key inputs are shown for reference.

| AWS Service               | Formula (rates from `aws-infra-pricing.json`)                                                                                                            | Key inputs from `aws_config`                                                  |

| **RDS PostgreSQL**        | `rds_postgresql.instances[class]` × 730 + storage_gb × `rds_postgresql.storage_per_gb_month` (rate is baked_in Multi-AZ — do NOT double)                 | `instance_class`, `storage_gb`, `multi_az`                                    |
| **Aurora PostgreSQL**     | `aurora_postgresql.instances[class]` × 730 + storage_gb × `aurora_postgresql.storage_per_gb_month` + I/O estimate (intrinsic multi-AZ)                   | `instance_class`, `storage_gb`                                                |
| **ElastiCache Redis**     | `elasticache.nodes[type]` × 730 (× 2 if Multi-AZ — `multiplier_x2`)                                                                                      | `node_type`, `multi_az`                                                       |
| **MSK**                   | `msk.brokers[type]` × 730 × broker_count + storage_gb × `msk.storage_per_gb_month` (intrinsic multi-AZ)                                                  | `broker_instance_type`, `broker_count`, `storage_per_broker_gb`               |
| **CloudWatch Logs**       | log_volume_gb × `cloudwatch.log_ingestion_per_gb` + storage × `cloudwatch.log_storage_per_gb_month`                                                      | `retention_days`, estimated log volume                                        |
| **S3**                    | storage_gb × `fast_path_services.s3.storage_per_gb_month` + request estimates (or `s3.monthly_baseline_est`)                                             | `storage_gb` (from Bucketeer/Cloudinary mapping)                              |

| **EventBridge Scheduler** | `fast_path_services.eventbridge.monthly_baseline_est` (flat; per_million_events basis)                                                                   | From Heroku Scheduler mapping                                                 |

| **NAT Gateway**           | `nat_gateway.monthly_fixed` + data processing estimate (`nat_gateway.per_gb_processed`)                                                                  | From VPC design (if new VPC)                                                  |

### Unpriced Resource Handling

IF pricing data for a service is unavailable from both MCP and cache:

1. Mark the resource's cost as `"unpriced"` in the per-service breakdown
2. **Exclude** from the total monthly cost sum
3. Add to `warnings[]`: "Pricing unavailable for [service_id] ([aws_service]). Requires manual cost verification."
4. Add service name to `pricing_source.services_with_missing_fallback[]`

### EKS Cost Calculation

When `aws-design.json` contains EKS services (`aws_service: "EKS"`):

1. **EKS Control Plane**: `eks.control_plane_monthly` (fixed, one cluster regardless of node count)
2. **EC2 Node Group**: Look up the node instance type's monthly rate in `eks.node_rates_monthly[type]` × `desired_size` nodes. The monthly rates (m6i.large, m6i.xlarge, m6i.4xlarge, r6i.4xlarge, m6i.8xlarge, m6i.16xlarge) are maintained in `aws-infra-pricing.json` — do not hardcode them here.
3. **ALB for web services**: Same as Fargate ALB pricing (`alb.monthly_fixed` per web service)
4. **NAT Gateway** (if private subnets): Same as Fargate path (`nat_gateway.monthly_fixed` + data processing)

**Total EKS monthly cost** = `eks.control_plane_monthly` + (node_monthly_rate × node_count) + ALB_costs + NAT_costs. Pods are NOT charged a per-task cost (compute is billed via the EC2 nodes); ALB and NAT are the separate lines above, not re-added here.

### Elastic Beanstalk Cost Calculation

When `aws-design.json` contains Elastic Beanstalk services (`aws_service: "Elastic Beanstalk"`):

1. **EC2 instances**: Look up the instance type's hourly rate in `ec2.instances[instance_type]` × 730 hours × the running instance estimate. For the Balanced tier, use steady-state `min_instances` so EB and Fargate comparisons use comparable running-capacity assumptions. Show `max_instances` as scaling headroom, not as 730 hours of guaranteed spend.
2. **ALB** (LoadBalanced environments only): use the same ALB formula as standalone ALB entries: `alb.monthly_fixed` plus an LCU estimate. SingleInstance non-web environments do NOT incur ALB cost.
3. **EBS storage**: EC2 On-Demand pricing does not include EBS root volumes. Add per instance: `ebs.gp3_per_gb_month` × (`aws_config.root_volume_gb` when the design specifies one, else `ebs.eb_root_volume_gb_default`) × the running instance estimate. Do not claim a 30GB EC2 allowance.
4. **NAT Gateway**: If the VPC design places EB instances in private subnets that require outbound internet access, include the same NAT Gateway line used by the other compute paths.

**Total EB monthly cost** = (EC2_hourly × 730 × running_instance_estimate) + ALB_costs (web only) + applicable networking/storage supporting costs. EB itself charges $0 — all costs are the underlying resources.

**EB vs Fargate cost comparison note**: When presenting EB estimates alongside a Fargate alternative, disclose that EB pricing is EC2-instance based while Fargate pricing is task-size based. Use comparable running-capacity assumptions for the Balanced tier.

**EKS vs Fargate cost comparison note**: When presenting EKS estimates alongside the Heroku baseline, include this note:

> "EKS with EC2 nodes is typically cheaper than Fargate for sustained workloads (>60% utilization) because there is no per-pod Fargate surcharge. However, EKS has a higher base cost (`eks.control_plane_monthly` control plane + minimum 2 nodes) and requires Kubernetes operational expertise."

### Cost Tier Calculation

Calculate 3 cost tiers to show the optimization range:

| Tier          | Description              | Adjustments                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premium**   | Highest resilience       | Multi-AZ everything, latest-gen instances, no Spot, enhanced monitoring                                                    |
| **Balanced**  | Standard setup (default) | On-demand pricing, Multi-AZ where configured, standard monitoring                                                          |
| **Optimized** | Cost-minimized           | Reserved pricing assumption (20-40% discount), Spot for interruption-tolerant workers (EB or Fargate), S3-IA for cold data |

**Balanced** is the primary comparison tier. Generated Terraform (Phase 5) aligns with **Balanced**.

### Total Cost Calculation

```
total_monthly = sum(individual_resource_costs) — excluding "unpriced" resources
```

Verify: total equals the arithmetic sum of all individually calculated resource costs. This is the **Property 16** invariant.

---

## Part 2B: Observability Cost Estimation (CloudWatch)

Heroku includes basic logging via its log drain. AWS CloudWatch charges from the first GB. This section ensures observability costs are not a surprise.

### Step 1: Estimate Log Volume

Use the per-service log-volume heuristic from [`knowledge/estimate/estimate-defaults.json`](../../../knowledge/estimate/estimate-defaults.json) → `log_volume_gb_per_service` (billing data not applicable for log volume since Heroku's logging model differs). Keyed by service: `fargate_task` (per task), `eb_environment` (per Elastic Beanstalk environment), `rds_or_aurora_instance` (per instance), `alb` (per load balancer), `nat_gateway` (per gateway), `elasticache_node` (per node), `msk_broker` (per broker).

Sum across all applicable services.

### Step 2: Estimate Custom Metrics and Alarms

- `custom_metrics_count = (number of services in aws-design.json × 5)`
- Default floor: 10 custom metrics
- `alarm_count = max(5, number_of_services × 2)` (baseline health/error/latency)

### Step 3: Calculate CloudWatch Costs

```
log_ingestion_cost    = monthly_log_gb × cloudwatch.log_ingestion_per_gb
log_storage_cost      = monthly_log_gb × cloudwatch.log_storage_per_gb_month × retention_months (use preferences.operational.log_retention_days / 30, default: 1)
custom_metrics_cost   = custom_metrics_count × cloudwatch.custom_metric_month
alarms_cost           = alarm_count × cloudwatch.standard_alarm_month
tracing_cost          = 0 (do not add X-Ray costs unless tracing detected in source)

total_observability   = log_ingestion_cost + log_storage_cost + custom_metrics_cost + alarms_cost + tracing_cost
```

(All `cloudwatch.*` rates are in `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json`.)

### Step 4: Add Observability Entry

Add to `projected_costs.breakdown`:

```json
{
  "service": "CloudWatch + X-Ray (Observability)",
  "low": "<total × 0.7>",
  "mid": "<total>",
  "high": "<total × 1.5>",
  "accuracy": "±30%",
  "pricing_source": "cached",
  "components": {
    "log_ingestion": "<log_ingestion_cost>",
    "log_storage": "<log_storage_cost>",
    "custom_metrics": "<custom_metrics_cost>",
    "alarms": "<alarms_cost>",
    "tracing": "<tracing_cost>"
  },
  "volume_source": "heuristic",
  "note": "Heroku includes basic logging at no extra charge. CloudWatch charges from the first GB. Actual costs depend on log verbosity and retention."
}
```

This entry REPLACES any CloudWatch entries in a "Supporting" row — never double-count.

## Part 3: Cost Comparison (Heroku vs AWS)

### When a Heroku Baseline Was Determined (any Part 1 source except `"unavailable"`)

The comparison is the point of this phase — it runs whenever Part 1 produced a
baseline, from ANY source. Do not reserve it for billing data: a
`live_prices_plus_cache` or `pricing_cache` baseline yields the same side-by-side
with its accuracy labeled honestly.

Present a side-by-side comparison:

- **Heroku current monthly total** (from Part 1's baseline, labeled with `current_costs.source` and its accuracy; when derived rather than invoiced, repeat the `baseline_note` caveat next to the number)
- **AWS Premium / Balanced / Optimized monthly totals**
- **Difference** (savings or increase) per tier vs Heroku — monthly and annual
- **Per-app breakdown** for the Balanced tier: for each Heroku app, show:
  - Current Heroku spend — from `billing_profile.line_items` filtered by app
    (billing source), or from that app's summed live prices + cache dyno rates
    (derived sources)
  - Projected AWS spend (sum of services mapped from that app)
  - Difference

Include in `estimation-infra.json`:

```json
"cost_comparison": {
  "heroku_monthly_baseline": "<Part 1 baseline total>",
  "baseline_source": "<current_costs.source>",
  "option_a_premium": {
    "aws_monthly": "<premium total>",
    "monthly_difference": "<premium - heroku>",
    "annual_difference": "<(premium - heroku) × 12>",
    "percent_change": "<+/-X%>"
  },
  "option_b_balanced": {
    "aws_monthly": "<balanced total>",
    "monthly_difference": "<balanced - heroku>",
    "annual_difference": "<(balanced - heroku) × 12>",
    "percent_change": "<+/-X%>"
  },
  "option_c_optimized": {
    "aws_monthly": "<optimized total>",
    "monthly_difference": "<optimized - heroku>",
    "annual_difference": "<(optimized - heroku) × 12>",
    "percent_change": "<+/-X%>"
  }
}
```

### When NO Baseline Was Determined (`current_costs.source == "unavailable"`)

Omit the `cost_comparison` section or set `heroku_monthly_baseline` to null. Present AWS costs without comparison. State: "Heroku baseline unavailable — showing projected AWS costs only. Run live discovery (or provide Heroku invoices) and re-run to see the side-by-side comparison."

---

## Part 4: Migration Cost Considerations

Heroku does not charge egress fees for data transfer during migration (unlike GCP). However, there may be time-based costs during parallel operation.

Key this section off baseline presence (any Part 1 source except `"unavailable"`), not billing data specifically — a derived baseline prices the dual-run window just as well, with the same accuracy caveat as the baseline itself.

### IF a Heroku baseline WAS determined:

```json
"migration_cost_considerations": {
  "baseline_available": true,
  "baseline_source": "<current_costs.source>",
  "categories": [
    "Heroku platform fees during parallel operation (both Heroku and AWS running simultaneously during cutover window): ~<Part 1 baseline total>/month for the duration of the cutover"
  ],
  "note": "Heroku charges are subscription-based. During migration, both Heroku and AWS costs apply until Heroku apps are decommissioned. No data transfer egress fees from Heroku."
}
```

When the baseline is derived (`live_prices_plus_cache` or `pricing_cache`), append to the note: "Dual-run figure is derived from plan prices, not invoices — actual parallel-operation cost may differ by usage-based charges."

### IF NO baseline was determined (`current_costs.source == "unavailable"`):

```json
"migration_cost_considerations": {
  "baseline_available": false,
  "baseline_source": "unavailable",
  "categories": [],
  "note": "Parallel operation costs depend on Heroku spend. Run live discovery (or provide Heroku invoices) for dual-run cost projections."
}
```

## Part 5: ROI Analysis

Present monthly and annual cost difference between Heroku baseline and each AWS tier.

- If AWS is cheaper: present monthly and annual savings per tier
- If AWS is more expensive: state clearly and justify with operational benefits

**Operational efficiency factors (qualitative — do not assign dollar values):**

- Full infrastructure control (VPC, security groups, IAM policies)
- Auto-scaling granularity (Fargate service scaling, Aurora auto-scaling)
- Broader AWS service integration (Step Functions, EventBridge, SNS/SQS)
- Cost optimization levers unavailable on Heroku (Spot, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances)
- Reduced vendor lock-in risk

**Non-cost benefits:**

- Global infrastructure (25+ AWS regions vs Heroku's limited regions)
- Compliance certifications (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP) built into AWS services
- Enterprise integration (Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, Organizations)
- Service breadth (200+ AWS services for future workloads)
- Scaling flexibility (auto-scaling, reserved capacity, burst pricing)

## Part 6: Cost Optimization Opportunities

Present applicable optimizations with estimated savings. These are **incremental post-migration actions** beyond the Balanced on-demand baseline.

The savings ranges + applicability come from [`knowledge/estimate/estimate-defaults.json`](../../../knowledge/estimate/estimate-defaults.json) → `optimization_savings_ranges` (keys: `compute_savings_plans`, `database_savings_plans`, `rds_reserved_instances`, `s3_intelligent_tiering`, `fargate_spot`, `ec2_spot`; each carries `savings_percent` / `target_services` / `timing`). Include ONLY opportunities relevant to the designed architecture (per each entry's `target_services` / `timing`).

**Emit in `optimization_opportunities[]`:**

  "prerequisite": "Worker tasks must be fault-tolerant and idempotent",
  "description": "Heroku worker dynos mapped to Fargate can use Spot pricing for background/batch work that tolerates interruption."
}
```

## Part 7: Complexity Tier Classification

Load the tier thresholds declared in `_knowledge` (`references/vendored/estimate/complexity-tiers.json`). Classify using these inputs from the current artifacts:

| Input                | Source                                                                            | Key                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Service count        | `aws-design.json`                                                                 | `metadata.total_services`                                                                             |
| Monthly spend        | `estimation-infra.json` (just calculated) or `billing_profile.total_monthly_cost` | Projected AWS balanced monthly                                                                        |
| Has databases        | `aws-design.json → services[]`                                                    | `aws_service` in {RDS PostgreSQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, Amazon MQ, Amazon OpenSearch} |
| Has stateful storage | `aws-design.json → services[]`                                                    | `aws_service` in {S3} with replication hints                                                          |
| Availability         | `preferences.json`                                                                | `global.availability`                                                                                 |
| Compliance           | `preferences.json`                                                                | `global.compliance`                                                                                   |

**Evaluate from Large down to Small (first match wins):**

### Large — ANY of:

- Service count ≥ 9
- Monthly spend > $10,000
- Multi-region deployment (services span 2+ AWS regions)
- Compliance requirements present (`compliance` is not `"none"`)

### Medium — NOT Large, and ANY of:

- Service count 4–8
- Monthly spend $1,000–$10,000
- Has databases
- Availability is `"multi-az"` or `"multi-az-ha"`

### Small — NOT Large, NOT Medium (ALL of):

- Service count ≤ 3
- Monthly spend < $1,000
- No databases or stateful storage with replication
- Availability is `"single-az"` or unspecified
- No compliance requirements

Include in `estimation-infra.json`:

```json
{
  "complexity_tier": "small|medium|large",
  "complexity_inputs": {
    "service_count": "<N>",
    "monthly_spend": "<projected balanced>",
    "has_databases": true|false,
    "has_stateful_storage": true|false,
    "availability": "<from preferences>",
    "compliance": "<from preferences>",
    "multi_region": true|false
  }
}
```

**Timeline guidance** (infrastructure path):

| Tier   | Weeks | Approach                            |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Small  | 2-6   | Compressed                          |
| Medium | 6-12  | Phased cluster migration            |
| Large  | 12-18 | Phased cluster migration (extended) |

---

## Part 8: Recommendation

Present 3 paths:

1. **Migrate with Optimizations (Best ROI)** — optimized service choices, projected savings
2. **Phased Migration (Lower Risk)** — app-by-app per design order, validate each before proceeding
3. **Stay on Heroku (Lowest Complexity)** — only if AWS is more expensive and costs are the sole metric

Include migrate/stay decision factors:

- **Migrate if:** infrastructure control matters, AWS-specific services needed, compliance requirements exceed Heroku's offerings, scaling beyond Heroku limits, long-term cost optimization (Savings Plans, Spot)
- **Stay if:** cost is the only metric and AWS is more expensive, team benefits from Heroku's managed simplicity, no need for AWS-specific services, migration risk exceeds benefit

### Persist recommendation to estimation-infra.json

```json
"recommendation": {
  "path": "migrate_optimized|migrate_phased|stay",
  "path_label": "Migrate with Optimizations|Phased Migration|Stay on Heroku",
  "roi_justification": "<one-sentence ROI case>",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "migrate_if": ["<factors specific to THIS stack>"],
  "stay_if": ["<factors specific to THIS stack>"],
  "next_steps": ["<actionable items>"]
}
```

**Path selection logic:**

| Scenario                                     | `path` value          | `path_label`                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| AWS cheaper or operational benefits justify  | `"migrate_optimized"` | `"Migrate with Optimizations"` |
| Complex stack, app-by-app safer              | `"migrate_phased"`    | `"Phased Migration"`           |
| AWS more expensive AND costs are sole metric | `"stay"`              | `"Stay on Heroku"`             |

When Parts 1–8 are complete, control passes to the assembler (`estimate-assemble.md`) to
write `estimation-infra.json`, run the handoff gate, and update phase status.

## Pricing Recipes (MCP Fallback Only)

Only use these recipes when a service is NOT in `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json` and MCP is available. Do NOT call `get_pricing_service_codes` or `get_pricing_service_attributes` — go directly to `get_pricing`.

| AWS Service       | service_code      | filters                                                                                                     | output_options                                                                                                                                     |

**Batching rule:** Group up to 4 MCP requests in parallel per turn.

**Important notes:**

- **Aurora**: Use `deploymentOption=Single-AZ` — Aurora handles multi-AZ natively, no "Multi-AZ" pricing option
- **Fargate**: Use `productFamily=Compute`, NOT EC2-style filters
- **CloudWatch**: Filter by `usagetype=DataProcessing-Bytes` for log ingestion pricing
