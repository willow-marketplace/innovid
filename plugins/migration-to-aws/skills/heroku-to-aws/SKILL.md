# Heroku-to-AWS Migration Skill

## Philosophy

- **Full platform exit by default**: Heroku is in sustaining engineering (KTLO) — stability and support only, no new investment. Enterprise contracts are no longer sold to new customers. This skill assumes complete departure from Heroku (compute, data, and add-ons) within a user-defined window. Do not recommend indefinite continued use of Heroku.
- **PaaS-to-PaaS by default, recommendation-shaped**: Elastic Beanstalk (Docker platform, AL2023) is the default compute target because it preserves Heroku's managed platform model (source deployment, platform-managed environments, and lower operational burden than direct container orchestration). Clarify presents a per-formation compute recommendation before asking for confirmation. Fargate remains the override for direct container control and is used automatically for horizontally scaled non-web processes that EB SingleInstance cannot preserve; EKS remains the override for teams with Kubernetes expertise. ECS Express Mode may be mentioned only as a forward-look for the Fargate override path, not as a replacement for the EB default. Do not recommend AWS App Runner (no longer accepting new customers as of April 2026).
- **Interim cutover is bounded**: If a user chooses data-first migration (database on AWS, app temporarily on Heroku), treat this as a bounded phase (weeks, not quarters). Require a target exit date and surface KTLO platform risk warnings.
- **Re-platform by default**: Select AWS services that match Heroku workload types (e.g., Dynos → Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku Postgres → RDS/Aurora, Heroku Redis → ElastiCache, Kafka → MSK).
- **Dev sizing unless specified**: Default to development-tier capacity (e.g., db.t4g.micro, single AZ). Upgrade only on user direction.
- **No human one-time migration costs**: Do not present human labor, professional services, or people-time work as dollar estimates or "one-time migration cost" budget categories. Vendor charges grounded in data (for example Heroku invoice line items in the infra estimate when billing exists) are allowed.
- **Live-first discovery, read-only and consent-gated**: The user's authenticated Heroku CLI is a first-class discovery source — most startups have no `heroku_*` Terraform, and the account is authoritative for what actually runs. Live capture is strictly read-only (an exact-command whitelist of list/info commands), requires explicit consent, never captures config var values (key names only), and never extracts the API token. Terraform files (`.tf` with `heroku_*` resources) and repo artifacts (Procfile, app.json) remain fully supported; when both live and Terraform data exist, live wins for current state, Terraform supplements structure and provenance, and disagreements are surfaced as drift — never silently resolved.
- **Flat resource model**: Heroku resources are organized per-app without dependency graphs or clustering. No topological sorting, typed edges, or cluster formation logic. Resources are processed as a flat list in input order.
- **Deterministic mappings**: Core services use fixed lookup tables (Dyno Type Table, Postgres Plan Table, Redis Plan Table, Kafka Plan Table). Common add-ons use the Fast-Path Table. Unknown add-ons hit the specialist gate.
- **DMS has Heroku constraints**: AWS DMS cannot perform continuous replication (CDC) with Heroku Postgres because Heroku does not grant the REPLICATION role. DMS is for one-time bulk migration with a cutover window only. The skill must surface this constraint when DMS is selected.
- **What-if after Estimate**: After costs are computed, SAs can enter an optional what-if workshop sidebar (`references/phases/workshop/workshop.md`) to change region, HA, compute target, or CPU architecture (x86 vs Graviton), refresh Design + Estimate, and compare up to 5 priced scenarios — without re-running Discover. Region dollar deltas need awspricing MCP; without it, rates stay us-east-1-cache-based. Workshop arch defaults to **x86_64** here (EB tables historically x86-first).

## Definitions

- **"Load"** = Read the file using the Read tool and follow its instructions. Do not summarize or skip sections.
- **`$MIGRATION_DIR`** = The run-specific directory under `.migration/` (e.g., `.migration/0315-1030/`). Set during Phase 1 (Discover).

---

## Phase Structure (frontmatter)

Phase and unit files carry a YAML frontmatter block that declares how the phase is
composed — its inputs, the fragments it runs, the assembler that combines them,
what it produces, its gates, and what it requires/advances-to. The DSL interpreter
contract is the vendored `references/vendored/dsl/INTERPRETER.md`: it defines every
frontmatter key, the fragment/assembler model, and the interpreter loop. **Load it
first** (once, at the start of a migration), then execute a phase file's prose
body. Elsewhere in this skill, `INTERPRETER.md` (without a path) refers to this
same loaded contract.

Frontmatter is being introduced phase-by-phase; a phase file without it runs from
its prose as before.

---

## Context Loading Rules

Each phase loads reference files on demand. To keep per-turn context manageable and prevent instruction-following degradation:

- **Budget:** Each phase should load no more than ~800 lines of instructions (excluding user artifacts like JSON profiles and MCP tool results).
- **Conditional loading:** Reference files with trigger conditions MUST NOT be loaded unless the condition is met. Do not speculatively load files.
- **No duplication:** Mapping tables, pricing data, and shared warnings exist in one canonical file. Other files reference them; they do not copy them inline.
- **Progressive depth:** Phase orchestrators (`design.md`, `generate.md`) contain short routing logic that points to detailed sub-files. Load the sub-file only when its path is selected.

Each phase declares its own conditional reference/knowledge loads in frontmatter (a fragment `_trigger` or a `_knowledge` entry's `_when`); do not maintain a separate load-condition table here.

When adding new reference files, verify the phase's total loaded instructions remain under budget. If a new file would exceed ~800 lines when combined with other loaded refs, split it or make it conditional.

---

## Execution

This skill is driven by the interpreter loop in `INTERPRETER.md` (§ The interpreter
loop): it reads `.phase-status.json`, determines the current phase, runs each
phase's `_preconditions` / fragments / `_assemble` / `_postconditions`, advances on
`HANDOFF_OK` via `_advances_to`, and validates state. The phase set, ordering, and
gates are all derived from the phase files' frontmatter and `INTERPRETER.md` — they
are not restated here.

**Cold start (entry phase).** On a cold start — no `.migration/` run with a
`.phase-status.json` yet — begin at `references/phases/discover/discover.md`, this
skill's entry phase (the one carrying `_init: true`). The interpreter loads THIS
phase directly; it does not scan every phase's frontmatter to discover the root.
All subsequent phases are reached by following each phase's `_advances_to`. On a
warm start, `current_phase` in `.phase-status.json` is authoritative **except**
when deferred-advance sidebar resume applies (`INTERPRETER.md` § The
interpreter loop step 2 — Estimate completed + `workshop` pending/in_progress
must not re-run Estimate).

**Clarify is mandatory (heroku policy).** Do not skip Clarify or jump straight to
Design, Estimate, or Generate even if the user asks — there is no exception for
"quick" or "obvious" migrations. A `preferences.json` that was not produced by an
actual Clarify run does not count. If asked to skip, refuse briefly and run
Clarify.

---

## State Management

Migration state lives in `$MIGRATION_DIR` (`.migration/[MMDD-HHMM]/`), created on
the first phase and persisted across invocations. The state file is
`.phase-status.json`; its shape is defined by
`references/vendored/state/phase-status.schema.json`, and how it is created, validated, and
updated across the lifecycle is defined in `INTERPRETER.md` § The interpreter loop.
The `.migration/` directory is protected by a `.gitignore` created at init.

---

## MCP Servers

**awspricing** (for cost estimation):

- Provides `get_pricing`, `get_pricing_service_codes`, `get_pricing_service_attributes` tools
- Only needed during Estimate phase. Discover and Design do not require it.
- Primary pricing source: `references/vendored/pricing/aws-infra-pricing.json` (cached AWS infrastructure rates, ±5-10% for infrastructure). MCP is secondary — used only for services not found in the pricing file.

## Defaults

- **IaC output**: Terraform configurations, migration scripts, and documentation
- **Region**: `us-east-1` (unless user specifies otherwise)
- **Sizing**: Development tier (e.g., `db.t4g.micro` for databases, 0.5 CPU for Fargate)
- **Migration mode**: Adapts based on available inputs (live CLI discovery recommended, Terraform supported, Procfile/app.json supplementary, billing optional)
- **Cost currency**: USD
- **Timeline assumption**: 2-16 weeks depending on migration complexity — small (2-6 weeks), medium (6-12 weeks), large (12-18 weeks). Complexity tiers are classified per `references/vendored/estimate/complexity-tiers.json`.

## Feedback & Sharing Sidebars

The interpreter loop (`INTERPRETER.md` § The interpreter loop) drives phase
sequencing, gates, and state. This section defines only the heroku-specific
sidebar orchestration: WHERE the optional `workshop` and `feedback`
sidebars are offered (placement is orchestration prose, not part of the phase
contract). Both are `_kind: sidebar` — off-backbone, trigger-entered, never
`current_phase`.

> **Plan-share links are GATED OFF.** The share landing page
> (`https://aws.amazon.com/startups/migrate/connect`) is not yet live (404). Do
> NOT offer, generate, or present a share link at any sidebar. The share-link
> spec is preserved in `references/phases/feedback/feedback-collect.md` Step 3
> (itself gated) for when the page ships; restoring the share prompts here is the
> un-gating change.

- **After Discover**: No prompt. Proceed directly to Clarify.

- **After Estimate**: First offer the what-if workshop sidebar per
  `estimate-assemble.md` (Enter workshop / Proceed toward Generate). Outer
  Estimate keeps `current_phase: estimate` until workshop is resolved (entered
  then exited via `workshop-assemble.md`, or declined). If the user enters
  workshop, follow `references/phases/workshop/workshop.md`. Then, if
  `phases.feedback` is `"pending"`:

  ```
  Would you like to share quick feedback? (5 optional questions +
  anonymized usage data — never resource names, file paths, or
  account IDs)

  [A] Yes, share feedback
  [B] No thanks, continue to Generate
  ```

  - If user picks **A** → Load `references/phases/feedback/feedback.md`, execute it. Set `phases.feedback` to `"completed"`. Continue to Generate.
  - If user picks **B** → Set `phases.feedback` to `"completed"`. Continue to Generate.

- **Workshop resume (mandatory):** If `current_phase == "estimate"` AND
  `phases.estimate == "completed"` AND `phases.workshop` is `"pending"` or
  `"in_progress"`, **do not recompute Estimate**. If `"pending"`, re-present the
  post-Estimate workshop offer from `estimate-assemble.md`. If `"in_progress"`,
  load `references/phases/workshop/workshop.md`. Generate must wait until
  `phases.workshop == "completed"` (entered+exited or declined).

- **Warm start / explicit what-if**: If the user says "what if", "reprice",
  "workshop mode", or "compare scenarios" and Estimate artifacts already exist,
  load `references/phases/workshop/workshop.md` directly (respect Generate
  `_re_entry_guard` when Terraform was already produced). Knobs on the pilot
  sheet: region, HA, compute target, cost optimization, CPU architecture
  (x86 vs Graviton). There is no traffic-multiplier knob in v1.

- **After Generate**: No prompt. If `phases.feedback` is still `"pending"`, set it to `"completed"` and mark the migration complete.

**Critical constraint**: Follow each phase reference file's workflow exactly. If unable to complete a step, stop and report the specific issue. Do not fabricate or infer data.
