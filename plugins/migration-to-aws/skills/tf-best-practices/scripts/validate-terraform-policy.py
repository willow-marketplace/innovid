"""Static policy checks on generated Terraform (no provider init required).

Read-only VERDICT PRODUCER. This script never edits .tf files and never touches
run state (.phase-status.json). It parses HCL, evaluates policy, and emits a
structured verdict (stdout summary + optional --json report). Remediation and any
phase/state decisions belong to the CALLER (see tf-best-practices SKILL.md).

Enforces (each rule is fail-open on ambiguity — fires only on unambiguous,
in-block literal evidence, so a valid stack is never falsely blocked):
  - Internet-facing ALB TLS posture:
      * HTTPS listener on port 443 with certificate_arn and a forward action
      * HTTP listener on port 80 must redirect to HTTPS (never forward to targets)
  - rds_not_public: aws_db_instance / aws_rds_cluster must not set
    publicly_accessible = true (fail-open when variable-driven or absent).
  - db_sg_no_public_ingress: an inline aws_security_group ingress covering a
    database port (5432 / 3306) must not allow 0.0.0.0/0 (IPv4) or ::/0 (IPv6)
    (fail-open on separate aws_security_group_rule /
    aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule resources, which this static reader
    cannot correlate).
  - sg_no_public_admin_ingress: an inline ingress must not open a well-known
    admin/datastore port (SSH, RDP, Redis, Memcached, Mongo, Elasticsearch,
    Kibana) to 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0. Scoped to a fixed never-public port list — web
    ports and app/game ports are not flagged. Same inline-only fail-open scope.
    Both SG rules read cidr_blocks and ipv6_cidr_blocks independently: an
    IPv6-only or dual-stack VPC is exposed by ::/0 exactly as IPv4 is by
    0.0.0.0/0.
  - no_wildcard_iam: a literal IAM policy document with Effect "Allow" must not
    use Action "*" or Resource "*" (fail-open on aws_iam_policy_document data
    sources, whose statements are not visible as literal JSON here).
  - rds_encryption_at_rest: aws_db_instance / aws_rds_cluster must set
    storage_encrypted = true (RDS defaults to UNENCRYPTED). Fail-open when
    variable-driven. S3 is intentionally NOT checked: buckets have default
    SSE-S3 since Jan 2023, so a missing SSE block is not an unencrypted bucket.
  - elasticache_encryption_at_rest: aws_elasticache_replication_group must set
    at_rest_encryption_enabled = true. Fail-open when variable-driven.

    would let unrelated text shift the apparent nesting of a real attribute.

    included, terminating newline excluded), distinguishing them from the other
    non-code states — a reader that must ignore comments but still read string
    contents (list entries are quoted strings) needs that distinction.

    Interpolations are treated as opaque string content: `{` and `}` inside a

    requires tracking interpolation nesting, because `${...}` may contain its own
