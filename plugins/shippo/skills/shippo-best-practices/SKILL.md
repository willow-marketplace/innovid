Latest Shippo API version: **2018-02-08**. Send via the `Shippo-API-Version` header.

## Using the Shippo MCP

The hosted Shippo MCP at `https://mcp.shippo.com` exposes exactly **4 tools** (a meta-API), not the underlying operations directly:

- `shippo_list_tools`: discover which operation you need.
- `shippo_describe_tool`: get that operation's input schema.
- `shippo_read_execute_tool`: run a read (lists, gets, lookups).
- `shippo_write_execute_tool`: run a write or mutation (creates, purchases, voids).

Every operation name in this skill (`ValidateAddress`, `CreateShipment`, `CreateTransaction`, `GetTrack`, etc.) is invoked **through** these wrappers, never called as a tool on its own. Standard discovery pattern: `shippo_list_tools` to find the operation, then `shippo_describe_tool` for its schema, then `shippo_read_execute_tool` or `shippo_write_execute_tool` to run it. The read/write split lets approval policies gate mutations separately. In the Claude apps these 4 tools may be deferred (loaded on demand), so an initial "tool has not been loaded yet" is normal: discover via the wrappers rather than guessing operation names.

## Critical rules

- **Always validate addresses before purchasing labels.** Most "no rates" / "label failed" errors trace back to unvalidated addresses.
- **Label purchases charge your live Shippo account for real.** Always confirm carrier, service, and cost with the user before any purchase.
- **Always confirm purchase before `CreateTransaction`.** Show carrier/service/cost/eta and require explicit user confirmation.
- **Parcel dimensions and weight must be strings, not numbers.** Use `"10"`, never `10`.
- **Label URLs are S3 signed URLs.** Always display the complete URL, truncating breaks the signature.
- **Rates expire after 7 days.** Re-create the shipment for fresh rates.
- **By-id parameter names are case-sensitive** (mostly PascalCase: `ShipmentId`, `TransactionId`, `OrderId`). Use the exact name from `shippo_describe_tool`; do not guess snake_case.
- **Never retry a 403/404 tool error with the same arguments.** Ownership and not-found errors are permanent for those inputs; verify the ID via the matching `List*` operation first. The generic `An internal error occurred. Please retry later.` relay most often traces to an input issue too, so verify inputs before retrying, and retry the identical call at most once.

## Response handling

The MCP wraps responses in a Speakeasy envelope. Some failures bypass the envelope. See `shippo/references/response-envelope.md` and `shippo/references/error-reference.md` for parsing logic and error-handling patterns.

## Connecting

The hosted MCP at `https://mcp.shippo.com` uses per-user Shippo OAuth. You authorize once through Shippo (in Claude Code, run `/mcp` and sign in), and the session refreshes automatically. There is nothing to copy or configure. Once you are connected, the workflow guidance below is unchanged.

- **Two 401 strings to recognize:**
  - `"Token does not exist"`: the credential is invalid, revoked, or for a different account. Re-authorize the Shippo OAuth session.
  - `"Authentication credentials were not provided"`: no credential reached Shippo. The OAuth session is not authorized yet, or it has expired. Re-authorize the Shippo OAuth session.

## Purchases are live

Label and batch purchases charge the authorized Shippo account for real money. Before any `CreateTransaction` or `PurchaseBatch`, show the carrier, service level, cost, and ETA, and get explicit user confirmation. Do not proceed without it.
