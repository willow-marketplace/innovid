# Package Tracking

## Track by Number

1. Determine carrier and tracking number. Carrier must be a lowercase Shippo token (e.g., `usps`, `ups`, `fedex`, `dhl_express`). See `shippo/references/carrier-guide.md` for tracking number format hints per carrier. If uncertain, ask the user.
2. Call `GetTrack` with `carrier` and `tracking_number`.
3. Key response fields: `tracking_status` (status, status_details, status_date, location), `tracking_history`, `eta`.
4. Each tracking event includes a `substatus` object with `code`, `text`, and `action_required` (boolean). Include substatus details when presenting tracking history -- these provide more specific information about what happened at each step.
5. Present: current status, location, ETA, substatus details, and chronological event history (most recent first).

## Status Values

See `shippo/references/carrier-guide.md` for carrier-specific status nuances. Standard values:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| PRE_TRANSIT | Label created, carrier has not received the package |
| TRANSIT | Package is in transit |
| DELIVERED | Delivered |
| RETURNED | Being returned or returned to sender |
| FAILURE | Delivery failed |
| UNKNOWN | No tracking information from carrier |

The `eta` field is provided by most major carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL Express) but availability is carrier-dependent, it may be `null` for regional carriers or for shipments before the carrier has finalized routing. Treat absence as informational, not as an error condition.

## Find Trackable Packages

Call `ListTransactions`. Filter for `object_status: SUCCESS`. Each successful transaction has `tracking_number` and carrier info. Then call `GetTrack` for selected items.

---

## Register a Tracking Webhook

1. Get the user's HTTPS webhook URL.
2. Call `createWebhook` with `url` and `event: track_updated`.
3. Optionally call `CreateTrack` with carrier and tracking number to register a specific shipment for push updates.

## Quick Reference

**Track a package:**
`GetTrack` with carrier + tracking number
