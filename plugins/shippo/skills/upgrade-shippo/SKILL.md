The Shippo MCP is hosted at `https://mcp.shippo.com`. It is OAuth-only and auto-updates server-side, so there is nothing to install or upgrade on your side. This skill covers what stays your responsibility: API version awareness, webhook payload versioning, and troubleshooting the hosted session.

## API version handling

The current Shippo API version is **2018-02-08**. Shippo uses a single long-lived API version, and the hosted server manages it for you server-side. You do not set the `Shippo-API-Version` header yourself when going through the hosted MCP.

What backward-compatibility means in practice:

- Most changes are backward-compatible: new optional fields, new resources, additional webhook events. Existing calls keep working.
- Breaking changes are rare and announced via release notes.
- Because the server picks the version, you don't pin anything client-side. Your job is to handle new fields gracefully (see webhook versioning below) rather than to manage versions.

Shippo API changes are tracked in [the API changelog](https://docs.goshippo.com/changelog). As of 2026-06, no recent breaking changes affect the workflows covered by this skill set.

## Webhook event versioning

Webhook events can include new fields without bumping the API version. To handle them gracefully:

- Default to ignoring unknown fields in your webhook handler, never fail-closed on a field you don't recognize.
- Subscribe only to the specific event types you need (`track_updated`, `transaction_created`, `transaction_updated`, etc.).
- Verify webhook signatures using the `Shippo-Signature` header per [webhook docs](https://docs.goshippo.com/docs/tracking/webhooks).

## Troubleshooting the hosted MCP

### `401` or `403` errors

The OAuth session has expired or is not authorized. Re-authorize the Shippo OAuth session: in Claude Code, run `/mcp` and sign in again.

### Tools changed or missing after a server update

The hosted server auto-updates, so the tool catalog can shift without any action on your side. Re-list the current tools via `shippo_list_tools` to see what is available now.

### "Not found" errors for objects you expect to exist

Most likely the object does not exist on the authorized account, or it belongs to a different account. Confirm you are signed in to the account that owns the object (re-authorize via `/mcp` if needed).

## Auditing an existing integration

Before making a change to a production integration:

1. Don't pin anything client-side. The hosted server manages the API version, so there's nothing to pin.
2. Verify webhook handlers ignore unknown fields.
3. Review the [API changelog](https://docs.goshippo.com/changelog) for any breaking changes.
4. Re-list tools via `shippo_list_tools` after an update to catch renamed or added operations.
