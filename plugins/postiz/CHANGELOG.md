# Changelog

All notable changes to the Postiz CLI will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.18] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- Gemini CLI extension: a root `gemini-extension.json` so the repo installs with `gemini extensions install https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-agent`. It exposes the `postiz` skill from `skills/postiz` and declares the hosted Postiz MCP server (`https://mcp.postiz.com/mcp-oauth-dynamic`, OAuth on first connect via Gemini CLI's automatic OAuth discovery). The repo carries the `gemini-cli-extension` topic, so the [Gemini CLI extensions gallery](https://geminicli.com/extensions/browse/) indexes it from the latest tag.
- DeepSeek Harness plugin: `plugins/dsh-postiz` is an installable `dsh` bundle (`dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-postiz`). It mounts one `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` row pointed at the hosted Postiz MCP server (`https://mcp.postiz.com/mcp`, Bearer auth from `POSTIZ_API_KEY`) and registers a `postiz` skill describing the integrationList → integrationSchema → schedulePostTool workflow. Self-hosted instances override `baseUrl` on the `postiz` row. Listed on [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin); the repo now carries the `dsh-plugin` topic.

## [2.0.17] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Grok Build plugin support: `.grok-plugin/plugin.json` and `.grok-plugin/marketplace.json` (validated with xAI's `validate-catalog.py`). The Grok manifest also declares the hosted Postiz MCP server (`https://mcp.postiz.com/mcp-oauth-dynamic`, OAuth on first connect) via its `mcpServers` field. The Claude Code and Cursor plugins stay skill/CLI-only — there is intentionally no root `.mcp.json`, so installing those plugins never registers a second Postiz MCP server next to an existing connector.

## [2.0.16] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Cursor plugin support: `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` and `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` so the repo installs as a [Cursor plugin](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/plugins) alongside the existing Claude Code plugin. `skills/postiz/SKILL.md` is now a real file instead of a symlink, regenerated from the root `SKILL.md` by a GitHub Action on every published release (or `pnpm sync-skill` locally).
- `posts:settings` - Update a post's provider settings via `PUT /public/v1/posts/:id/settings` (merged — only the keys you pass change; unpublished DRAFT/QUEUE posts only).

### Changed
- `posts:list` responses now include each post's current `settings`.
