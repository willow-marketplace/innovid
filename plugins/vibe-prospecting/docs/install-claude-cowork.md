# Connect Vibe Prospecting in Claude Cowork

Vibe Prospecting runs in Cowork through its MCP connector. Cowork cannot run the vpai CLI, so connect it from the connector store—no GitHub clone, packaging, or command line is required.

## Connector setup

Before doing any work, check whether Vibe Prospecting MCP connector tools are in your tool list (look for `mcp__*__fetch-entities`).

If those tools are present, use them directly.

If those tools are not present, ask Claude to search the connector store for **Vibe Prospecting** or **Explorium**, then suggest the official Vibe Prospecting connector:

- If the connector is already installed but disabled for this session, select **Use** on the connector card.
- Otherwise, select **Connect** on the connector card to install and authorize it.

Re-check the tool list until `mcp__*__fetch-entities` appears. Do not start prospecting until the tools appear.

If the suggested card fails, open the **connector / integrations UI** directly, connect Vibe Prospecting there, and re-check the tool list.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| No `mcp__*__fetch-entities` in tool list | Search the connector store for Vibe Prospecting, suggest it, then re-check tools |
| User asks to use CLI or `npx vpai` | Cowork cannot run the CLI; connector store is the only path |
| Connector connect fails | Open connector store, connect Vibe Prospecting again, then re-check tools |
| Auth / 401 on connector tools | Reconnect Vibe Prospecting from the connector or integrations UI |
