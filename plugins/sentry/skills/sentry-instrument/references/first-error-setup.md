# First-error setup (one real error, end to end)

The shared spine for getting a brand-new project reporting to Sentry — detect the platform,
provision a project, install the SDK with sane defaults, and confirm a real error lands. Any flow
that starts from zero runs this; it exists so the sequence lives in exactly one place.

This file owns the **order**, not the details. Each step hands off to the reference that owns it —
follow that reference, then come back. Don't re-derive what those files already cover.

## Step 1 — Detect the platform

Read [`sdks/index.md`](sdks/index.md) for the catalog and detection rules. Identify the platform from
project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `Gemfile`, `*.csproj`, `build.gradle`,
`pubspec.yaml`, …), **tell the user what you found and confirm** — don't assume from files alone —
then open that platform's `sdks/<slug>/index.md`,
`sdks/<slug>/error-monitoring.md`, and `sdks/<slug>/tracing.md`.

## Step 2 — Provision a project + DSN

Follow [`new-project.md`](new-project.md). Determine via the MCP whether a fitting project already
exists; select it and read its DSN, or create one (propose `create_project` and create on a yes,
never silently). Either way you come back with the DSN to use in `init`.

## Step 3 — Install the SDK with sane defaults

Following the platform references, install the SDK and write `init` using the DSN from Step 2. Take
the SDK reference's **recommended default setup** as written — in practice errors and tracing. Don't
ask the user which signals to enable, and don't pare it back to errors-only; the reference's default
`init` is the best-practice baseline for a new project.

## Step 4 — Verify end to end

Close the loop with [`setup-verification.md`](setup-verification.md): run the **real** application,
make it throw a genuine error through its actual init/code path (a temporary real trigger in the app
is fine — never a standalone script that bypasses init), poll the MCP until the error appears, and
**show the user what came back from the MCP — the issue title, the error message/value, and the
direct issue URL — not just the link**, then confirm it's verified end to end. Not done until the
real error is seen in Sentry.

## Step 5 — Get it into production — this is the point

A verified local error just proves the wiring works; the value is capturing errors from *real users*.
Don't end on "it works locally." **Work with the user to get it into production — advocate for it
plainly, but don't take deploy actions without their consent:**

- **If you already have context on how this project deploys** — a CI/CD config, a deploy script, a
  Dockerfile/Procfile, a hosting platform (Vercel, Fly, Render, Heroku, …), or a deploy section in
  `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` — use it. Walk the user through (or offer to make) the changes to ship the
  Sentry-instrumented build, making sure the DSN and the `release`/`environment` values are set in
  the production environment, not just locally.
- **Otherwise**, advocate plainly and ask: getting Sentry into production is the most important next
  step because real user errors are where the payoff is — how do you deploy this, and can I help wire
  it in?

## Step 6 — Make sure production stack traces will be readable

Local frames often look fine while production builds mangle them — minified JavaScript, stripped
native symbols — so an issue from a real user can be unreadable even though the verified test error
wasn't. This is per-platform: the platform's `sdks/<slug>/index.md` ("Platform
considerations") names what *this* stack needs — e.g. **source maps** for JavaScript/TypeScript,
**debug symbols** (dSYM, ProGuard/R8) for native/mobile. Frame it proactively, tied to the platform
you detected:

> "Now that this is heading to production — since you're on <platform>, we'll want
> <source maps / debug symbols / …> so real-user stack traces stay readable. Here's what that takes."

Also **scrutinize the verified issue**: pull it with `get_issue_details` and check the frames show
actual source (file, line, function), not minified or unsymbolicated noise. Degraded frames even
locally are a strong signal production will be worse.

## What "done" looks like

The SDK is installed with sane defaults (errors + tracing), a **real error produced by the running
app** has been confirmed in Sentry via the MCP (its title, error message, and issue URL surfaced to
the user), **the user has been worked toward getting it into production** (with their consent — no
deploy without it), and **production stack-trace quality has been addressed** (the per-platform
source maps / debug symbols flagged, and the produced issue's frames scrutinized). A local-only
setup isn't the finish line.
