# Releases — What & Why

A **release** is a version of your code deployed to an environment.
Tying every event to its exact version unlocks:

- **Regression detection** — when an issue first appeared and whether it came back in a
  later release.
- **Crash-free rates / release health** — error-free sessions and users per release
  (session tracking is on by default in most modern SDKs).
- **Suspect commits** — the specific commit(s) likely responsible for an issue, surfaced
  on the issue with a suggested assignee.
- **Resolve-in-next-release** and **`Fixes SENTRY-XXX`** — resolve an issue and let
  Sentry track whether it stays fixed in the version that ships the fix.

## While debugging

Releases let you pin the exact code that was running when an issue was produced — diff
against that revision rather than assuming `main` matches — and **suspect commits** on
the issue are the fastest “what changed.”
Suspect commits need the source-control integration below; without it you still get
release-scoped regression and health, just not the culprit commit.

## Setup essentials — two ingredients

1. **The `release` (and `environment`) tag on events** — set in the SDK `init` (or
   `SENTRY_RELEASE`). Without it every event is “unknown release” and regression/health
   features can’t work.
2. **The release object + commits + deploy, created in CI** — via `sentry-cli` or the
   GitHub Action. **Associating commits is what powers suspect commits**, and that
   association needs a **source-control integration** (GitHub/GitLab) connected in
   Sentry’s UI (an OAuth step the agent can’t do).
   The **release name must match** between the SDK tag and the CI-created release, or
   events won’t attribute.

Use a meaningful, unique version (a commit SHA or semver), set `environment` so staging
noise doesn’t pollute prod health, and finalize the release + record the deploy at
deploy time.
