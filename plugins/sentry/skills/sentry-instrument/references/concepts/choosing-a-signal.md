# Choosing a signal

Sentry captures several distinct **signals**. They are not interchangeable. Picking the right one is
the single most important instrumentation decision, and the wrong one is the most common waste of
quota. Decide by the question you are trying to answer.

| You want to know… | Reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| *Something broke — what, where, and why?* | **Error** | An exception/crash with a stack trace, grouped into an issue. The default, always-on signal. |
| *Why is this slow? What's the chain of calls? Did the request flow through the system as expected?* | **Span / trace** | Timing and structure of a request across services (distributed tracing). Powers performance-issue detection (N+1, slow DB). |
| *What happened leading up to this?* | **Log** | A searchable, structured, trace-connected record of discrete events. Narrative context, not timing. |
| *How many / how much / what's the trend over time?* | **Metric** | An aggregate number (counter / gauge / distribution) for a KPI you watch and alert on. |
| *Which exact function/line is burning CPU?* | **Profile** | Code-level sampling under a traced transaction. Requires tracing on. |
| *What did the user actually see and do?* | **Session Replay** | A video-like reproduction of a frontend/mobile session around an error or UX problem. |
| *What does the user think went wrong?* | **User Feedback** | A qualitative report from a human, linked to the surrounding context. |
| *Did my scheduled job run on time?* | **Cron monitor** | Check-ins that detect missed, late, or failed recurring jobs. |

Most of these signals carry the same **trace ID**, so once one surfaces a problem you can pivot to the
others in the same request — the trace is the connective tissue that ties errors, spans, logs, replays,
and metrics together for debugging.

## Comparisons

- **Error vs. log.** An exception your code can't handle is an **error** (capture it as one — it
  groups into an issue and gets a stack trace). A noteworthy thing that happened but isn't a failure
  is a **log**. Don't log-spam things that should be errors; don't capture routine events as errors
  and pollute the issue stream.
- **Log vs. span.** A log answers *what happened*; a span answers *how long it took and what it
  called*. If you find yourself logging start/end timestamps to measure duration, you want a span
  instead.
- **Span vs. metric.** A span is one sampled instance of an operation (great for "show me a slow
  request"). An **Application Metric** is a numeric measurement aggregated over all occurrences at query
  time (great for "alert when p95 latency exceeds 500ms") and, unlike a traditional metric, can carry
  high-cardinality attributes.
- **Metric vs. counting events.** Don't emit a custom metric for something Sentry already derives
  from errors/spans (issue counts, throughput, latency percentiles, crash-free rate). Reserve custom
  metrics for **business/operational KPIs** Sentry can't see — `checkout.failed`, `queue.depth`,
  `cache.hit_ratio`.
- **Profile rides on tracing.** Profiling is not a standalone signal — it samples *inside* traced
  transactions. Tracing must be on first.

## What to instrument where

- **Errors:** everywhere, always. This is the baseline and the first thing to get working.
- **Tracing:** the request **boundaries** first — incoming HTTP, outbound HTTP, DB / cache / queue.
  Auto-instrumentation covers most of these once tracing is on. Add custom spans only for meaningful
  business operations.
- **Logging:** a few high-signal events per request with structured attributes — not a firehose.
- **Metrics:** a small, deliberate set of KPIs that map to a real decision or alert.
- **Replay:** frontend (and mobile) only; high sampling on errors, low on normal sessions.
- **Crons:** every scheduled job whose silent failure would hurt.

When the user is unsure, ask what question they're trying to answer and map it with the table above.
When they say "set it up properly" / "you pick the defaults," lean on the recommended baseline:
**errors + tracing at a modest sample rate + releases + source maps**, then add logs/replay/profiling
as the use case warrants.

## Cross-cutting concepts (not signals)

These shape how the signals above behave and how you act on them — each has its own reference:

- **Releases** — tie every event to a deployed version. Unlocks regression detection, crash-free
  rates, suspect commits, and resolve-in-next-release.
- **Monitors → Issues → Alerts** — Sentry's detection-and-response model. *Monitors* decide when a
  signal becomes an **issue**; *Alerts* act on issues.
- **Data scrubbing / PII** — what's sensitive, and the defense-in-depth model for keeping it out.
- **Volume & cost** — what to keep vs. drop, and where to sample.
- **Search query language** — the `key:value` grammar shared by every query surface.
