# Cron / Scheduled-Job Monitoring — What & Why

Monitoring for recurring jobs — cron jobs, scheduled tasks, queue workers. Sentry watches for runs that
are **missed**, **late**, **timed out**, or **failed** and turns those into issues. It works via
**check-ins**: the job reports `in_progress` when it starts and `ok`/`error` when it finishes; a run that
never checks in (or checks in late) is flagged against the monitor's schedule.

Reach for it where **silent failure is dangerous** — a nightly billing run, a data sync, a backup — and
"it didn't run" is as bad as "it crashed."

## Why a cron issue often isn't where you'd look

- **A "missed" issue frequently isn't in the job code.** Missed means no check-in arrived in the expected
  window — commonly the **scheduler** (misconfigured, skipped, never started the job), a **network**
  problem (outbound firewall, flaky connection), or a timeout. Don't assume the job body threw.
- **The real exception is a separate error event on the same trace.** If the SDK is configured, errors
  thrown during the run are captured as normal error events and tied back to the check-in through the
  run's trace — follow the trace from the cron issue to find them.
- **Issue creation is threshold-gated,** not per-failure: `failure_issue_threshold` (N consecutive
  failures before an issue opens) and `recovery_threshold` (N consecutive OKs before it resolves). A
  single failure may not create an issue.
- **Absence of alerts ≠ healthy.** A monitor broken for weeks gets auto-muted — it stops producing issues
  and notifications while billing continues. A silent monitor may be muted, not passing.

## Setup essentials

- **Monitor config is data** (server-side): the schedule (crontab — 5-field only — or interval), the
  **`timezone`**, **`checkin_margin`** (how late counts as missed), and **`max_runtime`** (how long counts
  as hung). Set the last two to the job's real timing — tight enough to catch a hang, loose enough to
  avoid false alarms.
- **Check-ins are code** (SDK-side). Paths: the SDK **`withMonitor` / decorator** wrapper (cleanest when
  an SDK is present — sends both start and outcome), an **HTTP check-in** (any language, ideal for shell
  crontabs), or **`sentry-cli`** wrapping a shell command. Wrap the **whole job** so both success and
  failure report; a bare heartbeat (single `ok`/`error`) detects *missed* but not *`max_runtime`*
  timeouts.
- **Use a stable, descriptive slug** (`nightly-invoice-sync`, not `job-1`) — it's the check-in key, so
  slug churn on every deploy orphans monitors.
