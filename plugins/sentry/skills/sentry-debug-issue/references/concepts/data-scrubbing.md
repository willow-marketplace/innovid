# Data Scrubbing / PII — Strategy

Controlling what personal or sensitive data reaches (and is stored by) Sentry — a common
GDPR / PCI / SOC2 requirement, or just not wanting tokens in your error tracker.
Treat as sensitive: emails, names, IPs, user IDs that map to people, full
request/response **bodies**, **headers** (auth tokens, cookies, session IDs), query
strings with tokens, passwords, and anything regulated.
When in doubt, assume a field is sensitive.

## Defense in depth — two layers, both

1. **SDK-side (before data leaves the app)** — the strongest guarantee; data you never
   send can’t leak.
   - `sendDefaultPii` controls whether the SDK attaches request/user PII automatically
     (default off).
   - `beforeSend` / `beforeSendTransaction` hooks strip, redact, or drop fields on every
     event.
2. **Server-side (Sentry, the backstop)** — data-scrubbing rules scrub on ingest
   (Safe/Sensitive field lists + an advanced selector rules engine).
   On by default.

Scrub at the earliest layer you can; keep the server-side rules as a backstop, because
you’ll eventually capture something you didn’t anticipate.

## AI/LLM attributes (`gen_ai.*`)

**Prompt and completion attributes (`gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`,
`gen_ai.tool.call.*`, …) are not scrubbed by the default server-side rules.** Their
capture is itself opt-in (only when PII capture is enabled), but *once captured they
aren’t redacted* — so if you instrument an LLM app, explicitly scrub them with an
advanced rule (`$span.data.'<attribute>'`) or disable their capture.

## Verify, don’t assume

Trigger an event and confirm the sensitive fields are absent/redacted in the event
detail. Logs and replay/screenshots are the easiest leaks — pair with
[`logging.md`](logging.md) and [`session-replay.md`](session-replay.md).
