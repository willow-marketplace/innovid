# Cloudflare Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) for building on Cloudflare, Workers, the Agents SDK, and the wider Cloudflare Developer Platform.

## Installing

Use the native plugin where supported to install both Cloudflare guidance and the Cloudflare MCP server. Agents that only support the Agent Skills standard can install the skills separately.

### Codex

Install from the Cloudflare plugin marketplace:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add cloudflare/skills
codex plugin add cloudflare@cloudflare
```

Start a new Codex session after installation.

### Claude Code

Install using the [plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#add-from-github):

```
/plugin marketplace add cloudflare/skills
/plugin install cloudflare@cloudflare
```

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Install directly from this repository:

1. Enable `chat.plugins.enabled` in VS Code settings.
2. Open the Command Palette and run **Chat: Install Plugin From Source**.
3. Enter `https://github.com/cloudflare/skills`.

For marketplace installation or troubleshooting, see [VS Code's agent plugin documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-plugins).

### Cursor

Install from the Cursor Marketplace or add manually via **Settings > Rules > Add Rule > Remote Rule (Github)** with `cloudflare/skills`.

### npx skills

Install using the [`npx skills`](https://skills.sh) CLI:

```
npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills
```

### Clone / Copy

Clone this repo and copy the skill folders into the appropriate directory for your agent:

| Agent | Skill Directory | Docs |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` | [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` | [docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills) |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | [docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills/) |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` | [docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) |

## Skills

Skills are contextual and auto-loaded based on your conversation. When a request matches a skill's triggers, the agent loads and applies the relevant skill to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.

| Skill | Useful for |

## MCP Servers

This plugin includes Cloudflare's main [remote MCP server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/) for enhanced functionality:

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| cloudflare | Access the Cloudflare API and current developer documentation through the Code Mode MCP server |

Cloudflare also publishes product-specific MCP servers. This plugin intentionally bundles only the main `cloudflare` server.
