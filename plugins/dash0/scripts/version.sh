# on their next `plugin install`.
# This is the only list of them, so the bump and the check cannot disagree about
# what needs bumping. Used by .github/workflows/release.yml, CI's
# consistency-checks job, and `make version-check`.

# Test hooks, used by test/contracts/release.sh:

#   PINNED             the manifest version, instead of reading plugin.json
