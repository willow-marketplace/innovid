# Assert that a published release carries a binary for every platform each
# bootstrap can ask for, at the exact public URL the bootstrap builds.
#
# Asset names are read out of the scripts, not hardcoded: hardcoding them once
# let a rename through, where the bootstrap asked for claude-on-event-<os>-<arch>
# while this probed on-event-<os>-<arch> and passed. A script may list several
# candidates and try them in order, so the requirement is that at least ONE
# resolves per platform.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-release-assets.sh <version>            # missing release => warn
#   scripts/verify-release-assets.sh --strict <version>   # missing release => fail
#
# Non-strict is for CI on a bump PR, where the tag comes only after the merge.
# Strict is for the release workflow, where a missing release IS the failure.

# 403 is retried alongside 429 and 5xx: it is what github.com answers for
# anonymous rate limiting, and this script makes about thirty unauthenticated
# requests per run. Treating it as unclassifiable would hard-fail the strict
# check after the release is already public.
#
# Retries live here, in the one place every request goes through, so the
# checksums gate below gets them too. It used to be the only unretried request
# in the strict path — and it is the first one, so a single 429 killed the run
# reporting "release has no checksums.txt", which is a lie about a published
# release.
#
# Bounded by one deadline for the whole script rather than per request. Thirty
# probes each willing to sleep independently is minutes of unbounded wait, and
# the job calling this has a 20-minute timeout it would blow through — after
# Publish, which is the worst place to be killed.
