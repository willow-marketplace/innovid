"""Read token usage out of a Codex rollout file, independently of the plugin.

This is the Codex runtime's second observation channel, and it stands where
claude-code-usage-audit.py stands for Claude Code. A rollout is Codex's own
record of a session, written by Codex, so a number computed from it owes nothing
to the plugin that also read it.

Independence has one rule and this file keeps it: nothing here imports or shells
out to internal/source/codex. The format is re-read from the file, so the two
readers can disagree — which is the entire point of having two.

What a rollout holds, as of codex-cli 0.149.1:

  session_meta   one, first: session_id, cli_version, cwd, originator
  turn_context   the model and settings a turn ran under
  response_item  the conversation, including function_call items (tool calls)
  event_msg      Codex's own events; token_count carries info.last_token_usage
  world_state    a workspace snapshot, ignored here

Token usage is a running series, one token_count per model round-trip, not a
total. Two figures therefore come out of one file, and they differ as soon as a
session has more than one turn:

  file    every token_count summed — the whole session
  turn    the counts since the last turn boundary — the last turn only

The plugin puts the TURN figure on each chat span, so a single-turn session is
the case where both agree and neither can hide a bug in the other. Prefer one
for a first run.

> The turn boundary is `event_msg` / `user_message`, which is what
> internal/source/codex/rollout.go resets on. Codex 0.149.1 was observed writing
> `task_started` instead on an exec session, so a rollout with no `user_message`
> at all reports `turn_boundaries: 0` here and its `turn` figure equals its
> `file` figure. That is reported, never silently substituted: if a multi-turn
> session shows zero boundaries, the product's per-turn scoping is the thing to
> go and look at.

Usage:
  qa/tools/qa-rollout.py qa/runs/<run-id>/rollout.jsonl
  qa/tools/qa-rollout.py qa/runs/<run-id>/rollout.jsonl --json

Exit codes:
  0  the file was read
  2  it could not be read, or it is compressed and therefore unreadable here
