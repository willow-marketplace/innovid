"""Compare the spans Dash0 stored against three records the plugin never wrote.

Reads one run directory from qa/tools/qa-session.sh or qa-session-codex.sh and
lines up four columns. Two of them are the same in both runtimes:

  dash0       spans read back with `dash0 spans query`, filtered to this session
  hooks       what the plugin was fed: record/index.jsonl and the event payloads

The other two are whatever the runtime's own records are. `manifest.json` names
the runtime and this tool follows it:

  claude      transcript  claude-code-usage-audit.py over the session transcript
              harness     the usage block in `claude -p --output-format json`
  codex       transcript  qa-rollout.py over the Codex rollout: usage only, no
                          span counts, so those cells read `-` rather than 0
              harness     what `codex exec --json` reported, plus the plugin's
                          own debug log, which only the Codex runtime has
  copilot     transcript  qa-otel.py over Copilot's native-OTel file
              harness     what `copilot --output-format json` reported, plus the
                          plugin's debug log
  cursor      transcript  qa-transcript-cursor.py over Cursor's agent transcript:
                          turns and tool calls, and no usage — no token count
                          appears in it, so those cells read `-`
              harness     nothing but the plugin's debug log. The TUI has no
                          machine-readable output, and print mode, which has one,
                          fires no afterAgentResponse and so produces no turn

The Copilot runtime inverts one thing, and reading its table without knowing
that is how a healthy run gets filed as a bug. Its hooks carry no numbers and no
tool events the plugin consumes: a Copilot tool span is built from the
native-OTel file, not from a hook, and so is the invoke_agent span of every
sub-agent it spawns. So the `hooks` column expects a chat span and nothing else,
its other cells read `-`, and the tool and agent comparisons run against the
OTel channel instead. That channel is the plugin's own input as well
as an observation, so an agreement there is weaker than the one the other two
runtimes get — it proves a faithful copy, not a correct measurement.

Only `dash0` and `harness` are the product's output. `hooks` is the pipeline's
own input, so a span missing there is a span the plugin was never asked to make;
a span present in `hooks` and absent from `dash0` is the plugin's or the
transport's fault. That distinction is the point of recording the input at all.

Reads qa/config.local.json for the API endpoint, token, and dataset. It does
not use the dash0 CLI's active profile: that profile carries its own dataset,
and reading the wrong one returns an empty result that looks exactly like the
plugin having sent nothing.
