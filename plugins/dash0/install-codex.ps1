.SYNOPSIS
Dash0 - OpenAI Codex telemetry installer for Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
The Windows counterpart of install-codex.sh, section for section, so the two can
be compared side by side.

Windows PowerShell 5.1 is the target, because that is the version every Windows
install has: no ternary, no null-coalescing, no Join-Path with several child
paths. Everything it needs ships with Windows - curl.exe for downloads and
System.Security.Cryptography for checksums.

.EXAMPLE
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dash0hq/dash0-agent-plugin/main/install-codex.ps1 | iex

.EXAMPLE
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-codex.ps1 `
  -Endpoint https://ingress.us1.aws.dash0.com -Token dash0_... -Dataset default

.NOTES
Every flag is optional. A flag that is not supplied is prompted for, or left
blank in a non-interactive run - the plugin then installs but stays inactive
until the config file is filled in.

Env vars: DASH0_OTLP_URL, DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN, DASH0_DATASET, DASH0_TEAM_NAME,
DASH0_VERSION (pins a specific release), DASH0_RAW_REF (pins the git ref the
plugin files come from; for testing before a release),
DASH0_SKIP_PLUGIN_FILES=1 (leave the plugin files on disk alone; for testing a
locally staged build).

What this installs:
  %USERPROFILE%\.local\state\dash0-agent-plugin\codex\codex-on-event.ps1
      Bootstrap Codex invokes on each hook event.
  ...\codex\bin\codex-on-event-<v>-windows-<arch>.exe
      The binary the bootstrap runs (pre-downloaded so the connectivity check
      can run before you restart Codex).
  %USERPROFILE%\.codex\dash0-agent-plugin.local.md
      YAML-frontmatter config carrying your OTLP URL + auth token (owner only).
  %USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml
      Codex reads hooks from here (there is no hooks.json). This installer
      APPENDS a marker-delimited managed block registering the plugin's hooks
      AND pre-trusting them (Codex requires a persisted trusted_hash or it
      prompts via /hooks). Any hooks you authored yourself are preserved; the
      managed block is replaced on re-install and removed by
      uninstall-codex.ps1.

#
#    The command is written to the plain `command` field, not `commandWindows`:
#    the trust hash covers `command`, and the binary reproduces that hash, so a
#    Windows-only field would leave the hook untrusted. `powershell` resolves
#    from PATH under whatever shell Codex spawns the command with.
#
#    The binary writes the command as a single-quoted TOML literal string, which

#    C:\Users would be read as a unicode escape and the file would not parse.
