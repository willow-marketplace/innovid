# Development

## Releasing

> `scripts/release.sh <version>` executes the following release steps in one go.
>
Releases are automated with [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) via GitHub Actions. To create a new release, update the version in:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `version` field
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` — `version` field
- `copilot/plugin.json` — `version` field
- `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` — `metadata.version` and the plugin entry `version` (Copilot marketplace)
- `claude/claude-on-event.sh` — `VERSION=` line (Claude Code binary downloader)
- `cursor/cursor-on-event.sh` — `VERSION=` line (Cursor binary downloader)
- `codex/codex-on-event.sh` — `VERSION=` line (Codex binary downloader)
- `copilot/copilot-on-event.sh` — `VERSION=` line (Copilot binary downloader; vendored inside the `copilot/` subpath-install package)

> **Renaming a published asset.** The Claude marketplace lists this repo with no
> ref, so `claude plugin install` and `update` take the default branch. A
> checked-in bootstrap is therefore paired with the *last published* release, and a
> script that asks for a name that release does not carry breaks every fresh
> install until the next tag.
>
> `claude/claude-on-event.sh` handles this by trying each name it may have been
> published under, newest first, and using the first that resolves. Each installed
> script asks its own pinned release, and that release carries whichever name it
> was built with, so no commit on the default branch is ever inconsistent.
>
> The Claude asset is already switched: releases from v0.1.25 on publish
> `claude-on-event-<os>-<arch>`, and v0.1.24 and earlier carry the unprefixed
> `on-event-<os>-<arch>`. Drop the `on-event-<os>-<arch>` candidate from the script
> once no supported install can still be pinned to v0.1.24 or earlier. The local
> cache filename stays `on-event-<version>-<os>-<arch>` on purpose, because
> changing it would force every existing install to download again.
>
> The CI job "Release assets exist for configured version" reads the candidates out
> of each bootstrap and requires at least one to exist per platform, so a name that
> nothing publishes cannot pass unnoticed.

`main` is protected, so the script commits the version bump on a `release/v<version>` branch and pushes it — it does **not** push a tag. Open a PR from that branch and merge it.

After the PR is merged, tag the merged commit on `main` manually:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag v<version>
git push origin v<version>
```

The tag push triggers the release workflow which cross-compiles binaries for `darwin/linux × amd64/arm64` and publishes them to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dash0hq/dash0-agent-plugin/releases).
The `on-event-<agent>.sh` scripts download the matching binaries on first run.

See **[FEATURE_MATRIX.md](./FEATURE_MATRIX.md)** for the full per-runtime comparison
across configuration options, transferred span  properties, installation, debugging,
error handling, and user notifications.

## Per-runtime developer guides

Building, sideloading, and running local changes is documented per runtime:

- **Claude Code** — [claude/README.md](./claude/README.md)
- **Cursor** — [cursor/README.md](./cursor/README.md)
- **OpenAI Codex** — [codex/README.md](./codex/README.md)

## Telemetry attributes

Spans follow [GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/).

Identity, VCS, and team attributes go on **every** span, the rest depend on the span type.
Values are strings unless noted as integers.

> The four content attributes `gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`,
> `gen_ai.tool.call.arguments`, `gen_ai.tool.call.result` are replaced with `<REDACTED>`
> when `omit_io` is on (the default) and truncated to  16 KB otherwise.

> The three user-identity attributes behave according to `omit_user_info` (off by default):
> `user.name` becomes a 16-hex-char SHA-256 hash, `user.email` is
dropped entirely, and `process.working_directory` is home-dir-redacted to `~`.
> `dash0.gen_ai.user.identity.source` is not identifying and is never hashed.

> `user.name` falls back to the OS account when `git config user.name` is unset, so a
> developer with no git identity is still attributable. Set `omit_identity_fallback` to
> require a real git identity and drop the fallback instead.

### Span shape

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Span name | `chat <model>`, `invoke_agent <agent_type>` (sub-agent), or `execute_tool <tool_name>` |
| Span kind | `Internal` (always) |
| Status | `Unset` normally; `Error` (with `exception.message`) on `StopFailure` / `PostToolUseFailure` |
| Trace / parent IDs | random per turn, allocated at prompt submit; tool spans and sub-agents parent to the turn's chat span |

### Resource attributes

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `service.name` | Agent name — `claude-code` / `cursor` / `codex`, or the `agent_name` override |
| `service.version` | Plugin version (`dev` in source runs) |

### On every span

| Key | Value / Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_ai.provider.name` | `anthropic`, `openai`, `gcp.gemini`, `x_ai`, `deepseek`, `mistral_ai`, `cursor` | Resolved from the model prefix; else the runtime default (Claude `anthropic`, Codex `openai`; Cursor omits it when no model). |
| `gen_ai.agent.name` | Agent name, or the sub-agent type on `invoke_agent` spans                      | |
| `gen_ai.harness.name` | `claude-code` / `cursor` / `codex`                                             | |
| `dash0.team.name` | e.g. `platform`                                                                | Only when `team_name` is set. |
| `gen_ai.conversation.id` | Session ID                                                                     | From the event's `session_id`. |
| `process.working_directory` | e.g. `/home/me/proj`                                                           | `~`-redacted when `omit_user_info`. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.repository.url.full` | `https://github.com/dash0hq/dash0-agent-plugin`                                | git remote, normalized to https. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.repository.name` | `dash0-agent-plugin`                                                           | |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.owner.name` | `dash0hq`                                                                      | |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.provider.name` | `github` / `gitlab` / `bitbucket` / `gitea`                                    | From the remote host. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.ref.head.name` | e.g. `main`                                                                    | Branch or tag name. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.ref.head.revision` | commit SHA                                                                     | |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.ref.head.type` | `branch` or `tag`                                                              | |
| `user.name` | Real name, or a 16-hex-char SHA-256 hash when `omit_user_info`                 | From `git config user.name`, else the OS account. |
| `user.email` | git email                                                                      | git-only, never inferred. Omitted when `omit_user_info`. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.user.identity.source` | `git` or `os`                                                                  | Which source `user.name` came from. Emitted whenever a name is. |

The `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.*` keys are only present inside a git repository. The identity keys
(`user.*`, `dash0.gen_ai.user.identity.source`) are independent of it — they are emitted
outside a working tree too, since the user is still the user. Any individual key is
omitted when its value is empty.

#### Billing mode and rate limits

Cost is computed as provider list price × tokens. On a subscription there is no
per-token price at all — a flat fee buys a rationed allowance and the marginal
token is free — so that figure is a list-price *equivalent*, not spend.
`dash0.gen_ai.billing_mode` tells the consumer which it is.

**Allowance windows.** A plan enforces one or two windows at once, and you are
blocked when *either* exhausts. Codex models both slots as the same
`RateLimitWindow`, whose `window_minutes` it documents as "Rolling window
duration, in minutes".

**Which duration lands in which slot depends on the plan**, so read
`window_minutes` rather than assuming an ordering. Observed and inferred from
codex 0.142.5:

| Plan | `primary` | `secondary` |
|---|---|---|
| Free | monthly (`43200`) — observed | absent — observed |
| Paid | 5-hour (`300`) | weekly (`10080`) |

The paid row is inferred, not observed: the binary carries `five-hour-limit` and
`weekly-limit` status placeholders, and its reset-credit copy comes in exactly two
flavours — "Reset your current 5-hour and weekly usage limits" (a pair) versus
"Reset your current monthly usage limit" (alone).

A dashboard that assumes two windows renders empty for free-plan sessions, and one
that assumes `primary` is short mislabels them. A slot the plan omits is not
emitted.

The two windows answer different questions: a short window means blocked *now*,
recovering in hours; a long one means degraded for days. `reached_type` names which
window tripped, which is what separates "wait" from "upgrade" — that is why it is a
string rather than a boolean.

Two rules the reader holds to:

- **It never emits `api`.** A plan is only reported for ChatGPT-authenticated
  sessions, so an absent plan is *consistent with* API-key auth without proving
  it. Claiming `api` would assert the cost figure is real spend, which is the
  error this exists to prevent. Absence is `unknown`.
- **Unreported values are omitted, not zeroed.** "0% of allowance consumed" and
  "balance $0.00" read as measurements; a CLI that never reported them has made
  no such claim. Only `billing_mode` is unconditional, because recording that we
  looked and could not tell differs from never having looked.

The namespace is harness-neutral (`dash0.gen_ai.*`, not `dash0.codex.*`) because
the same mismatch exists for Claude Code (Max plans) and Copilot (per-seat, so
its cost figure is never spend). `dash0.codex.rollout.compressed` stays
Codex-scoped as a reader diagnostic.

### Tool-call spans (`execute_tool`)

| Key | Value / example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gen_ai.operation.name` | `execute_tool` | |
| `gen_ai.tool.type` | `function` | Constant. |
| `gen_ai.tool.name` | `Bash`, `Read`, … | MCP tool names are stripped of their `mcp__<server>__` prefix; the server goes to `dash0.gen_ai.tool.mcp_server`. |
| `gen_ai.tool.call.id` | Tool-use ID | |
| `gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` | Tool input (JSON / string) | Content-gated, ≤16 KB. |
| `gen_ai.tool.call.result` | Tool output | Content-gated, ≤16 KB. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.tool.mcp_server` | MCP server name (placeholder `cursor` on Cursor) | MCP tools only. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.tool.bash.command_family` | Binary name, e.g. `git`, `npm` | Bash tool. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.tool.skill.name` | Skill name | Skill tool. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.code.lines_added` | integer | Claude Code only — from the Edit/Write/MultiEdit `structuredPatch`. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.code.lines_removed` | integer | Claude Code only — from the Edit/Write/MultiEdit `structuredPatch`. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.pull_request.url` | PR / MR URL | Survives `omit_io`. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.issue.url` | Issue URL | Survives `omit_io`. |
| `dash0.gen_ai.vcs.commit.sha` | Commit SHA | Survives `omit_io`. |
| `exception.message` | Error text | On `PostToolUseFailure`. |
