# Bootstrap wrapper for the cursor-on-event binary. Installed at a stable
# user-owned path by the setup CLI; referenced by absolute path from Cursor's
# hooks.json so each hook invocation runs:
#
#   stdin (JSON) → cursor-on-event.sh → cursor-on-event binary → OTLP
#
# Fail-open: any error before exec'ing the binary logs to stderr and exits 0 so
# a broken installer never breaks the user's Cursor session. `set -e` is
# deliberately absent; fail_open does that job.
