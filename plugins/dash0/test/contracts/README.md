# Install / config contracts

Executable contract tests for the plugin install, credential-delivery, and
uninstall flows — the behaviour the runtime READMEs' *Installation* and
*Configuration* sections depend on. They run **locally** (while iterating on an
installer) and in CI (the `install-config-contract` job just calls these).

| Script | Contracts | Needs | Local? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude.sh` | settings.json ≠ install · `--config` credential storage · creds → OTLP | `claude` CLI, network, go/jq/curl | mostly anywhere; the credential-storage contract is **Linux-only** (see below) |
| `cursor.sh` | creds → OTLP · install layout + hooks merge · uninstall strip | network (install/uninstall resolve the latest release), go/jq/curl | yes |
| `codex.sh`  | creds → OTLP · install merge + pre-trust · uninstall strip | go/jq/python3/curl | yes (no codex CLI) |
| `bootstrap.sh` | all four `*-on-event.sh` stage the download in a temp and rename · concurrent cold-cache runs converge | curl, sha256sum/shasum; network for the concurrency contract | yes |

## Run

```bash
./test/contracts/run.sh            # all four
./test/contracts/run.sh codex      # one agent
```

Each script is hermetic — it uses throwaway `HOME`s under `/tmp` and a mock OTLP
server on `:4319`, so it never touches your real `~/.claude` / `~/.cursor` /
`~/.codex`.

## Notes

- **The `claude.sh` credential-storage contract is Linux-only.** It pins *where*
  `claude plugin install --config` persists credentials (non-sensitive →
  `settings.json`, `AUTH_TOKEN` → the secrets store, with a `.credentials.json`
  fallback on Linux). macOS uses the Keychain and a different layout, so it
  **skips** off Linux; CI (Linux) validates it.
- **`bootstrap.sh`'s concurrency contract skips when the pinned release isn't
  published**, including in CI — that is the normal state of a version-bump PR,
  and turning every one of those red would just train people to ignore it. The
  static contract in the same script runs unconditionally and is the one that
  actually holds the line.
- The `cursor.sh` install/uninstall contracts download the latest published
  release's Cursor binary, so they need network and an existing release. If the
  release can't be resolved they **skip locally but fail in CI** (`$CI` set) —
  a silently skipped contract would report green while testing nothing.
