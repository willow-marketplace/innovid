# Bootstrap download contracts (runnable locally and in CI):
#   - every *-on-event.sh downloads via a private temp and renames into place
#   - neither the scripts nor the Claude binary ends a hook non-zero
#   - an unrunnable cached binary neither errors nor re-downloads in a loop
#   - concurrent invocations against a cold cache all succeed and converge
#
# Hooks run concurrently — parallel tool calls each fire their own, and every
# session on the machine shares one plugin data directory — so the first run
# after a version bump has N processes finding no binary at once. Writing the
# final path directly made them interleave into one file: measured against
# v0.1.25, 48 of 48 staggered invocations failed, each computing a different
# checksum, plus one process's cleanup deleting the file another was chmod'ing.
#
# Requires: curl, bash, sha256sum or shasum. Network for the second contract.
