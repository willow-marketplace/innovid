.SYNOPSIS
Dash0 - Cursor telemetry installer for Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
The Windows counterpart of install-cursor.sh, section for section, so the two can
be compared side by side.

Windows PowerShell 5.1 is the target, because that is the version every Windows
install has: no ternary, no null-coalescing, no Join-Path with several child
paths. Everything it needs ships with Windows - curl.exe for downloads,
System.Security.Cryptography for checksums, ConvertFrom-Json in place of jq.

.EXAMPLE
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dash0hq/dash0-agent-plugin/main/install-cursor.ps1 | iex

.EXAMPLE
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-cursor.ps1 `
  -Endpoint https://ingress.us1.aws.dash0.com -Token dash0_... -Dataset default

.NOTES
Every flag is optional. A flag that is not supplied is prompted for, or left
blank in a non-interactive run - the plugin then installs but stays inactive
until the config file is filled in.

Env vars: DASH0_OTLP_URL, DASH0_AUTH_TOKEN, DASH0_DATASET, DASH0_TEAM_NAME,
DASH0_VERSION (pins a specific release), DASH0_RAW_REF (pins the git ref
the plugin files come from; for testing before a release),
DASH0_SKIP_PLUGIN_FILES=1 (leave the plugin files on disk alone; for testing a
locally staged build).
