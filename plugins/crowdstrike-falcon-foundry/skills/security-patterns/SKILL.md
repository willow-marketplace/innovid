Security patterns for Falcon Foundry app development covering authentication, input validation, UI security, and platform-specific considerations. Foundry apps run on a cybersecurity platform — security is a core requirement.

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

| Capability | RBAC Supported |
|-----------|----------------|
| Collections | Yes |
| Dashboards | Yes |
| Functions | Yes |
| UI extensions / pages / navigation | Yes |
| RTR scripts | Yes |
| API integrations | **No** |
| Queries | **No** |
| Workflows | **No** |

## API Scope Management

Scopes control which Falcon Platform APIs the app can access. Format: `<source>:<operation>` (e.g., `devices:read`, `detects:write`).

| Scopes set automatically | Scopes need explicit addition |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| API integrations, Collections, Dashboards, Queries, UI navigation, UI sockets, Workflows | Functions, UI extensions, UI pages, RTR scripts |

```bash
foundry auth roles create --name "Analyst" --description "Read-only analyst access"
foundry auth scopes add --scope "devices:read" --scope "detects:read"
```

Only use `foundry auth scopes add` for Falcon Platform API scopes needed by functions, UI extensions, UI pages, or RTR scripts. OAuth scopes for CLI-created artifacts are managed automatically.

### Minimal Scope Principle

Request only the scopes your app needs. Broad scopes like `alerts:*` or `hosts:*` increase the blast radius if the app is compromised.

```yaml
oauth_scopes:
  - "alerts:read"        # Read alerts — avoid "alerts:write" unless needed
  - "detections:read"    # Read detections
  - "hosts:read"         # Device information
```

## Credential Security

Credentials MUST be in environment variables, not in code. FalconPy handles credential discovery automatically inside FDK handlers (see functions-falcon-api):

```python
# Inside FDK handler — auth is automatic
falcon = Alerts()  # Do not pass credentials

# Outside handler (local testing) — use env vars
# FALCON_CLIENT_ID and FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET read automatically
```

## Input Validation

### JSON Schema for Collections

Use strict schemas to prevent data corruption and injection:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["timestamp", "event_type", "source"],
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "event_type": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["alert", "detection", "incident"]
    },
    "source": {
      "type": "string",
      "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$",
      "maxLength": 50
    }
  }
}
```

### API Response Sanitization

Sanitize CrowdStrike API responses before storing in Collections: remove sensitive fields (`raw_log`, `internal_id`, `system_metadata`), strip script injection, escape HTML entities, and truncate strings. See [references/security-examples.md](references/security-examples.md) for full implementation.

### Function Input Validation

Validate that input is a dict and enforce size limits (e.g., 10KB) to prevent abuse. Return generic error messages — MUST NOT expose stack traces or internal state in responses.

## UI Security

### XSS Prevention

- **React:** Use `DOMPurify.sanitize()` before any `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. React auto-escapes `{}` expressions.
- **Vue:** Use `DOMPurify.sanitize()` in a computed property before `v-html`. Vue auto-escapes `{{ }}` expressions.

For complete React and Vue XSS prevention components, see [references/security-examples.md](references/security-examples.md).

### Content Security Policy

Configure CSP in `manifest.yml` for UI pages:

```yaml
ui:
  pages:
    - name: my-page
      csp:
        connect_src:
          - "'self'"
          - "https://api.crowdstrike.com"
        img_src:
          - "'self'"
          - "data:"
        script_src:
          - "'self'"
```

### Iframe Security for Extensions

Extensions run in sandboxed iframes. Validate message origins against Falcon console domains:

```typescript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://falcon.crowdstrike.com',
  'https://falcon.eu-1.crowdstrike.com',
  'https://falcon.us-gov-1.crowdstrike.com',
];

window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (!allowedOrigins.includes(event.origin)) return;
  // Process event.data
});
```

For the full `SecureConsoleMessaging` class, see [references/security-examples.md](references/security-examples.md).

## Manifest Security Configuration

```yaml
app:
  name: "my-security-app"

oauth_scopes:
  - "alerts:read"
  - "hosts:read"

functions:
  - name: "process-alerts"
    language: "python"
    max_exec_duration_seconds: 30  # Prevent runaway execution
    max_exec_memory_mb: 128        # Limit resource usage

collections:
  - name: "audit_logs"
    ttl: 86400  # Auto-expire sensitive data (24 hours)
```

## Test Data Security

- Use only RFC 1918 IPs (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`) in mock data
- Use obviously fake hostnames and users (`test-workstation-01`, `test_user`)
- Validate mock data does not contain production indicators (`crowdstrike.com`, `falcon-`, `prod-`)
- Test XSS prevention with known attack vectors (`<script>`, `javascript:`, `onerror=`)

See [references/security-examples.md](references/security-examples.md) for mock data validation and CI/CD security patterns.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] OAuth scopes: minimal required permissions only
- [ ] Input validation: JSON schemas enforce strict validation
- [ ] XSS prevention: all user data sanitized before rendering
- [ ] CSP headers: Content Security Policy configured
- [ ] Postmessage security: origin validation implemented
- [ ] Secret management: no hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Function security: input size limits and timeout controls
- [ ] Collection security: access controls and data sanitization
- [ ] Test data: only fake data in tests and development
- [ ] Error handling: no sensitive data in error messages or logs
