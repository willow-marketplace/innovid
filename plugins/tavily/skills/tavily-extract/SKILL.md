name: tavily-extract
description: Extract clean markdown or text content from specific URLs via the Tavily CLI. Use this skill when the user has one or more URLs and wants their content, says "extract", "grab the content from", "pull the text from", "get the page at", "read this webpage", or needs clean text from web pages. Handles JavaScript-rendered pages, returns LLM-optimized markdown, and supports query-focused chunking for targeted extraction. Can process up to 20 URLs in a single call.

# tavily extract

Extract clean markdown or text content from one or more URLs.

## Before running

Run extract directly when `tvly` is available. Extract supports capped keyless
access, so do not look for an API key or authenticate before the first request.

If `tvly` is missing, follow the [tavily-cli setup](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md#setup)
before retrying. If the keyless cap is reached in an interactive session, run
`tvly login` to open browser OAuth, then retry the original extraction once. In
an unattended environment, report the cap and authentication options instead
of starting an interactive flow. Do not start a second login immediately after
guided setup has completed.

## When to use

- You have a specific URL and want its content
- You need text from JavaScript-rendered pages
- Step 2 in the [workflow](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md): search → **extract** → map → crawl → research

## Quick start

```bash
# Single URL
tvly extract "https://example.com/article" --json

# Multiple URLs
tvly extract "https://example.com/page1" "https://example.com/page2" --json

# Query-focused extraction (returns relevant chunks only)
tvly extract "https://example.com/docs" --query "authentication API" --chunks-per-source 3 --json

# JS-heavy pages
tvly extract "https://app.example.com" --extract-depth advanced --json

# Save to file
tvly extract "https://example.com/article" -o article.json
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--query` | Rerank chunks by relevance to this query |
| `--chunks-per-source` | Chunks per URL (1-5, requires `--query`) |
| `--extract-depth` | `basic` (default) or `advanced` (for JS pages) |
| `--format` | `markdown` (default) or `text` |
| `--include-images` | Include image URLs |
| `--timeout` | Max wait time (1-60 seconds) |
| `-o, --output` | Save the JSON response to a file |
| `--json` | Structured JSON output |

## Extract depth

| Depth | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `basic` | Simple pages, fast — try this first |
| `advanced` | JS-rendered SPAs, dynamic content, tables |

## Tips

- **Max 20 URLs per request** — batch larger lists into multiple calls.
- **Use `--query` + `--chunks-per-source`** to get only relevant content instead of full pages.
- **Try `basic` first**, fall back to `advanced` if content is missing.
- **Set `--timeout`** for slow pages (up to 60s).
- **Inspect `failed_results` even after exit code 0.** A successful request can
  still return no extracted pages. Retry the affected URL with `advanced` when
  appropriate, otherwise report the per-URL failure instead of treating the
  request as complete.
- If search results already contain the content you need (via `--include-raw-content`), skip the extract step.
