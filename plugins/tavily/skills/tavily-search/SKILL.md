description: Search the web with LLM-optimized results via the Tavily CLI. Use this skill when the user wants to search the web, find articles, look up information, get recent news, discover sources, or says "search for", "find me", "look up", "what's the latest on", "find articles about", or needs current information from the internet. Returns relevant results with content snippets, relevance scores, and metadata — optimized for LLM consumption. Supports domain filtering, time ranges, and multiple search depths.

# tavily search

Web search returning LLM-optimized results with content snippets and relevance scores.

## Before running

Run search directly when `tvly` is available. Search supports capped keyless
access, so do not look for an API key or authenticate before the first request.

If `tvly` is missing, follow the [tavily-cli setup](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md#setup)
before retrying. If the keyless cap is reached in an interactive session, run
`tvly login` to open browser OAuth, then retry the original search once. In an
unattended environment, report the cap and authentication options instead of
starting an interactive flow. Do not start a second login immediately after
guided setup has completed.

## When to use

- You need to find information on any topic
- You don't have a specific URL yet
- First step in the [workflow](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md): **search** → extract → map → crawl → research

## Quick start

```bash
# Basic search
tvly search "your query" --json

# Advanced search with more results
tvly search "quantum computing" --depth advanced --max-results 10 --json

# Recent news
tvly search "AI news" --time-range week --topic news --json

# Domain-filtered
tvly search "SEC filings" --include-domains sec.gov,reuters.com --json

# Include full page content in results
tvly search "react hooks tutorial" --include-raw-content --max-results 3 --json
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--depth` | `ultra-fast`, `fast`, `basic` (default), `advanced` |
| `--max-results` | Max results, 0-20 (default: 5) |
| `--topic` | `general` (default), `news`, `finance` |
| `--time-range` | `day`, `week`, `month`, `year` |
| `--start-date` | Results after date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--end-date` | Results before date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--include-domains` | Comma-separated domains to include |
| `--exclude-domains` | Comma-separated domains to exclude |
| `--country` | Boost results from country |
| `--include-answer` | Include AI answer (`basic` or `advanced`) |
| `--include-raw-content` | Include full page content (`markdown` or `text`) |
| `--include-images` | Include image results |
| `--include-image-descriptions` | Include AI image descriptions |
| `--chunks-per-source` | Chunks per source (advanced/fast depth only) |
| `-o, --output` | Save the JSON response to a file |
| `--json` | Structured JSON output |

## Search depth

| Depth | Speed | Relevance | Best for |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| `ultra-fast` | Fastest | Lower | Real-time chat, autocomplete |
| `fast` | Fast | Good | Need chunks, latency matters |
| `basic` | Medium | High | General-purpose (default) |
| `advanced` | Slower | Highest | Precision, specific facts |

## Tips

- **Keep queries under 400 characters** — think search query, not prompt.
- **Break complex queries into sub-queries** for better results.
- **Use `--include-raw-content`** when you need full page text (saves a separate extract call).
- **Use `--include-domains`** to focus on trusted sources.
- **Use `--time-range`** for recent information.
- **Verify identity-sensitive facts at the exact primary source.** For releases,
  versions, ownership, or similarly named projects, confirm the official
  repository or domain instead of trusting a generated answer or package-name
  match alone.
- Read from stdin: `echo "query" | tvly search - --json`
