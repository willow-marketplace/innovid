# Tavily Agent Skills

Web search, content extraction, site crawling, URL discovery, and deep research — powered by the Tavily CLI.

## Installation

### Recommended: guided CLI setup

Install the [Tavily CLI](https://github.com/tavily-ai/tavily-cli):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.tavily.com/install.sh | bash
```

On a fresh interactive desktop install, the installer starts `tvly init`
automatically. Otherwise run it after installation:

```bash
tvly init

# Prefer to open the sign-in link yourself
tvly init --no-browser
```

`tvly init` authenticates, detects Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, installs
these skills, and verifies a live search. It reuses an existing credential and
is safe to rerun. Skills installed this way are pinned to the CLI release, so
run `tvly update` before `tvly init` when refreshing them.

`tvly search` and `tvly extract` also work without authentication, subject to
a keyless rate-limit cap. Use `tvly init --skip-auth` to keep keyless mode while
installing the skills. `map`, `crawl`, and `research` require authentication.

Browser-based OAuth is the preferred interactive sign-in method. `--no-browser`
simply prints the sign-in link instead of opening it automatically; the flow
still returns to a localhost callback on the machine running `tvly`. In remote
sessions, make sure that callback is reachable (SSH may require port
forwarding). For unattended agents or CI, authenticate beforehand or provide
`TAVILY_API_KEY` securely so the process does not wait for human input.

### Manual skill installation

For other agents, or when you only want to install the skills:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/tavily-ai/skills
```

Install the CLI separately if needed:

```bash
uv tool install tavily-cli   # or: pip install tavily-cli
```

Then use `tvly init --skip-skills` for guided authentication and verification,
or `tvly login` when you only need to authenticate.

### Keep the CLI current

```bash
tvly update --check
tvly update
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |

## Workflow

Start simple, escalate when needed:

1. **Search** — Find pages on a topic (`tvly search "query" --json`)
2. **Extract** — Get content from a specific URL (`tvly extract "https://..." --json`)
3. **Map** — Discover URLs on a site (`tvly map "https://..." --json`)
4. **Crawl** — Bulk extract from a site section (`tvly crawl "https://..." --output-dir ./docs/`)
5. **Research** — Deep multi-source analysis (`tvly research "topic" --model pro`)
