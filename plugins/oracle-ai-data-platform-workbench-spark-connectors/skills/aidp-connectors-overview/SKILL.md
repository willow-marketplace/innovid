name: aidp-connectors-overview
description: Help the user pick the right connector skill for their data source from an AIDP notebook. Use as a router when the user mentions multiple sources, isn't sure which connector applies, or asks "how do I connect to X from AIDP". Covers 23 data sources — Oracle Autonomous DB family (ALH/ADW/ATP), generic Oracle DB, ExaCS, PeopleSoft, Siebel, Fusion ERP/BICC, EPM Cloud, Essbase, OCI Streaming, Object Storage, Iceberg, plus PostgreSQL, MySQL/HeatWave, SQL Server, Hive, Snowflake, Azure ADLS, AWS S3, Salesforce, generic REST, custom JDBC, Excel.

# `aidp-connectors-overview` — pick the right connector skill

## When to use
- The user is exploring options ("how do I connect to Oracle from AIDP?", "which connector should I use?").
- The user mentions multiple Oracle sources at once.
- The user describes a source by capability (e.g. "OLAP cube", "structured streaming") rather than naming the product directly.

## When NOT to use
- The user has already named their target product (ALH, ATP, Fusion, etc.) — invoke the matching `aidp-<product>` skill directly.

## How to route

**Before any connector skill works**, the helper package must be uploaded to the user's AIDP workspace. If the user hasn't done this yet (or you see `ModuleNotFoundError: oracle_ai_data_platform_connectors` in any prior cell), invoke [`aidp-connectors-bootstrap`](../aidp-connectors-bootstrap/SKILL.md) first. It uses the AIDP MCP tools to push the package into `/Workspace/Shared/` and runs a sanity-import notebook.

Otherwise, pick the right skill from this table and **invoke that skill**. Don't re-write its content here.

## What's blocked at the AIDP platform level (so you don't try)
- **Instance Principal** — IMDS (`169.254.169.254`) is unreachable from AIDP notebooks; signer either fails or runs in AIDP's service tenancy, not the customer's.
- **Resource Principal** — AIDP sets `AIDP_AUTH=resource_principal` but does NOT provide `OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_RPST` / `OCI_RESOURCE_PRINCIPAL_PRIVATE_PEM`, so `get_resource_principals_signer()` raises.

If the user wants either of those, point them at API Key + inline OCI config (`oracle_ai_data_platform_connectors.auth.from_inline_pem`) instead. The AIDP team is aware; pending Oracle action.

## Cross-cutting AIDP gotchas (every connector inherits these)
1. **Credentials live under `/tmp/`** — never `/Workspace/`. The latter is FUSE-mounted; intermittent disconnects + `os.chmod` no-op.
2. **Files written for the JDBC driver process** must be world-readable up-front via `os.open(..., O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0o666)`.
3. **Spark streaming checkpoints** must live under `/Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/<volume>/...`, never `/Workspace/`, never `oci://`.
4. **Refresh the AIDP session token** before live testing: `oci session authenticate --profile AIDP_SESSION --region us-ashburn-1`.
