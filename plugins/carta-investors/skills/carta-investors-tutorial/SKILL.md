# carta-investors Tutorial

You are running the **carta-investors plugin tutorial**. This is an interactive, gate-based
walkthrough — pause after each section and wait for the user to say "next", "continue", or
press Enter before proceeding.

---

## Section 0: Welcome

Welcome to the **carta-investors plugin** — your AI-powered assistant for fund data, portfolio
reporting, and LP insights, all connected directly to Carta's data warehouse.

In the next 5 minutes you'll see how to:
- Benchmark your fund's performance against peers for fundraising conversations
- Generate and download portfolio company tear sheets for LP reporting
- Pull a complete LP snapshot to prep for an investor call — in seconds

Say **"next"** to start.

## Section 1: What This Plugin Does

The carta-investors plugin gives you five capabilities:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Performance Benchmarks** | Compare fund IRR, TVPI, DPI, and MOIC against peer cohort percentiles |
| **Tear Sheets** | Generate and download PDF tear sheets for one portco or your entire portfolio |
| **Explore Data** | Query fund metrics, NAV, LP data, investments, and journal entries |
| **Fund Properties** | View and update fund terms, fees, KYC, and distribution settings |
| **Form ADV** | Pull regulatory AUM data for annual Form ADV and Form PF filings |

All data comes live from Carta's data warehouse — no spreadsheets, no exports.

Say **"next"** to verify your setup.

## Section 2: Verify Setup

Let me quickly check that everything is configured correctly.

[Call `mcp__carta__authenticate`]

- If the tool succeeds and Carta's real tools become available, you're authenticated — continue.
- If the tool returns an authorization URL, share it with the user and ask them to open it in their browser. Once they've authorized, ask them to paste the full callback URL from their browser's address bar, then call `mcp__carta__complete_authentication` with that URL.

Say **"next"** to start the demo.

## Section 3: Demo — Scenario 1: Fundraising Benchmarks

**The situation:** You're raising Fund IV and have an LP intro call next week. They'll ask how
Fund III performed. Let's see how it stacks up.

> *Imagine you just asked: "How does Redwood Growth Fund III compare to peers?"*

Here's what the plugin would return:

```
Redwood Growth Fund III — Performance vs. Peers
Vintage Year: 2019  |  AUM Bucket: $100M–$500M  |  Entity Type: VC

Metric        Your Fund    10th     25th     50th     75th     90th
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Net IRR        24.3%       4.2%    10.1%    16.8%    22.4%    31.7%
TVPI            2.1x       1.1x     1.4x     1.7x     2.0x     2.6x
DPI             0.6x       0.0x     0.1x     0.3x     0.6x     1.1x

Standing: Net IRR — 78th percentile  (Top Quartile)
```

Fund III is in the **top quartile** for its vintage. That's a headline number you can lead
with on the LP call.

To run this for real, just say: *"How does [your fund name] compare to peers?"*

Say **"next"** for Scenario 2.

## Section 4: Demo — Scenario 2: LP Reporting — Tear Sheets

**The situation:** You're putting together your Q1 LP update and need tear sheets for all
active portfolio companies.

> *Imagine you just asked: "Download tear sheets for all active portcos in Redwood Growth Fund III."*

Here's what happens:

1. The plugin lists your available tear sheet templates — you pick one
2. It shows all active portfolio companies grouped by fund
3. It kicks off bulk PDF generation and polls until ready
4. Returns a download link for your ZIP file

```
Found 3 active portfolio companies in Redwood Growth Fund III:
  1. Nova Dynamics
  2. Maple Street Health
  3. ClearPath Logistics

Generating tear sheets using "Standard VC Template"...
Status: Complete (3/3)

Your tear sheets are ready — click the link above to download.
```

Want to see what a finished tear sheet looks like? Here's a sample:

[Run `cp ~/.claude/plugins/cache/carta-plugins/carta-investors/*/assets/sample-tearsheet.pdf ~/Desktop/carta-sample-tearsheet.pdf`]

Open **carta-sample-tearsheet.pdf** on your Desktop to preview a real Carta tear sheet — including investment history, cap table, key financial metrics, and portfolio summary view.

You can also ask for a single portco preview before committing to a full download:
*"Show me the tear sheet for Nova Dynamics."*

Say **"next"** for Scenario 3.

## Section 5: Demo — Scenario 3: LP Meeting Prep

**The situation:** You have a call with Sequoia Pension Trust in an hour. They're your largest
LP. You want the full picture before you dial in.

> *Imagine you just asked: "I have a call with Sequoia Pension Trust in an hour. Get me ready."*

The plugin pulls from three data sources at once:

**LP account summary (PARTNER_DATA):**
```
LP: Sequoia Pension Trust
Commitment:           $25,000,000
Contributed to Date:  $18,750,000  (75%)
Distributions:         $4,200,000
Current NAV:          $31,100,000
Net Multiple:              1.66x
```

**Fund snapshot (MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS + AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS):**
```
Fund NAV (Q4 2024):    $142,300,000
Active Positions:      12
Top Holding:           Nova Dynamics  ($18.4M FMV)
```

**Benchmark standing:**
Net IRR 24.3% — 78th percentile for 2019 vintage VC

Then Claude asks: *"Want me to generate the tear sheet for Nova Dynamics to share on the call?"*

One prompt. Three data sources. Ready in seconds.

Say **"next"** to wrap up.

## Section 6: Wrap-Up

You've seen the three core workflows:

| Workflow | How to trigger |
|---|---|
| **Fundraising benchmarks** | "How does [fund name] compare to peers?" |
| **LP reporting tear sheets** | "Download tear sheets for [fund name]" |
| **LP meeting prep** | "I have a call with [LP name], get me ready" |

**Coming soon:** You'll be able to build and save custom reports directly in your Carta Data
Explorer firm folder and design custom tear sheets from scratch, right here.
