# Consolidating balance sheet

Generates a side-by-side Balance Sheet across every entity under a firm for a
single month, matching the "Balance Sheet - consolidating" tab format. The
data is pulled live from Carta's DWH via the Carta MCP connector — nothing is
embedded in the skill.

This skill runs primarily inside the **Claude for Excel** add-in. The audience
is an accountant working in their workbook, not an engineer running CLI
commands.


## When to use

Trigger this skill when the user asks for any of the following:

- "Give me the balance sheet of all the entities of `<FIRM>` for `<MONTH>`"
- "Consolidating balance sheet for `<FIRM>`"
- "BS by entity for `<FIRM>` `<MONTH>`"
- Any request to replicate the "Balance Sheet - consolidating" tab structure
  for another firm/period

Do **NOT** use this skill for:

- Single-entity balance sheets (use a plain trial-balance / GL query instead)
- P&L / income statement requests (use the **carta-consolidating-pnl** skill)
- Historical multi-period BS (this skill is point-in-time, single month)

## UX Rules

This skill ships as a standalone Claude for Excel skill, so the Carta CLI
session-start hook does **not** apply. The following rules — normally enforced
globally by the hook — are the skill's own responsibility here:

- **Speak plain English to the user.** The audience is an accountant.
  Never surface internal tokens in user-facing prose: MCP server identifiers
  (`claude_ai_Carta_Sandbox`), DWH column names (`ACCOUNT_TYPE`,
  `EFFECTIVE_DATE`), UUIDs, raw JSON, SQL, or gate labels. Those belong in
  Claude's own reasoning, not on screen.
- **Currency formatting:** positive `$X,XXX`, negatives `($X,XXX)`,
  totals bolded `**$X,XXX**`, never raw decimals.
- **Difference values are absolute** — `$0` for match, `$2,000` for a gap;
  never `-$2,000` in a difference column.
- **Status vocabulary** when reporting reconciliation outcomes:
  ✅ Match  |  ⚠ Mismatch ($X diff)  |  ❌ Missing in Carta  |  ❌ Missing
  in Client Doc.
- **Citation links** — when pointing to the resulting Excel range, format as
  `[A1:I65](<citation:Balance Sheet - Acme Mar-26!A1:I65>)` so the user
  can jump into the workbook. The range should match the actual written
  area (column B labels + N entity columns + Total column, by total row
  count) — adjust per build.
- **No environment URLs.** This skill builds Excel output, not Carta web
  links. There is no `BASE_URL` to construct.

## Environment detection (Claude for Excel)

This skill does **not** call `carta auth-status` — that command isn't
available inside the Excel add-in. Instead, the active Carta environment is
detected at Gate 0 from the connected MCP server's prefix
(`mcp__claude_ai_Carta_<Env>__fetch`). Treat the prefix discovery in Gate 0
as the equivalent of "Gate 0: Environment" in Carta CLI skills.

## Inputs to collect

Before running, confirm with the user:

1. **Firm name** — must match a firm reachable from the active Carta MCP
   context (resolved fuzzily). Example: `Acme Ventures`.
2. **Month** — format as `YYYY-MM` (e.g. `2026-03` for March 2026). The
   period is **cumulative as-of month-end** by default, not month-only
   activity (see `references/schema.md` for why).

If the user gave both in the request (e.g. *"balance sheet of all entities of
Acme Ventures for March 2026"*), proceed without re-asking.

---

## Execution discipline

Execute all gates silently. Do not narrate tool calls, intermediate results, or status updates. Only speak at explicit decision points: Gate 2 (entity scope picker), Gate 5 (pre-build review and approval), Gate 6 (output destination), and Gate 8 (post-action menu).

---

## Entry mode — fresh session vs. chained skill

**Mandatory telemetry beacon — run this before any skip-gate check:** If `<SERVER>` and `<FIRM_UUID>` are already in context, call `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})` as your very first action. Do not skip this even when all data is already available — it records this skill invocation. If either is unknown, it fires in Gate 0 below.

Before Gate 0, check whether these context variables are already set from an earlier skill call in the same session (e.g. chained from `carta-consolidating-pnl`):

- `<SERVER>` — connected Carta MCP server prefix
- `<FIRM_NAME>` and `<FIRM_UUID>` — the resolved firm

**If both are in context:** skip Gate 0 entirely. In Gate 1, skip the `contexts:list` lookup — but still call `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})` to re-anchor the MCP session scope and record this skill invocation, then proceed to `fa:list:entities` to enumerate entities for Gate 2.

**If either is missing** (fresh session or cold invocation): run Gate 0 and the full Gate 1 in order.

Do not ask "which firm?" when it is already established from the skill the user just ran.

---

## Gate 0: Identify the Carta MCP environment

1. Call `refresh_mcp_connectors`. Filter `servers[]` to `name` matching `Carta` / `Carta (…)` / `carta` with `status: "connected"`. Drop `failed`.
2. For each connected candidate, probe all three prefix forms in parallel: `mcp__claude_ai_Carta__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})` , `mcp__carta_production__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})`, and `mcp__carta__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})`. First success = `<SERVER>`.
3. **Don't call any other `mcp__<SERVER>__*` tool before `welcome`** — every other command is gated and will return a reminder.

If none connected, list `failed` connectors and stop. If multiple, default to `Carta` (production). Don't probe every prefix in `allowed-tools` — only `connected` ones.

---

## Gate 1: Resolve the firm and its entities

1. `mcp__<SERVER>__list_contexts(firm_name="<FIRM>", _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})` to find. Do not use `call_tool` for `list_contexts` — call the granular tool directly with `_instrumentation` as shown.
   the firm. If multiple matches, present them via `AskUserQuestion` and
   confirm.
2. `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]})` to scope the session. Do not use `call_tool` for `set_context` — call the granular tool directly with `_instrumentation` as shown.
3. `call_tool({"name": "fa__list__entities", "arguments": {}, "_instrumentation": {"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]}})` to enumerate **every** entity under
   the firm.

Prefer the granular tool when the server exposes it — one fewer hop, sidesteps `fetch`'s param-shape quirks:

| Granular tool | Generic equivalent |
|---|---|
| `mcp__<SERVER>__list_contexts(firm_name="<entity>")` | `call_tool({"name": "contexts__list", "arguments": {"firm_name": "<entity>"}})` |
| `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id="<uuid>")` | `call_tool({"name": "set_context", "arguments": {"firm_id": "<uuid>"}})` |

For DWH queries (`dwh:execute:query`, `dwh:list:tables`, `dwh:get:table_schema`) there is **no granular equivalent** — always go through `call_tool({"name": "…", "arguments": {…}})`.

Each entity returned from step 3 (`fa:list:entities`) has the display name, `entity_id`, and a type field (`entity_type_string` — e.g. `Fund`, `GP Entity`, `Management Co`, `SPV`, `Holding`, `Elimination Entity`, depending on the firm's structure). Cache the full list — Gate 2 reads from it.

**DWH param-name traps** — these cost a retry every time:
- `dwh:execute:query` takes `sql:`, **not** `query:` (the trailing `:query` in the command name is not the param key).
- `dwh:get:table_schema` takes `table_name:`, **not** `table:`.

Don't query `FUND_ADMIN` for entity metadata; the JE table is denormalized
and `FUND_NAME` is on every row.

**Done when:** the firm is locked and the full entity list (with type, if
available) is cached.

---

## Gate 2: Choose entity scope

Before pulling data, ask the user which entities to include. The default
("All entities") matches the legacy consolidating-BS behavior; the others
let the accountant trim noise from the output before any Excel write
happens.

Show a short summary first so the user knows what they're choosing from:

> **6 entities found under Acme Ventures:**
> - **Funds (3):** Acme Fund I, Acme Fund II, Acme Opportunity
>   Fund
> - **Other (3):** Acme Co-Invest (SPV), Acme GP LP (GP),
>   Acme SPV-1 (SPV)

(Group entities by `entity_type_string` if the field is available;
otherwise group by name pattern — common fund-name tokens are `Fund`,
`LP`, `LLC` with `Fund` in the name. Be conservative — when in doubt,
surface the entity in "Other".)

Then ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
Which entities should the Balance Sheet include?
1 - All entities (6)  ← recommended
2 - Funds only (3) — only fund-type entities
3 - Pick from a list — choose specific entities
4 - Type the names — comma-separated
```

Handle each branch:

- **1 — All entities** → keep every entity from Gate 1, with no type
  excluded by default.
- **2 — Funds only** → filter to entities whose `entity_type_string ==
  "Fund"`. If `entity_type_string` is not present in the API response,
  fall back to a conservative name pattern (case-insensitive `Fund` token
  in the display name). Show the resulting filtered list and confirm with
  `AskUserQuestion` before continuing — "Use these 3? Or pick
  individually?"
- **3 — Pick from a list** → present a multi-select `AskUserQuestion`
  where each option is one entity name. Require at least one selection.
- **4 — Type the names** → accept a comma-separated list as free text.
  Fuzzy-match each token against the cached entity names; show the
  resolved list and any unmatched tokens; confirm via `AskUserQuestion`
  before continuing. If any tokens are unmatched, loop until they're
  resolved or the user removes them.

Lock the chosen list as `<entity_scope>` and use it in Gate 3.

**Wait for the user to confirm before continuing.**

If the user picks an option that resolves to zero entities, stop and ask
them to re-pick — never run the BS query with an empty entity scope.

**Done when:** `<entity_scope>` is a non-empty, user-confirmed list of
entity display names from the Gate 1 cache.

---

## Gate 3: Pull journal entries

The schema and sign conventions for the Carta DWH journal-entries
table are documented in `references/schema.md`. Load that file now
and apply its rules.

**Default query — cumulative as-of (this is what balances):**

```sql
SELECT FUND_NAME, FUND_UUID, ACCOUNT_TYPE, ACCOUNT_NAME, SUM(AMOUNT) AS BALANCE
FROM <journal_entries_table>
WHERE FIRM_ID = '<firm_uuid>'
  AND EFFECTIVE_DATE <= '<YYYY-MM-DD month_end>'
  AND ACCOUNT_TYPE BETWEEN '1000' AND '3999'
  AND FUND_NAME IN (<comma-separated entity_scope names, quoted>)
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
ORDER BY FUND_NAME, ACCOUNT_TYPE
```

Use a `FUND_NAME IN (...)` clause only when `<entity_scope>` is **not**
the full Gate 1 list (i.e. the user picked options 2, 3, or 4). When the
user picked "All entities" (option 1), omit the `FUND_NAME` filter so the
query plan stays simple.

Single-quote each name in the `IN (...)` clause and escape any embedded
single quotes by doubling them (e.g. `O'Connor` → `'O''Connor'`).

### DWH result formatting — keep the response small

For monthly / per-account / per-period activity queries that return more than ~50 rows, request `format: "ndjson"` and bucket the result into a blob (`store_blob` / `blobs.setJSON` / the runtime equivalent) before working with it. Do not paste large query results back into the conversation — they trigger `context_snip`, which can compress your Gate 4 / Gate 5 checks out of user visibility.

Supported `format` values for `dwh:execute:query`:
- `markdown` — best for small (≤50 row) results that you want to show the user.
- `ndjson` — best for large results processed by code/agent.
- `csv` is NOT supported. Do not try it.

Run via `call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__query", "arguments": {"sql": "..."}, "_instrumentation": {"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]}})`.
SELECT-only.

**Period-only variant** (`EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN <month_start> AND
<month_end>`) — run **only** if the user explicitly asks for "this month's
activity" or "period-only." Warn them first: it will not balance, because BS
accruals booked during the month have offsetting P&L entries excluded by the
`ACCOUNT_TYPE` filter.

If the result set is large, store it in a session blob (e.g.
`blobs.setJSON("bs_data", ...)`) instead of carrying it in the prompt.

### Resolve the presentation currency (`<fund_currency>`)

The number format in `references/formatting.md` is built from `<fund_currency>` —
resolve it here, do **not** assume USD:

1. Probe the journal-entries table for a currency column:
   `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", "arguments": {"table_name": "<journal_entries_table>"}, "_instrumentation": {"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-balance-sheet"]}})`.
   If it exposes a currency column (e.g. `CURRENCY`, `REPORTING_CURRENCY`,
   `FUND_CURRENCY`), add `SELECT DISTINCT <currency_col>` scoped to
   `<entity_scope>` and read the value(s).
2. If exactly one distinct currency comes back, set `<fund_currency>` to it.
3. If the column doesn't exist, or the scope spans **multiple** currencies
   (a consolidating BS that mixes currencies cannot be summed into one Total
   column — see the no-cross-currency rule), ask the user via
   `AskUserQuestion`: *"What presentation currency should I use for this
   consolidating balance sheet?"* Store the answer as `<fund_currency>`.

Never silently default to USD.

**Done when:** the period dataset is loaded (covering only Asset / Liability /
Equity accounts) — scoped to `<entity_scope>` — and `<fund_currency>` is resolved.

---

## Gate 4: Classify accounts

Classify each row by the leading digit of `ACCOUNT_TYPE`, per
`references/schema.md`:

- `1xxx` → **Assets** — keep `BALANCE` as-is
- `2xxx` → **Liabilities** — multiply `BALANCE` by `-1` for positive display
- `3xxx` → **Equity** — multiply `BALANCE` by `-1` for positive display

Sort within each section by `ACCOUNT_TYPE` ascending. Use `ACCOUNT_NAME`
directly as the row label — do not rename or consolidate accounts.

**Done when:** every account has a section and a positive display value.

---

## Gate 5: Pre-build review

Before touching the user's workbook, show a plain-English preview so the
accountant can sanity-check the build and edit if anything looks off. This
is the pre-flight checkpoint — no Excel changes happen until the user
explicitly confirms.

Present a short, scannable summary. Echo back the **scope choice from Gate
2** so the user can see exactly what's in and what's out:

> **Ready to build the Balance Sheet — please review.**
>
> - **Firm:** Acme Ventures
> - **Period:** as of March 31, 2026 (cumulative)
> - **Entity scope:** Funds only (3 of 6) — Acme Fund I, Acme
>   Fund II, Acme Opportunity Fund
>   *(Excluded: Acme Co-Invest, Acme GP LP, Acme SPV-1.)*
> - **Accounts found:** 22 Assets, 11 Liabilities, 7 Equity (40 total)
> - **Sheet name:** `Balance Sheet - Acme Mar-26`

If the user picked "All entities" in Gate 2, render the scope line as:

> - **Entity scope:** All entities (6) — Acme Fund I, Acme Fund
>   II, Acme Co-Invest, Acme GP LP, Acme Opportunity Fund,
>   Acme SPV-1

Then ask with `AskUserQuestion`:

```
1 - Build it  ← recommended
2 - Change the firm or period
3 - Change the entity scope
4 - Cancel
```

Handle each branch:

- **1 — Build it** → proceed to Gate 6.
- **2 — Change firm or period** → return to Inputs, re-run Gates 1–4 with
  the new values, then present this review again.
- **3 — Change the entity scope** → return to **Gate 2** (the
  entity-scope picker). On confirm, re-run Gates 3–4 with the new scope,
  then present this review again.
- **4 — Cancel** → stop the skill cleanly.

**Loop until the user picks "Build it" or cancels.** Never write to Excel
based on inferred intent.

**Do not** surface internal field names (`ACCOUNT_TYPE`, `FUND_NAME`,
`EFFECTIVE_DATE`) or UUIDs in this review — translate to plain accountant
language ("accounts", "entities", "as of …").

**Hard rule: no workbook-write tool (Excel-add-in cell write, `execute_office_js` that mutates state, `write_workbook.py`, or any equivalent) runs before this gate's `AskUserQuestion` returns the user's explicit "Approve and write" choice.** If you catch yourself about to call a workbook-write tool without that approval recorded, stop and run this gate first.

**Done when:** the user has confirmed the build, with their chosen firm,
period, and entity scope locked in.

---

## Gate 6: Decide the output destination

This skill is designed to run inside the **Claude for Excel** add-in.
Before writing anything, decide whether to write into the user's currently
open workbook or to create a new one.

1. **Check for an active workbook.** Use the Excel add-in's
   "active workbook" / "current workbook" tool (whatever name the add-in
   exposes at runtime) to see if there is a workbook open in front of the
   user.
2. **If a workbook is open**:
   - Read the workbook name and the full list of existing sheet/tab names.
   - **Scan for a matching existing tab (COA label detection).** For each
     existing tab, read all non-empty cell values from column B via
     `execute_office_js`. Compare them against the `ACCOUNT_NAME` values
     in the Gate 4 dataset. A tab is a **COA-label match** if ≥ 5 account
     labels from the current query appear in that tab's column B. An
     **exact-name match** is a tab whose name equals the proposed sheet
     name (`Balance Sheet - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>`). Check for
     both — a renamed tab can match on labels even when its name differs.
   - **If a matching tab is found (exact-name or COA-label):** ask the
     user via `AskUserQuestion`, naming the matched tab explicitly:
     > **"I found an existing tab `<matched_tab_name>` that appears to
     > contain balance sheet data for this firm. What would you like to
     > do?"**
     > Options:
     > - **"Update the existing `<matched_tab_name>` tab"** — clear and
     >   rebuild it in place. ← recommended
     > - **"Create a new tab instead"** — adds a new tab named
     >   `Balance Sheet - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>` (with a numeric suffix
     >   like `(2)` if that name also already exists; truncate to Excel's
     >   31-character limit after suffixing).
     > - **"Cancel"** — stop the skill.
   - **If no matching tab is found:** ask the user whether you may add a
     new tab to the workbook. Example:
     > **"You have `<workbook name>.xlsx` open. May I add a new tab called
     > `Balance Sheet - Acme Mar-26` to it?"**
     > Options:
     > - **"Yes, add the tab here"** — proceed with the active workbook.
     > - **"No, create a new workbook instead"** — create a fresh workbook.
     > - **"Cancel"** — stop the skill.
   - **If the user picks "Update existing tab":** clear the matched tab's
     used data range before writing:
     ```javascript
     const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<matched_tab_name>");
     sheet.getUsedRange().clear();
     await context.sync();
     ```
     Then proceed to Gate 7 using `<matched_tab_name>` as the target
     sheet (the sheet already exists — do not call `create_sheet`).
3. **If no workbook is open**:
   - Create a new workbook silently. Name it `Balance Sheet -
     <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>.xlsx` (e.g. `Balance Sheet - Acme
     Mar-26.xlsx`). The first sheet is the consolidating Balance Sheet
     tab.
   - Tell the user, in one sentence, that you created a new workbook
     because nothing was open.
4. **If the user cancels** or denies edit permission for the active
   workbook **and** picks "Cancel": stop the skill cleanly. Don't fall
   back silently to creating a new file.

Lock the chosen `<destination workbook>` and `<sheet name>` and use them
through Gate 7 and Gate 8.

**Done when:** the destination workbook + target sheet name are known and
the user has explicitly consented to any edit to a pre-existing workbook.

---

## Gate 7: Build and brand the output sheet

### Approval-recorded check (run FIRST, before any write tool)

Before calling `execute_office_js` with state-mutating code, `setValues`, `write_workbook.py`, or any other workbook-write tool, look back at your tool history. Find the most recent `AskUserQuestion` you sent. Does its answer literally include `"Build it"` (the Gate 5 build-approval)? If NO, Gate 5 did not pass — send the Gate 5 approval menu now and wait for the explicit answer.

**Do not interpret upstream answers as approval.** An entity-scope response from Gate 2, a destination response from Gate 6, or any prior `AskUserQuestion` whose answer is not literally a build-approval choice does NOT clear this gate.

### Gate 7 requires AT LEAST three separate `execute_office_js` calls (excel-addin runtime)

The most common failure mode is bundling cell writes + formatting + logo into one `writeSheet(...)` function — the model writes the cells, returns, and forgets the logo. **Do not combine the cell-write call with the brand block in a single office.js block.**

- **Call 1:** cell values, formulas, formatting. One `execute_office_js`. Return.
- **Call 2:** logo on the BS tab via the verbatim brand block below.
- **Call 3 (verification, LAST):** load shape names on the BS tab, confirm `CartaLogo` exists.

Returning from Call 1 does NOT finish Gate 7. The verification call must appear in your tool history before Gate 8.

Read `references/formatting.md` now and apply its layout exactly. That file
covers sheet name, header rows, section headers, subtotal/grand-total rows,
the Total column, number formats, column widths, font, and the "do not
include" list.

**Also read [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md)** for the standard 4-row metadata band (B1 firm / B2 descriptive title like `"Consolidating Balance Sheet · As of Mar-26"` / B3 source / B4 other context) and Carta logo placement (column E, rows 1–3 height). If `formatting.md` and `branding-and-header.md` disagree on where section headers start (e.g. `formatting.md` says `B5 = Assets`), the branding spec wins — shift sections to start at row 6 or below so rows 1–4 stay reserved for metadata.

### Brand block — verbatim, run AFTER the cell writes (DO NOT SKIP)

The output sheet is not "built" until it carries a `CartaLogo` shape. Use the verbatim brand block from [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md) — substitute `<TAB_NAME>` with the BS tab name. Asset access via `blobs.getText("assets/powered_by_carta.b64.txt")` — NOT `Read` or filesystem paths.

**Brand-verification call (REQUIRED, observable).** Run this as a **separate** `execute_office_js` call before proceeding to Gate 8:

```javascript
const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<BS_TAB_NAME>");
sheet.shapes.load("items/name");
await context.sync();
return sheet.shapes.items.map(s => s.name);
```

The result must include `"CartaLogo"`. If not, re-run the brand block above and re-verify. **Do not proceed to Gate 8 until this verification returns `CartaLogo`.** The verification call is observable evidence; without it in your tool history, Gate 7 branding is not complete.

Two critical reminders from that reference:

- Write the Total-column **header** (e.g. `Mar-26`) with `numFmt = "@"`
  applied **before** setting the value. Otherwise Excel parses it as a date
  serial.
- Every total is a `=SUM(...)` formula, never a hardcoded number. The Total
  column sums across entities; section subtotals sum down the section.

**Empty entities**: if an entity in `<entity_scope>` has no JE activity
through the as-of date, still include the column with zeros — not blanks.

### Sheet-write hard rules

- **`range.merge(true)` discards values in trailing cells.** Never merge
  cells whose contents you still need. To add a header row above
  existing sub-headers, **insert a new row first**
  (`sheet.getRange("5:5").insert(...)`) and write the merged labels
  into the inserted row — do not merge over a row that already holds
  sub-headers.
- **Two-row header pattern** when bucketing by period: row N = one merged
  cell per period (e.g. `Mar-26`, `Apr-26`); row N+1 = sub-headers if
  any. Never write the period label and any sub-headers into the same row.
- The date-serial trap (already called out above for the Total-column
  header) applies to **every** cell where you write a month/period string.
  Set `numFmt = "@"` **before** the value, or apply
  `numberFormat: "mmm yyyy"` to a real date in the same write.

**Done when:** the sheet exists with one column per entity in
`<entity_scope>`, all account rows, all subtotals, and the grand-total
row, all driven by formulas.

---

## Gate 8: Verify and report

**Gate 8 precondition (DO NOT SKIP).** Before sending the report text below, scan your tool history. Three anchors MUST be present in that order:

1. An `AskUserQuestion` whose answer included `"Build it"` (Gate 5 build-approval).
2. A `sheet.shapes.addImage(base64)` call for the BS tab — Gate 7 branding.
3. The branding-verification `execute_office_js` whose result included `"CartaLogo"` — Gate 7 verification.

If any anchor is missing, you have skipped a gate. **Do NOT report build success when no `shapes.addImage` call appears in your tool history.** STOP, go back, run the missing gate, then return here.

After writing:

1. Read back the `Total Assets` and `Total Liabilities and Equity` rows.
   They should match per entity (BS must balance).
2. Flag any entity where `|Total Assets - Total Liabilities and Equity| >
   1000` (more than $1k off in raw dollars). Imbalance usually means the
   COA has accounts that didn't classify cleanly into Assets, Liabilities,
   or Equity.

**Report structure:**

Lead with a one-line confirmation, then a **Key tie-outs** block, then the
detail. Status vocabulary: ✅ Match, ⚠ Mismatch ($X diff).

If any entity does **not** foot, surface its row with status `⚠ Mismatch
($X diff)` and a short note pointing the user at the likely cause
(unclassified account, COA digit drift, period-only variant ran by
mistake).

Then offer the post-action menu:

**The next-step menu MUST be a single `AskUserQuestion` call** with the options below as `options` entries. Never render them as a numbered markdown list, a bulleted list, or inline prose — bare-text menus break the chooser UI in Claude for Excel and force the user to type the number. The `← recommended` marker goes inside the `description` field of one option, not as a suffix on the `label`.

1. **Build the P&L for the same firm and period** ← recommended
2. **Build the Balance Sheet for a different period**
3. **I'm done**

**When the user selects an option, immediately invoke the corresponding skill via `Skill('<skill-name>')` BEFORE doing any work.** Do not freelance the output — load the downstream skill's SKILL.md so its gates, layout spec, branding rules, and approval flow apply. Routing:

| Option | Skill to invoke |
|---|---|
| 1 — Build the P&L | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-consolidating-pnl')` |
| 2 — Build the Balance Sheet for a different period | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-consolidating-balance-sheet')` re-entry with the new period |
| 3 — I'm done | No invocation; close cleanly |

**Done when:** sheet exists, Key tie-outs reported with status per entity,
post-action menu rendered.

## Schema discovery

The skill queries the Carta DWH journal-entries table. If column
names are needed, look up the table via the Carta MCP DWH schema
command once at Gate 0 — production schema is canonical. Don't embed
column listings inline; the DWH contract can drift.

## Error handling

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| No Carta MCP tool present | The Carta connector isn't enabled in this Claude for Excel session | "I can't see your Carta connector. Open **Settings → Connectors** in Claude, enable Carta, then ask me again." |
| `contexts:list` returns no firm | Firm name typo, or the user's MCP context doesn't include this firm | Echo back the name and ask for confirmation or an alternative spelling. Don't silently pick a near-match. |
| `contexts:list` returns multiple firms | Common short names match several firms | Show the candidates via `AskUserQuestion` and let the user pick. |
| Query returns 0 rows | No JE activity for the firm through the as-of date | "I didn't find any journal entries for this firm through Mar 31, 2026. Double-check the period or confirm books are open for that month." |
| Query times out | DWH load, or unusually large date range | Tell the user the query is slow and offer to retry with the same parameters — never auto-retry. |
| BS doesn't balance per entity | COA accounts not in 1xxx/2xxx/3xxx, or period-only variant ran by mistake | Surface the per-entity imbalance in Gate 8's Key tie-outs table. Suggest reviewing the unclassified accounts. |
| Auth / permission error from MCP | The user's Carta session expired or lacks DWH access | Tell them to reconnect Carta in Settings → Connectors. Do not retry automatically. |

Never auto-retry a failed command. Always surface the failure and let the
user decide whether to retry.

## Do NOT

- **Don't skip Gate 2** by inferring entity scope from chat. User must explicitly pick — even if the prompt says "all entities", echo the resolved list and confirm.
- **Don't run BS query with empty entity scope.** Zero entities → stop, ask user to re-pick.
- **Don't exclude any entity type by default.** "All entities" in Gate 2 means every entity Gate 1 returned, full stop.
- **Don't include Topside Adjustments or prior-period columns.** The only non-entity columns are per-entity columns plus Total.
- **Don't rename accounts.** Use `ACCOUNT_NAME` from JE verbatim.
- **Don't run period-only variant** without explicit opt-in and a "won't balance" warning.
- **Don't claim success** without re-reading and verifying per-entity balance in Gate 8.
- **Don't skip branding.** Gate 8 report must not run until the tab carries `CartaLogo` on column E — see [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md).
- **Do NOT freeze panes** on this tab.
