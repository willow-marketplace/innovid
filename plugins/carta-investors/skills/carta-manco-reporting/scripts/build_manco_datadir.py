"""build_manco_datadir.py — assemble snapshot.json + accounts.json from raw MCP query dumps.

The skill's flow (SKILL.md):
  1. Resolve firm/ManCo over Carta MCP → firm_uuid, manco_uuid, carta_ids
  2. Run 4 SQL queries (via `dwh__execute__query`) + the cash-balance call
     (via `fa__get__cash-balance`) + monthly budget calls (via
     `fa__list__budgets`). Save each result verbatim under the raw dir as
     pipe-tables / JSON.
  3. Run THIS script to parse those raw dumps into the two JSON files the
     React app reads.

Keeping the fetch (LLM in SKILL.md, has MCP access) separate from the
assembly (this pure Python script, deterministic) makes the pipeline
debuggable: rerun the script with a fixed raw dir and the output is stable.

Expected files under --raw-dir (relative paths):
  reimbursement-entries.txt  — (optional) gluuids of entries settled through
                               the firm's reimbursement payable
  je-expense-page1.txt       — ACCOUNT_TYPE >= 5000 JE lines, first 1000 rows
  je-expense-page2.txt       — (optional) rows 1000+; the LLM writes it only when total_rows > 1000
  je-income.txt              — ACCOUNT_TYPE 4000-4999 JE lines
  fund-fees.txt              — cross-fund mgmt fee JEs 2021 onwards
  cash-balance.json          — fa:get:cash-balance response for the ManCo entity
  budget-<year>-01.json .. -12.json — fa:list:budgets per-month payloads (may be empty; all 12 months)

Written to --dashboard-dir:
  snapshot.json — KPI-level dashboard payload (firmName, ops, cash, budget, feeSchedule, monthlyCashflow, spendByGL)
  accounts.json — per-account rollup + full entry list + fund-fee entries

Stdlib-only, Python 3.9-safe.

      bars on the top-10 GL chart.
