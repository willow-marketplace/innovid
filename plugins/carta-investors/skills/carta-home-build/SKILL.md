name: carta-home-build
description: Builds or rebuilds the Carta Home live artifact — a Cowork dashboard home page that works for any Carta firm. Shows a live Schedule of Investments, Fund Performance benchmarks, P&L (from STATEMENT_OF_OPS), Balance Sheet (from MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS), LP Reporting, Portfolio Valuations (top holdings by MOIC), ManCo expense actuals by category, Form ADV regulatory AUM, and a Skill Directory with one-click copyable prompts. The artifact auto-detects the active firm from the Carta MCP context — no hardcoded firm name needed. Use this skill whenever the user asks to "build the carta home artifact", "rebuild carta home", "set up the carta home page", "deploy carta home", or "restore the carta home dashboard".

<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>", "surface": "<value>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.
`surface` is the Claude surface you are running in: `"chat"` (claude.ai or the Claude app, i.e. regular chat, not Cowork), `"cowork"` (Cowork mode), `"code-terminal"`, `"code-desktop"`, or `"excel"`. Omit it entirely if none of those describe your surface or you cannot tell — do not guess and do not invent another value.

# Carta Home — Build / Redeploy

Deploys the `carta-home` live artifact. It is **assembled** from source parts in
this skill's `resources/` directory (template + CSS + config + app JS) by
`scripts/build_artifact.py`, which also substitutes this session's Carta connector name.
You never need to read the assembled HTML — see "Source layout" below.

## What the artifact does

- **Schedule of Investments (SOI)** — live portfolio table with fund-level totals, gain/loss
  coloring, and company drill-down. Pulled from `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS`.
- **Fund Performance** — Net IRR, TVPI, DPI charts vs. peer benchmarks. Pulled from
  `FUND_ADMIN.TEMPORAL_FUND_COHORT_BENCHMARKS` — queries all funds for the active firm
  automatically (no hardcoded fund names).
- **P&L Card** — Unrealized gain/loss and total expenses from `FUND_ADMIN.STATEMENT_OF_OPS`
  (pre-aggregated, fast — no journal entry scan).
- **Balance Sheet Card** — Portfolio value, LP NAV, GP NAV, Total NAV from
  `FUND_ADMIN.MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` with `IS_FIRM_ROLLUP = TRUE` (latest month).
- **LP Reporting & Relations** — links to tear sheet downloads, LP documents, and LP dashboard.
- **Valuations** — top 5 holdings by MOIC from `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS`. Shows
  company name, FMV, and MOIC with color coding (green ≥ 2x, blue ≥ 1x, red < 1x).
- **ManCo & Budgeting** — YTD expense actuals by category from `FUND_ADMIN.STATEMENT_OF_OPS`.
  Shows the top 5 categories by spend (management fees, legal, fund admin, audit, tax prep,
  payroll, software, other) with a total footer. Run button triggers the budget vs actuals skill.
- **Compliance (Form ADV)** — Discretionary AUM, Non-discretionary AUM, and Total Regulatory
  AUM. Tries `FUND_ADMIN.FORM_ADV_FUND_DETAIL` first; falls back to `FUND_ADMIN.MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS`
  total NAV as a proxy if that table is unavailable (adds a footnote when using the fallback).
- **Skill Directory** — categorized index of carta-investors skills with copyable prompts.
  Prompts auto-substitute the active firm name. Every category shows to every role.
  **Entitlement-gated:** `fetchUserEnrichment()` calls `get_current_user`, logs the full
  payload to the debug console (visible to the LLM client), and reads two product flags:
  - **Fund forecasting** (a single skill inside Fund modeling) — needs `has_tactyc`
  - **ManCo & budgeting** (the whole category) — needs `has_active_manco`

  `requires` sits on a category or on one skill. A category whose every skill is gated
  out hides as well. A gated item hides only when its flag is an explicit `false`. Anything
  else — enrichment unavailable, the call failed, the key absent or `null`, a staff account
  whose enrichment is stripped — shows it. Seeing too much beats seeing nothing.
- **Firm auto-detection** — calls `list_contexts` without a firm name filter; extracts the
  active firm UUID and name from the response. All DWH queries use `FIRM_ID = '${firmId}'`
  dynamically — the artifact works for any Carta firm with no code changes.
- **Capital Activity** (`resources/app/capital-activity.js`) — pinned cards for active capital
  calls and distributions from `fa:list:active-capital-activity`, with a detail overlay
  listing each LP partner's amount, status, and date — paid date once paid, days late while
  outstanding. On a capital call, unpaid partners get **Send Reminder** (**Resend**, over the
  last-reminded date, once one has gone out), which previews and then sends the email via
  `fa:send:capital-call-reminder`. Rows with `email_notice_enabled: false` show a muted
  **Email disabled** and no menu — the backend drops those sends silently. **Remind investors**
  in the summary row batches the same send: a selection table of the remindable investors (all
  checked to start), then a preview with a picker over each one's own email. One entry per
  interest group, since the backend collapses a group's rows into a single email. The preview
  is the confirmation: snoozing it means the next click sends, and a sent batch reads
  **Sent just now** for 24h (`caBulkRemindedAt`).

## MCP tools required inside the artifact

The artifact resolves the runtime bridge once with `await claude.use("mcp")`, then calls
`mcp.callTool(CARTA_MCP_SERVER, "<tool>", args)`. `CARTA_MCP_SERVER` is the Carta
connector's **display name** — the `{{CARTA_MCP_SERVER}}` placeholder the build script
fills in. The runtime addresses connectors by display name only, never by a UUID.

Every tool below must appear in the publish call's `capabilities.mcp` grant, or the call
rejects with `not_in_manifest`:

- `welcome` — re-initializes an expired MCP session
- `list_contexts` — auto-detects the active firm
- `set_context` — activates the firm's DWH session
- `fetch` — all DWH queries (SOI, P&L, BS, benchmarks, tear sheets)
- `get_current_user` — signed-in user's profile; `has_tactyc` and `has_active_manco` gate
  their Skill Directory categories (see `fetchUserEnrichment`)
- `mutate` — the legacy write dispatcher, granted as a fallback; nothing in `resources/`
  calls it
- `call_tool` — the gateway dispatcher, carrying both the Capital Activity reminder sends
  (`fa__send__capital-call-reminder`) and the Plugin news live-content cards

## Source layout — the artifact is BUILT, not hand-edited

The deployed artifact is assembled from source parts in `resources/` by
`scripts/build_artifact.py`. **Do NOT read or edit the assembled HTML** — you never
need the full file in context. Edit the small source file for what you're changing:

| File | What it holds | Edit it to… |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `resources/carta-home.config.js` | `DIR_CATEGORIES` + per-category `requires` | change which skills/categories show, or their entitlement gate |
| `resources/carta-home.app.js` | shared/core runtime logic (`_mcp`, format helpers, `fetchLiveData` bootstrap, SOI, Fund Performance, Skill Directory, tour) | change behavior / data fetching for anything not yet split into its own file below |
| `resources/app/capital-activity.js` | Capital activity cards + detail overlay (fetch/render/dismiss) | change the capital call / distribution cards or their detail modal |
| `resources/app/version-check.js` | update banner: reads the published version, compares, renders/dismisses | change the banner copy or when it appears |
| `../../.claude-plugin/skill-versions.json` | this skill's `version` + release `headline` | **bump on every user-visible change** — see Versioning |
| `resources/carta-home.css` | styles (Ink tokens) | change appearance |
| `resources/carta-home.template.html` | HTML skeleton + injection markers | change page structure |
| `resources/carta-home.tracker.js` | inlined `@carta/mcp-ui-tracker` browser bundle (`window.mcpUiTracker`) | re-run the library's `build:browser` and re-copy the output if the tracker source ever changes |
| `resources/carta-home.chart.js` | inlined Chart.js v4.5.1 UMD | bump only to change Chart.js versions — never link it from a CDN, the CSP blocks that |

App-layer JS is split across multiple files (see `APP_JS_PARTS` in
`build_artifact.py`) but still assembles into a single classic (non-module)
`<script>` tag — no bundler, no runtime `import`/`export`. New feature files
just get appended to `APP_JS_PARTS` and concatenated in order; a file's header
comment documents which shared helpers it depends on from elsewhere in the
bundle.

The build inlines `carta-home.css` → `/* __CARTA_HOME_CSS__ */`, `carta-home.tracker.js`
→ `/* __CARTA_HOME_TRACKER_JS__ */`, `carta-home.config.js` → `/* __CARTA_HOME_CONFIG_JS__ */`,
and the concatenated `APP_JS_PARTS` → `/* __CARTA_HOME_APP_JS__ */`, then substitutes
`{{CARTA_MCP_SERVER}}`, producing one self-contained HTML. `{{FIRM}}` is a **runtime**
placeholder the artifact fills from `list_contexts` — leave it alone.

## Versioning — bump this skill's entry when you change the artifact

A deployed artifact is a **frozen copy**. Nothing updates it in place, and the sandbox
sets `connect-src 'none'` so it cannot fetch its own release metadata. The only way an
existing user learns a newer build exists is the update banner, which compares the
version baked in at build time against the one carta-mcp reads from the published
`carta/plugins` tree (`plugin:get:version`, called through the `fetch` tool the artifact
already has — no `capabilities.mcp` change needed).

The version lives in the **plugin's** registry, keyed by this skill:

```jsonc
// plugins/carta-investors/.claude-plugin/skill-versions.json
{ "carta-home-build": { "version": "1.0.0", "headline": "…" } }
```

It sits there rather than beside the skill because carta-mcp reads it from the published
mirror, and a skill that has not opted into publishing never reaches that mirror —
whereas `.claude-plugin/` is plugin-level metadata and is always published.

The registry entry is the **only** place this number lives. This skill's frontmatter
carries no `version:` on purpose: nothing cross-checks the two, so a second copy just
drifts silently every time the artifact ships. `validate-skill-frontmatter.py` warns
about the absence — that warning is expected here, and re-adding the field to silence it
would reintroduce the drift.

**This is not the plugin's own version.** `carta-investors` publishes several releases a
day across ~30 skills; the banner is keyed to this skill's number so it fires only when
*this artifact* changed.

So: **change anything under `resources/`, bump this skill's entry in the same PR.** CI
enforces it (`.forgejo/scripts/validate-artifact-version-bump.py`).

| Bump | When | User sees |
|------|------|-----------|
| **patch** | **the default** — copy tweak, style nudge, refactor, bug fix | nothing |
| **minor** | new card, new data, changed behaviour a user would want to know about | banner |
| **major** | rebuild genuinely required | banner |

**Start at patch and stay there unless you can name what the user gains.** A banner
interrupts every fund CFO running Carta Home, and one raised for a change they cannot
see teaches them to dismiss the next one unread — including the one that mattered. If
you cannot write a headline a customer would care about, that is the signal: ship patch.

Escalating is therefore a deliberate act with a cost attached: minor and major demand a
fresh, non-empty `headline`, and CI rejects the bump without one. The headline *is* the
justification — there is no separate reason field here, because the sentence proving the
bump was worth it is the same sentence the user reads.

`headline` is one line describing what changed, shown in the banner — it is the only
release-comms surface this artifact has, so write it for the fund CFO reading it, not
for the changelog. CI rejects a minor/major bump whose headline is empty or still
describes the previous release.

Two things that follow from the published tree being the source of truth:

- The banner appears only once the change is **published to `carta/plugins`**, not when
  it merges here.
- Internal builds run **ahead** of published, so you cannot dogfood the banner from a
  local build — it correctly stays silent when your version is newer. To see it, stub
  the command's response or temporarily lower your local entry.

## Analytics — currently inert, by platform constraint

Keep calling `trackHome(action, elementId)` on new interactive elements (top of the
handler), IDs as `CartaHome.<Area>.<Specific>` (e.g. `CartaHome.Tour.Start`) — skip sort
clicks, keystrokes, dropdown changes. The calls are harmless and cost nothing.

**No event currently reaches Snowplow, and rebuilding the tracker will not change that.**
The runtime CSP is `connect-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com`,
so the collector host is unreachable from the artifact — the browser blocks the request
before the tracker's transport matters. Restoring analytics means routing events through an
MCP tool call (which goes over the runtime bridge, not the network, and so is not
CSP-limited), not fixing the bundle.

## Deploy steps

### Step 0: Checks before building

Run both checks before building, and stay quiet about them when they pass:

1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/gate-has-artifact-tool.md` — can this session publish at all?
2. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/gate-carta-connector-name.md` — the connector name the page will call.

Both sit in the **plugin's** `references/` directory — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/`,
alongside the other plugin-wide references. They are *not* under this skill's own
`references/`. Read them by that exact path; don't search for them.

This is a live artifact: the rendered HTML calls Carta at runtime through `claude.use("mcp")`, so it needs both.

**Connector check — run it before publishing, and stay quiet when it passes.** Call `welcome`, then `get_current_user`, using *your own* prefixed tool names (`mcp__<prefix>__welcome`). `welcome` confirms the connector actually answers — being listed is registry state, not proof — and publishing without one observed call earns the platform's "published against an unobserved interface" warning. `get_current_user` is not a second check; this skill needs its payload (see below). If either call errors, tell the user Carta isn't responding and stop — do not publish. If both succeed, say nothing about them and get on with the build.

Keep `get_current_user`'s response: Step 3 grants that tool, and the Skill Directory's entitlement gate reads `has_tactyc` / `has_active_manco` from the same payload at runtime.

### Step 1: Build the self-contained artifact (no need to read any HTML)

Run the build script — it assembles CSS + config + app into one file and substitutes the
server id. The script lives in **this skill's own `scripts/` directory**.

> **Path — do NOT rely on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in bash.** In the Cowork sandbox that env
> var is empty, so `uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/…"` resolves to a broken path. Use the
> **base directory reported for this skill when it loaded** (it ends in
> `/skills/carta-home-build`) as `<SKILL_DIR>`. If you don't have it, resolve it once with a
> scoped `find` (NOT `find /`):
> ```
> SKILL_DIR="$(dirname "$(dirname "$(find /sessions "$HOME" -type f -path '*/carta-home-build/scripts/build_artifact.py' 2>/dev/null | head -1)")")"
> ```

```
uv run "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/build_artifact.py" \
  --mcp-server "<CARTA_MCP_SERVER>" \
  --out <outputs-directory>/carta-home-updated.html
```

`<SKILL_DIR>` is this skill's base directory — e.g. in Cowork
`/sessions/<name>/mnt/.remote-plugins/plugin_<id>/skills/carta-home-build`, in Claude Code
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/carta-home-build`.

### Step 2: Find an already-published Carta Home

```
Artifact({action: "list", scope: "mine"})
```

Look for an artifact titled **Carta Home**. If one is there, keep its `url` — Step 3
passes it so the page redeploys in place instead of claiming a second URL. If there is
none, omit `url`.

### Step 3: Publish the artifact

One call either way. `action` defaults to `"publish"`, so it is omitted below; `url` is
the only difference between a first publish and a redeploy.

```
Artifact({
  file_path: "<outputs-directory>/carta-home-updated.html",
  url: "<url from Step 2 — omit entirely on a first publish>",
  title: "Carta Home",
  description: "Dashboard home — SOI, Fund Performance, P&L, Balance Sheet, LP Reporting, Valuations, ManCo Actuals, Form ADV, and Skill Directory. Works for any Carta firm.",
  favicon: "🏠",
  label: "Redeployed from skill bundle",
  capabilities: {
    mcp: {
      servers: [
        {
          server: "<CARTA_MCP_SERVER>",
          tools: ["welcome", "list_contexts", "set_context", "fetch", "get_current_user", "mutate", "call_tool"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

> Anything the page calls that is missing from `tools` rejects with `not_in_manifest`.
> `get_current_user` **must** be there or `fetchUserEnrichment()` fails silently — the
> debug log never prints and the Skill Directory falls back to showing all categories.
> `call_tool` carries the Capital Activity reminder sends, and is the gateway dispatcher
> the Plugin news live content cards use to reach
> `marketing__list__content` / `marketing__get__asset_data`
> (`resources/app/live-content.js`); without it those cards fall back to the static
> defaults. The marketing commands only exist on some environments, so a missing command
> degrades gracefully to the static cards.
>
> Keep `favicon` and `title` stable across redeploys — users find the tab by its icon.
> Restate the whole `capabilities` object every time: a non-empty object replaces the
> stored grant, so a tool you leave out is revoked.

### Step 4: Validate

Open the published URL and check that it displays fund data for the active firm without
errors — SOI rows, Fund Performance charts, and the P&L/Balance Sheet cards should all
populate. The first open asks the viewer to consent to the Carta connector; until they
accept, every card shows its no-connector state.

### Step 5: Confirm

Give the user the artifact's URL and tell them it is live. The artifact auto-detects
whichever firm they have active in their Carta MCP context.

## If something fails

- **DWH query timeout** — this happens inside the deployed artifact, not in this build
  session. Ask the user to reopen the artifact and retry; if it still times out, the firm
  may have an unusually large portfolio or there's an underlying DWH issue, so ask the user
  to confirm in their Carta MCP session that the firm resolves correctly before retrying.
- **A card reports `not_in_manifest`** — the publish call carried an incomplete
  `capabilities.mcp` grant. Compare it against the full `tools` list in Step 3 and
  republish with every entry, passing the same `url`.
- **Every card reports `server_not_connected` or `needs_reauth`** — the viewer has no
  callable Carta connector under the name baked in at publish time, or their credentials
  lapsed. Ask them to add or reconnect Carta in Settings → Connectors. If their connector's
  display name differs from the one Step 0 resolved, republish with the right name.
- **Firm context unavailable inside the artifact** — a runtime issue this build session
  cannot query directly. Ask the user to confirm their Carta MCP connector has an active
  firm in context before redeploying.

## Related skills

The artifact's SOI, P&L, and Fund Performance cards surface the same underlying data as
`carta-explore-data` (ad-hoc DWH queries) and `carta-soi` (dedicated SOI artifact). Routing
stays clean because this skill only triggers on explicit build/deploy/redeploy requests for
the Carta Home dashboard as a whole, not on requests for one of those cards in isolation.

## Data sources (for reference)

| Card | DWH Table | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| SOI | `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS` + `FUND_ADMIN.FUNDS` | Joined on FUND_UUID |
| Fund Performance | `FUND_ADMIN.TEMPORAL_FUND_COHORT_BENCHMARKS` | All funds for the firm, ≥ 2021-06-01 |
| P&L | `FUND_ADMIN.STATEMENT_OF_OPS` | Pre-aggregated per-firm; no journal scan |
| Balance Sheet | `FUND_ADMIN.MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` | IS_FIRM_ROLLUP = TRUE, latest month |
| Tear Sheets | `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS` + `FUND_ADMIN.CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` | Company list |
| 409A | `FUND_ADMIN.IRC409A_VALUE` + `FUND_ADMIN.CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` | Latest valuation per company |
| Deal IRR | `FUND_ADMIN.TEMPORAL_DEAL_IRR` | Latest per ISSUER_NAME |
| Valuations | `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS` | Top 5 by MOIC; HAVING COST > 0 to exclude zero-cost rows |
| ManCo Actuals | `FUND_ADMIN.STATEMENT_OF_OPS` | Per-category expense breakdown; top 5 by spend |
| Form ADV AUM | `FUND_ADMIN.FORM_ADV_FUND_DETAIL` (primary) / `FUND_ADMIN.MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` (fallback) | Discretionary + non-discretionary + total; falls back to total NAV if form ADV table unavailable |
| Capital Activity | none — `fa:list:active-capital-activity` + `fa:list:capital-activity-partner` | Active capital calls/distributions + per-partner detail; the row `id`/`fund_uuid` feed the reminder `mutate` call |

## Notes

- `build_artifact.py` produces a complete, self-contained live artifact — CSS + config +
  app + Chart.js inlined, base64-encoded fonts and logo, **no external hosts at all**. The
  runtime CSP allows no external script, style or connect host, so a CDN reference blocks
  silently and whatever needed it never renders. (Assemble via the build script; the source
  `carta-home.css` / `carta-home.app.js` are injected — the template on its own is
  intentionally unstyled.)
- The artifact supports **any Carta firm** — it calls `list_contexts` without a firm_name
  filter and extracts the active firm automatically.
- Skill directory prompts use `{{FIRM}}` internally and are replaced at runtime with the
  detected firm name.
- Publishing with a `url` only works on an artifact the user owns. If the `url` from
  Step 2 was shared with them rather than theirs, drop `url` and publish fresh.
- To change the artifact, edit the relevant source file under `resources/` (see the
  source-layout table above — includes `resources/app/*.js` for features already split out),
  then re-run `build_artifact.py`. Never hand-edit the assembled `carta-home-updated.html`.
