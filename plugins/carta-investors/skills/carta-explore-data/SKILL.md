description: 'PRIMARY and DEFAULT skill for ALL Carta investors data queries — use before any other skill for Carta Web / Fund Admin data. Carta Web / Fund Admin investors data queries against the data warehouse. For investments, portfolio companies, fund data, fund metrics, NAV, TVPI, DPI, IRR, cash flows, balance sheets, cap tables, ownership %, shareholders, 409a valuations, FMV, MOIC, fund holdings, financing rounds, convertible notes, SAFEs. Prefer over carta-soi for data queries (Cowork persistent artifacts); over carta-portfolio-valuations for read-only valuation/MOIC/investment data (that skill runs/updates valuation projects); over carta-lp-dashboard unless asked by name; over carta-consolidating-balance-sheet for single-fund balance sheets. Use instead: carta-co-investors for co-investor / "who else invested" analysis; carta-waterfall-modeling for exit-waterfall / "who gets paid if X exits" modeling; carta-manco for ManCo budgeting, actuals, pacing, sub-account drill-downs, or budget/actuals breakdowns.'

<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>", "surface": "<value>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.
`surface` is the Claude surface you are running in: `"chat"` (claude.ai or the Claude app, i.e. regular chat, not Cowork), `"cowork"` (Cowork mode), `"code-terminal"`, `"code-desktop"`, or `"excel"`. Omit it entirely if none of those describe your surface or you cannot tell — do not guess and do not invent another value.

# Explore Data

Query the Carta data warehouse for investors data — NAV, performance metrics, cash flow statements, balance sheets, portfolio financials, and more.

## When to Use

This is the skill for **Carta Web / Fund Admin** data work — the data warehouse. Note that **Carta Fund Forecasting (formerly Tactyc)** is a separate domain with its own funds and data; when a fund performance question could belong to either system, the `fund-performance.md` semantic layer will automatically check Fund Forecasting first before running DWH queries.

* **Always use** when the user context is set to a `Firm` and the request involves any Carta Web / Fund Admin data query, financial metric, or reporting question
* **Do NOT use** for funds that live in **Carta Fund Forecasting (formerly Tactyc)** — that is a separate domain with its own data; use `carta-fund-forecasting` for performance metrics (TVPI/DPI/IRR/MOIC/NAV/reserves) of those funds. When the fund system is unknown for a performance query, `fund-performance.md` probes Fund Forecasting automatically and redirects if the fund is found there
* **Always use** for portfolio queries, holdings questions, fund breakdowns, or "what is [firm/fund] invested in" phrasing — even though those phrases appear in `carta-soi`'s trigger list; `carta-soi` is for building persistent Cowork artifacts, not answering data questions inline
* **Always use** for read-only valuation data (409a history, FMV, MOIC, investment metrics) — even though "valuations" and "portfolio companies" appear in `carta-portfolio-valuations`; that skill is for running and updating valuation projects, not reading data
* Also use when **no context is set** and the user asks an ambiguous investment or data question — this skill will guide them through context setup via `list_contexts` / `set_context`

## Prerequisites

The user must have the Carta MCP server connected. If this is the first query in the session:

1. Call `list_contexts` to see which firms are accessible
2. Call `set_context` with the target `firm_id` if needed
3. For **cap table queries** — confirm the corporation ID before running. If the user names a portfolio company, resolve its `CORPORATION_ID` from `CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` first (see Step 2 table below)

> **Tool priority (firm context):** `fa:*` MCP commands → `dwh__execute__question` → semantic-layer SQL (Steps 2–4) → raw `dwh__execute__query`. Never call `cap_table:*` or `cap_table_chart` in firm context — those require a direct tenant role unavailable to investor-portal portcos; use the DWH queries in `cap-table.md` instead.

## Step 0 — Fetch portfolio companies (MANDATORY GATE)

**After setting context**, always fetch the list of portfolio companies the user has access to:

```
call_tool({"name": "fa__list__portfolio_companies", "arguments": {}})
```

Required even for specific-company queries — establishes accessible companies and resolves `corporation_id` values needed for cap table queries.

- If the result is empty, tell the user their firm context may not be set correctly and call `list_contexts` to diagnose.
- If the user asked about a specific company, use the result to resolve the exact `corporation_id` for that company before continuing to Step 1.

## Step 1 — Try execute:question (PRIMARY query path)

> **Structural questions ("what tables exist?", "what columns does X have?") skip Steps 1–3 entirely.** Go directly to `dwh__list__tables` (omit `schema` to list all) or `dwh__get__table_schema`. Do not run `execute:question` for schema discovery — it has no visibility into raw table structure and will hallucinate.

Before loading any semantic layer, call the plain-English query interface with the user's question verbatim (or lightly rephrased for clarity):

```
call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__question", "arguments": {"question": "<user's question>"}})
```

**If the call succeeds and returns meaningful rows** → format and present the results using the General Presentation Rules below. Stop here — do not continue to Steps 2–4.

**Fall through to Step 2 when any of the following occur:**
- The tool returns an error or exception
- The result set is empty and the user's question implies data should exist
- The returned columns don't match what the user asked for (e.g. wrong metric, wrong granularity)
- The tool indicates it cannot interpret the question or lacks the required data

Do NOT retry `execute:question` with a rephrased question — fall through immediately.

## Step 2 — Identify the Query Domain

Use this table to pick the right context file before running any query:

| User is asking about                                                                                                                                                                                       | Context file to read                              | Primary table / tool                                                      |

## Step 3 — Load the Context File

Read the matching file from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/carta-explore-data/semantic-layer/<domain>.md`:

The file contains the SQL query, column reference, and presentation rules for that domain. Follow them exactly.

> **Cap table prerequisite check** — before loading `cap-table.md`, verify:
> 1. The MCP context is set to a **firm** (not a fund or LP). Call `list_contexts` if unsure.
> 2. A `CORPORATION_UUID` is available. If the user named a company, resolve it from `CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` — match by name, UUID, or integer ID depending on what the user supplied:
>    ```sql
>    -- CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2.CORPORATION_ID is INTEGER. SUMMARY_CAP_TABLE / FUND_CORPORATION_OWNERSHIP
>    -- match on UUID (TEXT). Pass CORPORATION_UUID — never CORPORATION_ID — to cap-table.md queries.
>    SELECT DISTINCT CORPORATION_ID AS corporation_integer_id, CORPORATION_UUID, CORPORATION_NAME
>    FROM FUND_ADMIN.CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2
>    WHERE LOWER(CORPORATION_NAME) LIKE '%<user-supplied name>%'
>       OR CORPORATION_UUID = '<user-supplied uuid>'
>       OR CORPORATION_ID = <user-supplied integer id>
>    LIMIT 10
>    ```
>    If multiple matches are found, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm which one before continuing.

* IMPORTANT: if a specific semantic layer was not found, check for Saved Questions by running `call_tool({"name": "fa__list__saved_queries", "arguments": {}})` to get a list of existing questions and descriptions saved on the Data Warehouse. Use `call_tool({"name": "fa__get__saved_query", "arguments": {"name": "<query_name>"}})` to retrieve the SQL of a matching saved query, where `<query_name>` is the `name` field returned by `fa__list__saved_queries`.

## Step 4 — Execute the Query

> **MANDATORY pre-query checklist — run for every query, no exceptions:**
>
> 1. **Determine the schema** from the domain routing table in Step 2: if the table is listed with an explicit schema prefix (e.g. `LOAN_OPS.LOAN`), use that schema. Otherwise `FUND_ADMIN` is the default and most common schema.
> 2. **Verify the table exists**: `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", "arguments": {"schema": "<SCHEMA>"}})` — use the schema from step 2. If the target table does not appear in the result, it does not exist — check the wrong→right table name reference in `## SQL Compilation Safety Rules` before continuing. Do **not** query a table that is not listed.
> 3. **Verify column names**: `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", "arguments": {"table_name": "<TABLE>", "schema": "<SCHEMA>"}})` — use the schema from step 2. Confirm every column you plan to SELECT or filter on appears in the schema with its **exact** name. Check the wrong→right column name reference in `## SQL Compilation Safety Rules` if a column is missing.
>
> **Then resolve any remaining uncertainty:**
>
> 1. **Unclear intent — ask immediately.** If the user's request contains a term that doesn't map to any known domain, table, or Carta concept in the Step 2 table, immediately call `AskUserQuestion` with focused options. Do **not** respond in prose first — go straight to `AskUserQuestion`.
> 2. **Ask up to 2 clarifying questions.** If, after checking saved queries (Step 3) and schema inspection, you still cannot identify the right table or domain, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user **at most 2 focused questions** — e.g. fund-level vs company-level, metric type, entity name. After receiving answers, re-run Steps 2–3 before querying.
>
> **Never assume a table or column name.** Every wrong guess produces a Snowflake compilation error visible in production logs.

Use the MCP commands in sequence, substituting `<SCHEMA>` with the schema determined in the checklist above:

1. **Browse tables:** `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", "arguments": {"schema": "<SCHEMA>"}})`
2. **Inspect schema:** `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", "arguments": {"table_name": "<TABLE>", "schema": "<SCHEMA>"}})`
3. **Run the query:** `call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__query", "arguments": {"sql": "..."}})`

**Output format:** Present results as a markdown table. Use fund or company names as row headers — never raw UUIDs. Currency values use `$X,XXX` format with commas; percentages use `X.XX%`. Bold totals and summary rows.

## General Query Rules

- **Always include LIMIT** — default `LIMIT 200`; use 50–500 for aggregations
- **Only SELECT** — no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL
- **Single SELECT only — no UNION / UNION ALL, no SHOW commands** — the tool enforces one SELECT at a time; `SHOW TABLES LIKE '%...'` and other `SHOW *` commands also return `Only a single SELECT statement is allowed`. Use `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", ...})` for table discovery and run separate `call_tool` calls when you need counts from multiple tables.
- **Do not query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`** — it is not supported in this data warehouse and returns a hard `ValueError: Querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA is not allowed`. Use `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", ...})` to list tables and `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", ...})` to inspect columns. These MCP tools are the only valid schema-discovery path.
- **`LATERAL` (including `LATERAL FLATTEN`) is not permitted** — returns `ValueError: Lateral is not permitted in query execution`. To access keys in a VARIANT/ARRAY column, use explicit JSON path notation (e.g. `col:key::STRING`) rather than `LATERAL FLATTEN`.
- **Date fields** — `effective_date` for `JOURNAL_ENTRIES`; `month_end_date` for `MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS`; `investment_date` for `AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS`
- **Deduplication** — for `MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` and `AGGREGATE_FUND_METRICS`, use `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY fund_uuid ORDER BY last_refreshed_at DESC) = 1`
- **ALLOCATIONS has multiple rows per fund** — always `GROUP BY fund_uuid` with `MAX(fund_name)` when using it for fund metadata

## SQL Compilation Safety Rules

- **Always schema-qualify tables**: `FUND_ADMIN.TABLE_NAME` (or `LOAN_OPS.TABLE_NAME` for loans). A bare name defaults to `PUBLIC` where no customer tables exist.
- **Only query schemas visible in `dwh__list__tables`**: never query a schema that does not appear in that tool's output — unrecognized schemas are either internal-only or non-existent and will always fail.
- **`dwh__execute__query` does NOT accept a `schema` argument** — the schema is encoded directly in the SQL as `SCHEMA.TABLE_NAME`. Never pass `"schema"` inside the `arguments` dict.
- **`set_context` takes `firm_id` as a UUID string** — pass the UUID value returned by `list_contexts`, not a bare integer.
- **Use `fund_uuid` (VARCHAR), not `fund_id`** — the integer `fund_id` is internal-only and not available in customer-facing views.
- **Snowflake syntax only**: `LIMIT N` not `FETCH FIRST N ROWS ONLY`; `LIKE`/`RLIKE` not `SIMILAR TO`; `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)` not bare `ROW()`; `DATE_TRUNC` not `ROUND` on dates; UUID values are strings (`fund_uuid = '<uuid>'`).
- **Wrong → right table names** — if the user or context uses any name on the left, use the right instead:

| ❌ Do NOT query | ✅ Use instead |
|---|---|
| `FUND_NAV` / `NAV_HISTORY` | `MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` |
| `FUND_METRICS` / `FUND_PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY` / `FUND_PERFORMANCE_METRICS` / `FUND_PERFORMANCE` | `AGGREGATE_FUND_METRICS` |
| `CAPITAL_CALLS` / `FUND_CAPITAL_CALLS` | `CAPITAL_ACTIVITIES` |
| `INVESTMENTS` (bare) | `AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS` |
| `PORTFOLIO_COMPANIES` | `call_tool({"name": "fa__list__portfolio_companies"})` — not a queryable table |
| `FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS` / `FINANCIALS` / `PROFIT_AND_LOSS` / `KPIS` / `PORTFOLIO_KPIS` | `COMPANY_FINANCIALS` (KPIs) or `JOURNAL_ENTRIES` (P&L) |
| `INVESTORS_PARTNER` | `PARTNER_DATA` |
| `FUNDADMIN_DATASHARE_*` (with full dbt prefix) | Use short name: e.g. `MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` |

- **Wrong column names**: Domain-specific corrections are in each semantic layer file's `⚠️ Common Mistakes` section. Always run `dwh__get__table_schema` to verify column names before querying. Cross-domain shortcuts that frequently produce `invalid identifier` errors:

| ❌ Do NOT use | ✅ Use instead | Table |
|---|---|---|
| `NET_IRR` / `IRR` | `net_lp_irr` (LP net) or `deal_irr` (gross) | `AGGREGATE_FUND_METRICS` |
| `PRICE_PER_SHARE` | `ORIGINAL_ISSUE_PRICE` | `FINANCING_HISTORY` |
| `AMOUNT_RAISED` | `ESTIMATED_CASH_RAISED` or `CALCULATED_CASH_RAISED` | `FINANCING_HISTORY` |
| `HEADQUARTERS_CITY` / `HEADQUARTERS_STATE` / `HEADQUARTERS_COUNTRY` | `CITY` / `STATE` / `COUNTRY` | `CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` |
| `LEGAL_NAME` / `NAME` / `COMPANY_NAME` | `CORPORATION_NAME` | `CORPORATION_BASIC_INFO_V2` |
| `TRANSACTION_DATE` / `POSTING_DATE` / `ENTRY_DATE` | `effective_date` | `JOURNAL_ENTRIES` |
| `OWNERSHIP_PERCENTAGE` / `OWNERSHIP_PCT` | `PERCENTAGE` (TEXT — cast with `TRY_TO_DECIMAL`) | `FUND_CORPORATION_OWNERSHIP` |
| `OUTSTANDING_QUANTITY` | `OUTSTANDING_SHARES` | `SUMMARY_CAP_TABLE` |
| `BOOL_OR(col)` | `BOOLOR_AGG(col)` | *(any table)* — Snowflake has no `BOOL_OR` |
| `SHARE_CLASS_NAME` | `SHARECLASS_NAME` | `FINANCING_HISTORY` — one word, no underscore between SHARE and CLASS |
| `rows` / `ROWS` (as a column alias) | any other alias (e.g. `row_count`, `cnt`) | *(any table)* — `ROWS` is a Snowflake reserved word; using it as a column alias causes `syntax error unexpected 'ROWS'` |

## DWH Tool Invocations — Exact Forms Required

Use `call_tool` with these exact double-underscore names. Any other form (colon syntax, single underscores, direct tool invocations) returns `NotFoundError: Unknown tool`.

| Task | Exact invocation |
|---|---|
| Run SQL | `call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__query", "arguments": {"sql": "SELECT ..."}})` |
| Natural-language question | `call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__question", "arguments": {"question": "..."}})` |
| List tables in a schema | `call_tool({"name": "dwh__list__tables", "arguments": {"schema": "FUND_ADMIN"}})` |
| Get a table's columns | `call_tool({"name": "dwh__get__table_schema", "arguments": {"table_name": "TABLE_NAME", "schema": "FUND_ADMIN"}})` |

- `dwh__execute__query` key is `sql` (not `query`).
- `dwh__execute__question` keys: `question` (required). Do not pass `sql`, `fund_uuid`, `firm_uuid`, `format`, or any other key.
- **JSON keys with spaces in VARIANT columns** — `col:'Key With Spaces'` and `col["Key With Spaces"]` both fail with `SQL compilation error`. For keys containing spaces, use escaped inner quotes: `col:'"Key With Spaces"'::STRING`. This applies to `AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS.TAGS_JSON` and any other VARIANT column with spaced key names.
- **`ORDER BY` with `SELECT DISTINCT`** — columns used in `ORDER BY` must also appear in the `SELECT` list when using `DISTINCT`; otherwise Snowflake raises `is not a valid order by expression`.

## Deep Links

`include_links: true` required when users wants a direct link to the app. It adds a `_links` entry to each row for supported entity UUID columns:

`include_links` adds a `_links` entry to each row for supported entity UUID columns. Supported fields and their requirements:

| Column | Links to | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| `journal_entry_gluuid` | Journal entry page | `fund_uuid` column in result |
| `journal_entry_line_id` | Journal tab | `fund_uuid` column in result |
| `asset_id` | Investments tab | `fund_uuid` column in result |
| `partner_interest_group_id` | Partners tab | `fund_uuid` column in result |
| `entity_link_id` | Portfolio company page | `fund_uuid` or `firm_carta_id` column in result |
| `issuer_entity_link_id` | Portfolio company page | `fund_uuid` or `firm_carta_id` column in result |

**Always include the resolver column(s) in every SELECT** — `_links` is silently empty without them:
- Include `fund_uuid` whenever the result contains `journal_entry_gluuid`, `journal_entry_line_id`, `asset_id`, or `partner_interest_group_id`
- Include `fund_uuid` or `firm_carta_id` whenever the result contains `entity_link_id` or `issuer_entity_link_id`
- Include these columns even when you don't display them to the user

**Using `_links`:** when a row has a `_links` entry, hyperlink the entity's display name (fund name, company name, LP name) to `row["_links"][field]["web_url"]`. Use the value verbatim — never reconstruct or guess URLs.

## General Presentation Rules

Each semantic file's `## Presentation` section is the source of truth for its domain. When a semantic file does not specify, fall back to these defaults:

- **Render results as a markdown table** with clear column headers
- **Use names, never raw UUIDs** as row identifiers — fund name, company name, LP name
- **Currency** — `$X,XXX` with commas; negatives/outflows in parentheses `($X,XXX)`; bold totals `**$X,XXX**`
- **Percentages** — `X.XX%`
- **Multiples** — `X.XXx` (e.g. MOIC, TVPI, DPI)
- **Missing values** — show `—` rather than `0` or `null` to avoid implying a real zero
- **Use Carta voice** — "your fund's NAV", "your portfolio", not "query results"
