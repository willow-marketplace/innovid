# Form ADV — Source Tables, Field Mappings & SQL Queries

---

### Source Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FUND_ADMIN.FUNDS` | Fund metadata: entity type, legal structure, vintage/formation date, investment strategy, fund size, firm |
| `FUND_ADMIN.JOURNAL_ENTRIES` | Balance sheet: cash, cost of investment, unrealized G/L, other assets, borrowings (all account types) |
| `FUND_ADMIN.MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` | Fund-level NAV (LP/GP split), unfunded commitments, cumulative and annual contributions/distributions |
| `FUND_ADMIN.PARTNER_MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` | **Partner-level point-in-time** NAV and active membership per fund at month-end. Use this for any reporting-date investor count or NAV breakdown. |
| `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_FUND_METRICS` | LP and GP investor counts (current snapshot — fallback only) |
| `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS` | Active portfolio companies snapshot (current state). |
| `FUND_ADMIN.AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS_HISTORY` | Point-in-time portfolio holdings — use with `EFFECTIVE_DATE <= reporting_date` for historical Form ADV filings. |
| `FUND_ADMIN.PARTNER_DATA` | Investor demographics (current snapshot): country (US/non-US), entity type, commitment size. Used for classification, not for point-in-time NAV. |

### Key Fields Mapping

| Output Field | Source | Account Type / Column | Form ADV Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cash | JOURNAL_ENTRIES | account_type 1000–1099 | Sched D §7.B.(1): gross assets |
| Cost of Investment | JOURNAL_ENTRIES | account_type 1100 | Sched D §7.B.(1): FMV (cost basis) |
| Unrealized G/L | JOURNAL_ENTRIES | account_type 1101 | Sched D §7.B.(1): FMV (unrealized) |
| Other Assets | JOURNAL_ENTRIES | account_type 1200–1899 | Sched D §7.B.(1): gross assets |
| Total Borrowings | JOURNAL_ENTRIES | account_type 2000–2099 (negated) — debt only | Sched D §7.B.(1): borrowings outstanding |
| Other Liabilities | JOURNAL_ENTRIES | account_type 2100–2999 (negated) | Surfaced for review; not part of borrowings |
| Unfunded Commitments | MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS | GREATEST(commitment − contributions, 0) | Regulatory AUM addback |
| Regulatory AUM | Computed | Gross Assets + Unfunded Commitments | Item 5.D, 5.F |
| Net Asset Value | MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS | ending_total_nav | Sched D §7.B.(1): NAV; Form PF |
| # Beneficial Owners (per fund) | PARTNER_MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS | distinct partner_id at month_end_date | Sched D §7.B.(1) Q.13 |
| # Beneficial Owners (firm) | Query 3 firm_aggregates | distinct partner_id across funds | Item 5.D, 5.H — firm-level distinct LP count |
| % Non-US Persons (firm) | Query 3 firm_aggregates | partner_country bucketed, distinct partner_id | Item 5.H |
| Fund Formation Date | FUNDS | vintage_date | Sched D §7.B.(1) Q.6 |
| Legal Structure | FUNDS | legal_structure | Sched D §7.B.(1) organizational form |
| Fund Type | FUNDS | investment_strategy_code | Sched D §7.B.(1) fund type classification |

### Important: Date Field

Use `effective_date` (accounting date) from `JOURNAL_ENTRIES`. The datashare table already filters to posted, non-deleted entries — **do not** add an additional `posted_date <= reporting_date` filter, as it will exclude valid backdated entries and misalign with the Carta balance sheet.

### Point-in-Time vs. Snapshot — Rule of Thumb

For any filing-date Form ADV value (investor counts, US/non-US %, asset composition, NAV by partner), use a **point-in-time** source filtered to `reporting_date`:

- Partner membership / counts → `PARTNER_MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` at `month_end_date = reporting_date`.
- Per-partner NAV at reporting date → `PARTNER_MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS.ending_total_nav`.
- Portfolio holdings at reporting date → `AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS_HISTORY` with `EFFECTIVE_DATE <= reporting_date` + QUALIFY most-recent-per-position.

`AGGREGATE_INVESTMENTS`, `AGGREGATE_FUND_METRICS`, and `PARTNER_DATA` are **current snapshots** and are only used as fallbacks (e.g. classification fields where point-in-time isn't required) or when a fund has no NAV calc for the reporting month.

### Query 2 — Per-Fund Investor Demographics (US / Non-US Breakdown)

Produces **per-fund** investor counts, US vs. non-US breakdown, and owner-type distribution for Schedule D §7.B.(1) Questions 14–16. Run after Query 1.

> **Point-in-time:** This rewrite uses `PARTNER_MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` to determine which partners were active as of `reporting_date`, instead of the current-snapshot `PARTNER_DATA.is_active` flag. Per-partner NAV is also pulled from PMN (`ending_total_nav`) at reporting date, not from `PARTNER_DATA.total_net_asset_balance` which is current.
>
> **Entity-type buckets are mutually exclusive.** Each LP falls into exactly one bucket (first match wins, in priority order: pension → trust/foundation → individual → other fund → corporate → uncategorized). This prevents the percentages in Schedule D §7.B.(1) Q.16 from summing to >100%.
>
> **Country detection caveat:** `partner_country` is user-entered. Always spot-check before filing. Partners with no country on file are surfaced separately.

### Query 3 — Firm-Level Aggregates (Distinct LP Count, US/Non-US)

Returns **one row** of firm-wide distinct-partner counts and NAV totals for Items 5.D and 5.H. Run after Query 1 and Query 2. The artifact generators must read these values from `firm_aggregates` in the JSON data file rather than summing per-fund counts — same partner committed to multiple funds was being double-counted.

> **Point-in-time:** Same as Query 2 — membership and NAV are pulled from `PARTNER_MONTHLY_NAV_CALCULATIONS` at `reporting_date`.
>
> **Country deduplication:** A partner committed to multiple funds appears once per fund in PMN. For firm-level distinct counts we collapse to one row per `partner_id` using `MAX(partner_country)` (firms generally have consistent country data per partner; if not, the value reviewed should be flagged).
