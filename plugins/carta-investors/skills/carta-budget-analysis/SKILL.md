# Budget vs actuals

Pacing and variance analysis on top of an existing budget. Two
references:

- [`references/pacing-overview.md`](references/pacing-overview.md) — sheet-wide pacing & variance.
- [`references/drill-down-line.md`](references/drill-down-line.md) — month-by-month + top journal entries for one line.

## UX Rules

Audience is an accountant in Excel. Plain English only. Never surface MCP
identifiers, DWH column names, UUIDs, raw JSON, SQL, or step labels.
Currency: `<CCY>X,XXX` positive, `(<CCY>X,XXX)` negative, totals bolded — use the resolved currency symbol, never a bare `$`.
Differences are absolute. Status: ✅ Match | ⚠ Mismatch ($X diff) | ❌ Missing in Carta | ❌ Missing in Client Doc.

**Closing summary link** is a workbook citation (`<citation:Sheet!Range>`) in
Claude for Excel mode, and a `file://` path in Claude Code / Cowork mode.
Chat-only mode produces neither — just the analysis.

**Every numbered choice in this skill — including the closing
next-step menu — MUST be presented via `AskUserQuestion`.** Never
render options as a bare code-fenced markdown list. The
`AskUserQuestion` tool is in `allowed-tools`; use it. Bare-text menus
break the chooser UI in Claude for Excel and force the user to type
the number.

## When to use

- "Compare YTD to budget"
- "How are we pacing this year?"
- "Are we on track?"
- "What's our variance?"
- "Why are we over on Travel?"
- "Drill into Legal Fees"
- "Which months had the biggest spend on X?"

## DO NOT use this skill for

- **Building a new budget** — use `carta-create-budget`.
- **Refreshing actuals on an existing budget** — use `carta-fetch-actuals`.
- **What-if scenarios** ("what if we cut headcount", "model a revenue shock", "preserve $X cash") — use `carta-budget-scenarios`.
- **P&L / income statement requests** — use `carta-consolidating-pnl`.

---

## Execution discipline

Execute all steps silently. Do not narrate tool calls, intermediate results, or status updates. Only speak at explicit decision points: Step 0.5 (if runtime is ambiguous), Step 1 (destination chooser), Step 2 (intent routing), Step 3 (period/parameter gate), Step 6 (approval), and Step 8 (next-step menu).

---

## Entry mode — fresh session vs. chained skill

**Mandatory telemetry beacon — run this before any skip-gate check:** If `<SERVER>` and `<ENTITY_UUID>` are already in context, call `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<ENTITY_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})` as your very first action. Do not skip this even when all data is already available — it records this skill invocation. If either is unknown, it fires in Step 0 below.

Before Step 0, check whether these context variables are already set from an earlier budgeting skill call in the same session:

- `<SERVER>` — connected Carta MCP server prefix
- `<ENTITY_NAME>` and `<ENTITY_UUID>` — the resolved entity
- `<RUNTIME>` — `excel-addin` or `local-file`

**If all four are in context:** skip Steps 0 and 0.5 entirely. Call `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<ENTITY_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})` to re-anchor the session scope and record this skill invocation. Proceed from Step 1 (destination chooser).

**If any is missing** (fresh session or cold invocation): run Steps 0 and 0.5 in order, then continue from Step 1.

Do not ask "which firm?" or "which runtime?" when those are already established from the skill the user just ran.

---

## Step 0 — Carta MCP environment + resolve firm

1. Call `refresh_mcp_connectors`. Filter `servers[]` to `name` matching `Carta` / `Carta (…)` / `carta` with `status: "connected"`. Drop `failed`.
2. For each `connected`, probe all three prefix forms in parallel: `mcp__claude_ai_Carta__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})` , `mcp__carta_production__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})`, and `mcp__carta__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})`. First success = `<SERVER>`.
3. **Don't call any other `mcp__<SERVER>__*` tool before `welcome`** — every other command is gated and will return a reminder.

If no Carta connected, tell the user and stop. If multiple, default to `Carta` (production).

**Resolve firm:** if user named one → `mcp__<SERVER>__list_contexts(firm_name="<entity>", _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})` → disambiguate via `AskUserQuestion` if multiple → `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-budget-analysis"]})`. Do not use `call_tool` for `list_contexts` or `set_context` — call the granular tools directly with `_instrumentation` as shown.

**DWH param-name traps:** `dwh:execute:query` takes `sql:` not `query:`. `dwh:get:table_schema` takes `table_name:` not `table:`. `format` accepts `"ndjson"` / `"markdown"`, not `"csv"`.

If no firm was named, defer to Step 1.

## Step 0.5 — Detect runtime

Set `<RUNTIME>` to `excel-addin` (open workbook references) or `local-file` (user-supplied path). If unclear, ask via `AskUserQuestion`.

## Step 1 — Where to write the analysis

Branches by `<RUNTIME>`.

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `excel-addin`:**

**Empty-workbook shortcut**: if the active workbook has one sheet, `maxRows == 0`, no other tabs (typically a fresh `Book1.xlsx`/`Sheet1`), skip the chooser. Announce the rename in one sentence — *"I'll use the empty workbook you have open and rename `Sheet1` to `Budget vs Actuals`."* — then proceed. (Skip this shortcut if the user asked for chat-only output.) The chooser only exists to protect non-empty state.

> Where should I write the analysis?

- **"Update the open workbook — new tab `Budget vs Actuals`"** (recommended).
- **"Update the open workbook — alongside the existing budget tab"** (adds columns).
- **"Just summarize in chat — don't write to the sheet"**.

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `local-file`:**

> Where should the analysis go?

- **"Add a `Budget vs Actuals` sheet to the same file"** (recommended).
- **"Write a separate `<budget>-vs-actuals.xlsx` file alongside the original"**.
- **"Just summarize in chat — don't write anything"**.

The "chat-only" option matters for the drill-down case where the user
just wants a quick answer. In chat-only mode, skip the read-helper step
in `local-file` mode if no file is open.

## Step 2 — Intent routing

**Call `read_skill` for the matched reference immediately — do not reconstruct the analysis spec from memory:**

| Phrase | Call |
|---|---|
| "compare", "pacing", "on track", "variance", "how are we doing" | `read_skill(file_path="references/pacing-overview.md")` |
| "why are we over on <X>", "drill into <X>", "what drove <X>", "largest entries", "which months", "what's behind" | `read_skill(file_path="references/drill-down-line.md")` |

## Step 3 — Read the budget from the workbook

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `excel-addin`:** use the add-in's read tools.

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `local-file`:**

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/read_workbook.py" \
  "<BUDGET_PATH>" --sheet "<BUDGET_SHEET>"
```

In both modes:

- Identify the budget tab (ask if ambiguous).
- Parse line items, sections, and the budget column(s) — both monthly and annual.
- Identify any existing YTD column so the analysis can fill it rather than duplicate.

## Step 4 — Pull YTD actuals

Use [`references/get-actuals.md`](references/get-actuals.md) as the canonical
source. `<period_start>` = first day of budget year, `<period_end>` = today
(or last completed month — ask).

In parallel, call `read_skill(file_path="references/vendor-actuals.md")` and
run the vendor actuals query with the same period bounds — this loads
`<VENDOR_ACTUALS>` into session context so vendor questions (e.g. "which vendor
is driving the Travel overage?") are answerable for the rest of the session
without a second round-trip.

## Step 5 — Compute pacing metrics

For each line:

- `actual_ytd` = sum of monthly actuals to date.
- `budget_ytd` = sum of monthly budget through same period.
- `% of annual consumed` = `actual_ytd / annual_budget`.
- `% of year elapsed` = `months_elapsed / 12` — single source of
  truth, used in both the SKILL.md and `pacing-overview.md`.
- `projected run-rate` = `actual_ytd / months_elapsed * 12`.
- `pacing flag` =
  - `OK` if within ±10% of expected pace,
  - `Over` if >10% above pace,
  - `Under` if >10% below pace,
  - `New activity, no budget` if `actual_ytd > 0` and `annual_budget = 0`.

## Step 6 — Pre-build review (approval gate, only if writing cells)

Render two preview tables — overview (≤6 cols) and pacing detail. Splitting keeps each table scannable; squeezing 9 columns into one breaks the chooser UI in Claude for Excel.

**Overview:**

| Section | Line Item | Annual Budget | YTD Actual | % Consumed | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Pacing detail** (one row per flagged line — drop the OK rows):

| Line Item | YTD Budget | Variance | Run-Rate | Projected Year-End |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Output the preview tables above as a normal conversation message. Then call `AskUserQuestion` immediately after — **the `question` field must be a single short sentence; never include preview content inside it.**

- `question`: `"Approve writing this analysis?"`
- `header`: `"Approval"`
- `multiSelect`: `false`
- `options`:
  1. **Approve and write the analysis** ← recommended (`description`: `"Writes the pacing analysis to a new tab."`)
  2. **Edit — change the period end, scope, or threshold**
  3. **Cancel**

The `← recommended` marker goes inside the `description` field of option 1, not as a suffix on the `label`.

Wait for OK before writing. Skipped entirely in chat-only mode.

**Hard rule: no workbook-write tool (Excel-add-in cell write, `execute_office_js` that mutates state, `write_workbook.py`, or any equivalent) runs before this gate's `AskUserQuestion` returns the user's explicit "Approve and write" choice.** If you catch yourself about to call a workbook-write tool without that approval recorded, stop and run this gate first.

## Step 7 — Write and brand the tabs (skipped in chat-only mode)

### Approval-recorded check (run FIRST, before any write tool)

Before calling `execute_office_js` with state-mutating code, `setValues`, `write_workbook.py`, or any other workbook-write tool, look back at your tool history. Find the most recent `AskUserQuestion` you sent. Does its answer literally include `"Approve and write the analysis"`? If NO, Step 6 did not pass — send the Step 6 approval menu now and wait for the explicit answer.

**Do not interpret upstream answers as approval.** A period-end answer from Step 1, a destination answer, or any prior `AskUserQuestion` whose answer is not literally `"Approve and write the analysis"` does NOT clear this gate.

### Step 7 requires AT LEAST three separate `execute_office_js` calls (excel-addin runtime)

The most common failure mode is bundling cell writes + formatting + logo into one `writeSheet(...)` function — the model writes the cells, returns, and forgets the logo. **Do not combine the cell-write call with the brand block in a single office.js block.**

- **Call 1:** cell values, formulas, formatting, conditional formats. One `execute_office_js`. Return.
- **Call 2 (per tab touched):** logo via the verbatim brand block from `branding-and-header.md` (`sheet.shapes.addImage(...)`).
- **Call N (verification, LAST):** load shape names on every tab touched, confirm `CartaLogo` exists.

Returning from Call 1 does NOT finish Step 7. The verification call must appear in your tool history before Step 8 summary.

**Before any write**, call both of these in the same message (parallel reads):

1. `read_skill(file_path="references/branding-and-header.md")` — 4-row metadata band, logo placement, `blobs.getText` asset pattern, cell-comment API.
2. `read_skill(file_path="references/<reference-from-step-2>.md")` — the analysis file matched in Step 2 (`pacing-overview.md` or `drill-down-line.md`).

Do not reconstruct either spec from memory. Both files must be in your context before generating any `execute_office_js` or `write_workbook.py` code. The `branding-and-header.md` file defines the reserved 4-row metadata band (A1 firm / A2 descriptive title like `"Q1 2026 Budget vs Actuals (YTD through March)"` / A3 source / A4 other context), the Carta logo placement (column E, rows 1–3 height), the `blobs.getText("assets/...")` asset-loading pattern for Excel add-in (NOT `Read`), and the cell-comment pattern for any "pacing off plan" flag.

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `excel-addin`:** use the add-in's cell-write tools, then brand the new `Budget vs Actuals` tab (and the underlying Budget tab if a header band was inserted into it).

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `local-file`:**

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/write_workbook.py" --stdin <<'JSON'
{
  "workbook_path": "<DESTINATION>",
  "operations": [ ... ]
}
JSON
```

Include `add_image` (one per new tab) and `set_comment` (one per pacing-flagged row) ops in the same payload as the cell writes.

All numerical columns should be live formulas where possible (so the
user can rerun by editing source data).

### Branding verification (REQUIRED, observable, excel-addin only)

After running the brand block for every tab this skill touched, run this verification as a **separate** `execute_office_js` call before proceeding to Step 8. Substitute `<sample_amount_cell>` with one amount cell from the written range (e.g. `C7`):

```javascript
const tabs = [/* "Budget vs Actuals", ... — substitute the actual tab names touched this run */];
const result = {};
for (const tabName of tabs) {
  const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem(tabName);
  sheet.shapes.load("items/name");
  const cell = sheet.getRange("<sample_amount_cell>");
  cell.load("numberFormat");
  await context.sync();
  result[tabName] = {
    shapes:      sheet.shapes.items.map(s => s.name),
    logoFound:   sheet.shapes.items.some(s => s.name === "CartaLogo"),
    numberFormat: cell.numberFormat[0][0],
    currencyOk:  cell.numberFormat[0][0].includes("[$"),  // locale-specific currency token, e.g. [$$-en-US]
  };
}
return result;
```

Per-tab pass criteria — ALL must be true:
- `logoFound === true` — `CartaLogo` shape exists
- `currencyOk === true` — amount cell format contains `[$` (locale-specific currency token)

**Recovery actions:**
- `logoFound: false` → re-run the verbatim brand block for that tab, then re-verify.
- `currencyOk: false` → re-apply the locale-specific token for the resolved currency — pick the matching line, substitute `<full_amount_range>`, then re-verify:
  - USD: `sheet.getRange("<full_amount_range>").numberFormat = [["[$$-en-US]#,##0.00_);([$$-en-US]#,##0.00);\"-\""]];`
  - EUR: `sheet.getRange("<full_amount_range>").numberFormat = [["[$€-x-euro2]#,##0.00_);([$€-x-euro2]#,##0.00);\"-\""]];`
  - GBP: `sheet.getRange("<full_amount_range>").numberFormat = [["[$£-en-GB]#,##0.00_);([$£-en-GB]#,##0.00);\"-\""]];`
  - CAD: `sheet.getRange("<full_amount_range>").numberFormat = [["[$CA$-en-CA]#,##0.00_);([$CA$-en-CA]#,##0.00);\"-\""]];`

**Do not start Step 8 summary text until every tab passes both criteria.**

**`Range.getImage()` is forbidden here.** The shape name check is the complete, sufficient logo verification. Never output "I cannot visually verify the logo placement" — the shape check IS the verification. If you find yourself reaching for `Range.getImage()`, stop and use the shape check instead.

## Step 8 — Summary + next steps

**Step 8 precondition (DO NOT SKIP, non-chat-only modes).** Before sending the summary text below, scan your tool history. Three anchors MUST be present in that order:

1. An `AskUserQuestion` whose answer included `"Approve and write the analysis"` — Step 6 approval.
2. A `sheet.shapes.addImage(base64)` call for **each** tab the skill touched — Step 7 branding.
3. The branding-verification `execute_office_js` whose result showed `logoFound: true` and `currencyOk: true` on every tab — Step 7 verification.

If any anchor is missing in a write mode (not chat-only), you have skipped a gate. **Do NOT write "Carta logo placed at..." in the summary when no `shapes.addImage` call appears in your tool history.** STOP, go back, run the missing gate, then return here. (Chat-only mode skips all three — the summary IS the deliverable.)

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `excel-addin`:**

> Pacing summary: 12 lines on plan, 3 over (Travel +28%, Legal +14%,
> AI Tooling new activity not budgeted), 2 under (Audit −22% — Q4-loaded,
> expected; Tax Prep −18%). Run-rate forecast lands **<CCY>42,000 over** annual
> operating budget. Full table on [Budget vs Actuals](<citation:Budget vs Actuals!A1:M40>).

**If `<RUNTIME>` is `local-file`:**

> Pacing summary: 12 lines on plan, 3 over, 2 under. Run-rate forecast
> lands **<CCY>42,000 over** annual operating budget. Full table written to
> `Budget vs Actuals` in
> `file:///path/to/<budget-workbook>.xlsx`.

**If chat-only:** the summary IS the deliverable — render the full
pacing table inline. No file or citation.

**The next-step menu MUST be a single `AskUserQuestion` call** with the options below as `options` entries. Never render them as a numbered markdown list, a bulleted list, or inline prose — bare-text menus break the chooser UI in Claude for Excel and force the user to type the number. The `← recommended` marker goes inside the `description` field of one option, not as a suffix on the `label`.

1. **Drill into a specific line item to understand the variance** ← recommended
2. **Model a what-if scenario (cost rebalance, headcount cut)**
3. **Refresh the underlying actuals first, then re-run**
4. **I'm done**

**Call `AskUserQuestion` with these exact parameters:**

- `question`: `"What would you like to do next?"`
- `header`: `"Next step"`
- `multiSelect`: `false`
- `options`: the four `label` + `description` pairs above (place `← recommended` in the `description` field of the recommended option, NOT in the `label`)

**DO NOT** render the menu as inline markdown text, a numbered list, a bulleted list, or closing prose. If your response is about to contain `1. ...`, `2. ...`, `3. ...`, `4. ...` as a list at the end of the summary instead of an `AskUserQuestion` tool call, you have failed this gate — back up and invoke the tool.

Mark option 1 `← recommended` when at least one line is flagged Over.
Mark option 2 `← recommended` when the user's prompt mentions cash or
preserving spend. Mark option 3 if the latest actuals are clearly stale.

**When the user selects an option, immediately invoke the corresponding skill via `Skill('<skill-name>')` BEFORE doing any work.** Do not freelance the output — load the downstream skill's SKILL.md so its gates, layout spec, branding rules, and approval flow apply. Routing:

| Option | Skill to invoke |
|---|---|
| 1 — Drill into a specific line item | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-budget-analysis')` re-entry with the `drill-down-line` reference |
| 2 — Model a what-if scenario | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-budget-scenarios')` |
| 3 — Refresh the underlying actuals | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-fetch-actuals')` |
| 4 — I'm done | No invocation; close cleanly |

### DWH result formatting

Queries > 50 rows: request `format: "ndjson"` and bucket into a blob. Pasting large results triggers `context_snip` and compresses earlier gate checks. Use `"markdown"` only for ≤50-row previews.

## Hard rules

- Reads from DWH; never writes to DWH. Spreadsheet writes go through the approval gate.
- Local-file mode: prefer **adding a sheet** to the same file over a separate file.
- **Two-row header for month-bucketed tables.** Row N = merged month label per Budget/Actual/Var triplet. Row N+1 = sub-headers. Never write both into the same row — subsequent merges destroy sub-headers.
- `range.merge(true)` discards trailing cell values. Insert a new row first; don't merge over an existing sub-header row.
- **Month-label date-serial trap (header rows):** before writing any month or period text label ("Jan 2026", "Q1 2026", etc.) to a header row, apply `numberFormat = [["@"]]` (text format) to the entire header range first, then write the values. Without this, Excel auto-coerces "Jan 2026" → date serial 46023.
- **Currency — derive from the data, never default to USD.** Resolve the workbook's presentation currency before writing (entity properties via `welcome`, or the currency on the budget data); if it can't be resolved, ask the user. State the resolved currency in cell A4: `Amounts in <resolved_currency>`.
- **Currency format:** use a locale-specific currency token — `[$$-en-US]#,##0.00_);([$$-en-US]#,##0.00);"-"` for USD, `[$€-x-euro2]#,##0.00_);([$€-x-euro2]#,##0.00);"-"` for EUR, `[$£-en-GB]#,##0.00_);([$£-en-GB]#,##0.00);"-"` for GBP. Resolve from the data — never default to USD. Do **not** use bare `$`, `_($*`, or quoted `"$"` — Excel strips quotes from stored format strings, leaving a bare `$` that renders as the system currency symbol.
- **Buffer-aware variance basis.** If the budget tab carries an inflation/contingency buffer (an input cell, or a header note like "Budget includes X% buffer"), pacing variances are measured against the buffered figure — state this in the output so favorable variances aren't misread, and offer to pace against the raw (pre-buffer) budget instead.
- **Recalc + column widths:** the last statements in the cell-write `execute_office_js` block, in this order — never a separate call: restore automatic calc → `context.workbook.application.calculate(Excel.CalculationType.full)` → set fixed widths on the text label columns → autofit numeric columns only → `context.sync()`. **Pattern:**
  ```javascript
  context.application.calculationMode = Excel.CalculationMode.automatic;
  context.workbook.application.calculate(Excel.CalculationType.full);
  sheet.getRange("A:A").format.columnWidth = 160;  // Section — fixed, ~22 chars (points, not char-width); fits "Operating Expenses" without clipping
  sheet.getRange("B:B").format.columnWidth = 220;  // Line Item — fixed, ~31 chars; fits long items like "Investment Management Fees"
  sheet.getRange("C:<last_col>").format.autofitColumns();  // numeric columns only
  await context.sync();
  ```
  **Why fixed widths for label columns:** calling `autofitColumns()` on the full range sizes column A to the widest section name (e.g. "Operating Expenses"), making it excessively wide and pushing numeric columns off screen. Always set A and B explicitly, autofit only C onwards. **Recalc before autofit:** without it variance / NOI cells stay at 0 and accounting format shows `-` (####  after autofit). Never autofit a header-only range.
- **Border syntax (Office.js):** `style = "Continuous"` then `weight = "Thin"`. Never `style: "Thin"`.
- **Branding & header standards — follow [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md)** for every tab. Rows 1–4 reserved for metadata band, Carta logo at column E (logo + band col-overrides documented in the reference). Asset access via `blobs.getText("assets/...")` — NOT `Read`. Pacing-flagged rows use cell comments only.

---

## Schema discovery

Source: the Carta DWH journal-entries table. If column names are needed, look up the table via the Carta MCP DWH schema command once at Step 0.

## Error handling

Never auto-retry. Always surface the failure and let the user decide.

- **No Carta MCP connected** → "Open Settings → Connectors, enable Carta, retry."
- **Multiple budget tabs** → ask which to analyze. Don't silently pick.
- **Annual budget column empty** → compute pacing on populated months, flag the gap, ask user to proceed.
- **Drill-down line doesn't match any account** → echo closest 3 matches, ask user to pick.
| Local-file mode: file path is missing or unreadable | Wrong path supplied | Echo the path back and ask for the correct one. |
| Query times out | DWH load | Tell the user it's slow and offer to retry — never auto-retry. |
| Auth / permission error from the MCP | Carta session expired or lacks DWH access | Ask the user to reconnect Carta in Settings → Connectors. |
| Connector shows as connected, but tool calls fail with `McpAuthError` or "tool not available" | The MCP server's tool prefix doesn't match what this skill's `allowed-tools` enumerates. Re-auth is **not** the fix. | Re-run `refresh_mcp_connectors` to confirm which Carta name (`Carta`, `Carta (Sandbox)`, `carta`, etc.) is actually connected, then probe the matching prefix's `welcome` per the Step 0 mapping. **Never tell the user to re-auth without verifying the prefix mismatch first.** |
