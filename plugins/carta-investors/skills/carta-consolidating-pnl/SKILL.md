# Consolidating P&L (detail + executive summary)

Generates a firm-wide consolidating Income Statement for a single month, as
**two linked tabs**:

1. A **detail tab** (`P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>`) matching the
   "P&L- with comments" format, with Month and YTD blocks of Actual /
   Budget / Variance / %.
2. A **Summary P&L** tab at sheet position 0 — a one-page executive
   summary that rolls the detail up into a small set of category lines,
   formula-linked back to the detail.

The data is pulled live from Carta's DWH via the Carta MCP connector —
nothing is embedded in the skill.

This skill runs primarily inside the **Claude for Excel** add-in. The
audience is an accountant working in their workbook, not an engineer
running CLI commands.

## UX Rules

This skill ships as a standalone Claude for Excel skill — the global `carta-skill-ux-rules` SessionStart hook covers currency formatting, status vocabulary, no-UUID display, and plain-English speech. Skill-specific deviations:

- **Citation links** to Excel ranges use the citation form: `[B1:Q72](<citation:P&L - Acme Mar-26!B1:Q72>)`.
- **No environment URLs.** This skill builds Excel output, not Carta web links — the BASE_URL rule from the global hook does not apply.

## Environment detection (Claude for Excel)

This skill does **not** call `carta auth-status` — that command isn't
available inside the Excel add-in. Instead, the active Carta environment
is detected at Gate 0 from the connected MCP server's prefix
(`mcp__claude_ai_Carta_<Env>__fetch`).

## When to use

Trigger on any request shaped like:

- "(Consolidating) P&L for `<FIRM>` for `<MONTH>`" — with or without "with executive summary"
- "P&L for all entities of `<FIRM>`" / "firm-wide income statement"
- Any ask to replicate the "P&L- with comments" + Summary P&L pair for another firm/period

Do **NOT** use this skill for:

- **Single-entity P&L** — use the single-entity P&L workflow (this skill always rolls up across every entity)
- **Balance Sheet** requests — use `carta-consolidating-balance-sheet`
- **Multi-period trend** analysis or **per-entity side-by-side columns** — clarify before building; this skill produces ONE consolidated Actual column per period

## Inputs to collect

Before running, confirm with the user:

1. **Firm name** — must match a firm reachable from the active Carta MCP
   context (resolved fuzzily). Example: `Acme Ventures`.
2. **Month** — format as `YYYY-MM` (e.g. `2026-03` for March 2026). Used
   for both the month block and the YTD-through-month block.

If the user gave both in the request, proceed without re-asking.

---

## Execution discipline

Execute all gates silently. Do not narrate tool calls, intermediate results, or status updates. Only speak at explicit decision points: Gate 4 (pre-build review, build chooser, and budget source), Gate 4b (if budget source requires a file or tab), Gate 5 (output destination if workbook is non-empty), and Gate 9 (post-action menu).

---

## Entry mode — fresh session vs. chained skill

**Mandatory telemetry beacon — run this before any skip-gate check:** If `<SERVER>` and `<FIRM_UUID>` are already in context, call `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})` as your very first action. Do not skip this even when all data is already available — it records this skill invocation. If either is unknown, it fires in Gate 0 below.

Before Gate 0, check whether these context variables are already set from an earlier skill call in the same session (e.g. chained from `carta-consolidating-balance-sheet`):

- `<SERVER>` — connected Carta MCP server prefix
- `<FIRM_NAME>` and `<FIRM_UUID>` — the resolved firm

**If both are in context:** skip Gate 0. Call `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})` to re-anchor the session scope and record this skill invocation, then proceed from Gate 2 (pull period blocks) using the firm already in context and the month from the user's prompt.

**If either is missing** (fresh session or cold invocation): run Gates 0 and 1 in order.

Do not ask "which firm?" when it is already established from the skill the user just ran.

---

## Gate 0: Identify the Carta MCP environment

1. Call `refresh_mcp_connectors`. Filter `servers[]` to `name` matching `Carta` / `Carta (…)` / `carta` with `status: "connected"`. Drop `failed`.
2. For each connected, probe all three prefix forms in parallel: `mcp__claude_ai_Carta__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})` , `mcp__carta_production__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})`, and `mcp__carta__welcome(_instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})`. First success = `<SERVER>`.
3. **Don't call any other `mcp__<SERVER>__*` tool before `welcome`** — every command is gated.

If none connected, list `failed` connectors and stop. If multiple, default to `Carta` (production).

---

## Gate 1: Resolve firm

1. `mcp__<SERVER>__list_contexts(firm_name="<FIRM>", _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})`. Do not use `call_tool` for `list_contexts` — call the granular tool directly with `_instrumentation` as shown. Multiple matches → `AskUserQuestion`. Wait for confirmation.
2. `mcp__<SERVER>__set_context(firm_id=<FIRM_UUID>, _instrumentation={"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]})`. Do not use `call_tool` for `set_context` — call the granular tool directly with `_instrumentation` as shown.

**DWH param-name traps:** `dwh:execute:query` takes `sql:` not `query:`. `dwh:get:table_schema` takes `table_name:` not `table:`. `format` accepts `"ndjson"` / `"markdown"`, not `"csv"`.

**Do NOT call `fa:list:entities`** — firm-wide consolidation aggregates via SQL.

---

## Gate 2: Pull the two period blocks

The schema and sign conventions for the Carta DWH journal-entries
table are documented in `references/schema.md`. Load that file now
and apply its rules.

Compute the period boundaries:

- `month_start` = first day of the month
- `month_end` = last day of the month
- `ytd_start` = `<YYYY>-01-01`

**Single query, both periods at once, summed across all entities under the
firm:**

```sql
SELECT
  ACCOUNT_TYPE,
  ACCOUNT_NAME,
  SUM(CASE WHEN EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<month_start>' AND '<month_end>' THEN AMOUNT ELSE 0 END) AS MONTH_AMT,
  SUM(CASE WHEN EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<ytd_start>'   AND '<month_end>' THEN AMOUNT ELSE 0 END) AS YTD_AMT
FROM <journal_entries_table>
WHERE FIRM_ID = '<firm_uuid>'
  AND ACCOUNT_TYPE >= '4000'
  AND EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<ytd_start>' AND '<month_end>'
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<ytd_start>' AND '<month_end>' THEN AMOUNT ELSE 0 END) <> 0
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

### DWH result formatting

Queries > 50 rows: request `format: "ndjson"`, bucket into a blob. Don't paste large results — triggers `context_snip`. Use `"markdown"` only for ≤50-row previews.

Run via `call_tool({"name": "dwh__execute__query", "arguments": {"sql": "..."}, "_instrumentation": {"plugin": "carta-investors", "skills": ["carta-consolidating-pnl"]}})`.

SELECT-only.

**Critical**: no `FUND_NAME` filter. The GROUP BY on `ACCOUNT_TYPE,
ACCOUNT_NAME` automatically rolls up the same COA account across every
entity into a single row.

**The `HAVING ... <> 0` clause filters out accounts with no YTD actuals.**
That's correct for this stage — but **do not** treat that filtered set as
the final row list for the workbook. If a budget is loaded in Gate 4b,
accounts with budget but zero actuals must still appear as rows (with `-`
or `0` in the Actual columns). The row-set merge happens at the start of
Gate 6 — see "Row set: union of actuals + budget" there.

**Done when:** the period dataset is loaded — Month + YTD amounts for every
P&L account with non-zero YTD activity, aggregated firm-wide.

---

## Gate 2.5: Tag-category discovery (silent probe)

**Always run this gate** — even if the user hasn't asked for tag-view. The result determines whether the Gate 4 build chooser shows the "tag-view" option or hides it. **Silent — no user-facing output.**

Tag-view layout (when chosen at Gate 4) shows **all firm tag categories side by side** under each period band — no "which dimension?" picker. This probe's job is to discover whether the firm has a tag taxonomy in `REPORTING_TAGS_JSON` (or falls back to the flat `REPORTING_TAGS` column).

### Probe 1 — Detect the JSON-vs-flat path

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT_IF(REPORTING_TAGS_JSON IS NOT NULL) AS json_rows,
  COUNT_IF(REPORTING_TAGS IS NOT NULL)      AS flat_rows
FROM <journal_entries_table>
WHERE FIRM_ID = '<firm_uuid>'
  AND EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<ytd_start>' AND '<month_end>'
```

- `json_rows > 0` → **JSON path**. Skip Probe 2 — go directly to Probe 3 (JSON path). Probe 3 returns both category names and cardinality in one query, making a separate category-discovery query redundant.
- `json_rows == 0 AND flat_rows > 0` → **flat path**. Set `<TAG_CATEGORIES> = ["Reporting Tag"]`, `<TAG_PATH> = "flat"`, and continue to Probe 3.
- Both zero → set `<TAG_CATEGORIES> = []`, `<TAG_PATH> = "none"`. Gate 4 will omit the tag-view chooser option.

### Probe 3 — Cardinality per category (when tag-view is on the table)

Only needed if `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` is non-empty. Returns the value count per category for the wide-vs-long decision in Gate 4's dimension picker.

**JSON path:**
```sql
SELECT f.key::TEXT AS category, COUNT(DISTINCT f.value::TEXT) AS n_values
FROM <journal_entries_table>,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(input => REPORTING_TAGS_JSON) f
WHERE FIRM_ID = '<firm_uuid>'
  AND REPORTING_TAGS_JSON IS NOT NULL
  AND EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<ytd_start>' AND '<month_end>'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

**JSON path — after query:** Store `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` as the sorted list of distinct `category` values returned, set `<TAG_PATH> = "json"`, and store `<TAG_CARDINALITY>` as the map of `category → n_values`.

**Flat path:**
```sql
SELECT 'Reporting Tag' AS category, COUNT(DISTINCT REPORTING_TAGS) AS n_values
FROM <journal_entries_table>
WHERE FIRM_ID = '<firm_uuid>'
  AND REPORTING_TAGS IS NOT NULL
  AND EFFECTIVE_DATE BETWEEN '<ytd_start>' AND '<month_end>'
```

**Flat path — after query:** `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` is already set to `["Reporting Tag"]` (from Probe 1). Keep `<TAG_PATH> = "flat"`. Store `<TAG_CARDINALITY>` as `{"Reporting Tag": n_values}`.

**No `AskUserQuestion` here.** This gate only probes. The tag-view choice happens in Gate 4 if the user picks tag-view mode; the wide-vs-long choice (if needed) is asked there too.

**Done when:** `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` and `<TAG_PATH>` are populated.

---

## Gate 3: Classify and assign to sections

Classify by leading digit of `ACCOUNT_TYPE`, per `references/schema.md`:

- `4xxx` → **Revenue** — multiply `MONTH_AMT` and `YTD_AMT` by `-1` for
  positive display (credits stored as negative)
- `5xxx` – `9xxx` → **Expenses** — keep as-is (debits stored as positive)

Then load `references/section-map.md` and apply its keyword table to assign
each expense account to a section. Order matters — **first match wins**.
Sort within each section by `ACCOUNT_TYPE` ascending.

Revenue forms its own section — do NOT run revenue accounts through the
expense map. Revenue subtotal label is `Investment Income`.

`Other` is the catch-all and is always included even if empty.

**Note:** this gate only classifies accounts that have non-zero actuals.
Budget-only accounts (loaded in Gate 4b) are classified separately using
the same rules at the start of Gate 6, then merged into the row set.

**Done when:** every non-zero actuals account is in exactly one section.

---

## Gate 4: Pre-build review

Before touching the user's workbook, show a plain-English preview so the
accountant can sanity-check the build and edit if anything looks off. This
is the pre-flight checkpoint — no Excel changes happen until the user
explicitly confirms.

Present a short, scannable summary:

> **Ready to build the P&L — please review.**
>
> - **Firm:** Acme Ventures
> - **Period:** March 2026 (Month + YTD through Mar 31, 2026)
> - **Scope:** firm-wide consolidating across all entities
> - **Revenue accounts:** 4 (Bank interest, Monitoring income,
>   Flow-through distributions, Unrealized gains)
> - **Expense accounts:** 32, grouped into Human Capital, Contractor
>   Expenses, Occupancy & Office, Professional Services, Travel &
>   Marketing, Technology & Data, Other
> - **Sheets to write:**
>     - `P&L - Acme Mar-26` (detail)
>     - `Summary P&L` (executive summary, first tab)
>
> Note: if you pull from a budget source below, accounts that have a
> budget but no actuals this period will also be added as rows (with
> `$0` actuals) — final count may be slightly higher than the
> totals above.

If any expense accounts landed in `Other`, surface them here:

> ⚠ **3 accounts landed in `Other`:** "Carried interest expense",
> "Foreign exchange", "Misc operating". Confirm or adjust the section
> mapping before building.

Then ask with `AskUserQuestion`. **The available options depend on whether Gate 2.5 found tag data** (i.e. whether `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` is non-empty):

```
1 - Build both tabs (detail + Summary)  ← recommended
2 - Build the detail tab only (no Summary)
3 - Build a tag-view tab — Actuals broken down by all reporting tag categories   ← only if <TAG_CATEGORIES> is non-empty
4 - Change the firm or period
5 - Cancel
```

If `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` is empty, omit option 3 from the chooser entirely.
If the user's prompt explicitly asked for tag/department/cost-center breakdown,
make option 3 the `← recommended` default (and demote option 1 to a plain option).

Handle each branch:

- **1 — Build both tabs** → proceed to the budget source question below.
- **2 — Detail only** → drop the Summary build from the plan; proceed to the budget source question below. Gates 5–6 run only, then Gate 8 verifies the detail alone and omits the Summary tie-out.
- **3 — Tag-view** → record `build_mode = "tag-view"`. **Skip the budget source question entirely** (no Budget/Variance columns in tag-view mode). All firm tag categories from `<TAG_CATEGORIES>` are shown side by side under each period band — no dimension picker. The only follow-up is the wide-vs-long question below, and only if cardinality exceeds the threshold.
- **4 — Change firm or period** → return to Inputs, re-run Gates 1–3, then present this review again.
- **5 — Cancel** → stop the skill cleanly.

### Wide vs long (only when option 3 chosen AND cardinality is high)

Compute the **total column count per period block** as: `sum(n_values for each category in <TAG_CATEGORIES>) + len(<TAG_CATEGORIES>)`. The `+ len(...)` term covers the per-category Total columns. Multiply by 2 for the Month + YTD blocks.

If the combined total exceeds 24, ask via `AskUserQuestion`. The `← recommended` marker depends on which side of the 36-column threshold the run falls on (mirrors the Cardinality guard table in `references/tag-view.md`):

> The tag-view tab would have `<N>` columns across `<C>` categories (`<cat1>`, `<cat2>`, …). With that many, should I build wide (one column per tag per category per period) or long (one row per tag per account)?

| Total tag columns (Month + YTD combined) | Recommended option |
|---|---|
| 25–36 | **Wide — one column per tag** ← recommended |
| > 36 | **Long — one row per tag per account** ← recommended |

Always offer both options regardless of which is recommended — accountants sometimes want the wide layout even past 36 columns if they're going to filter it down in Excel.

Store `<TAG_LAYOUT>` (`wide` | `long`). Default `wide` for ≤ 24 (no question asked).

**Loop until the user picks a build option or cancels.** Never write to
Excel based on inferred intent.

**Do not** surface internal field names (`ACCOUNT_TYPE`, `MONTH_AMT`,
`EFFECTIVE_DATE`) or UUIDs in this review — translate to plain accountant
language.

**Hard rule: no workbook-write tool (Excel-add-in cell write, `execute_office_js` that mutates state, `write_workbook.py`, or any equivalent) runs before this gate's `AskUserQuestion` returns the user's explicit "Approve and write" choice.** If you find yourself about to call a workbook-write tool without that approval recorded, stop and run this gate first. This is not negotiable — silently writing without approval breaks user trust.

### Budget source question (batched with the build chooser)

Ask the build chooser and the budget-source chooser **in a single
`AskUserQuestion` call** with both questions in the `questions` array.
This saves a user round trip — the chooser UI in Claude for Excel
renders two stacked dropdowns from one call. Do NOT make two separate
`AskUserQuestion` calls for these.

If the user picks "Cancel" on question 1, ignore their answer to
question 2 and stop the skill cleanly — the budget-source answer is only
acted on when the build choice is option 1 or 2.

Framing for the second question:

> **Where should I get the Budget figures?**

| # | Option | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pull from Carta** ← recommended | Fetches the ManCo budget live from Carta before building. |
| 2 | **Import from an Excel file** | Asks for a file path; reads the file now. |
| 3 | **Import from another tab in this workbook** | Deferred — picked up in Gate 5 once the workbook is identified. |
| 4 | **Leave Budget blank** | Columns E + N stay empty; Variance / % will render `n/a`. |

Mark `← recommended` based on context — Carta by default; Skip if the
user's prompt explicitly excluded budget (e.g. "build without budget").

Record the budget source choice. Proceed to Gate 4b.

**Done when:** the user has confirmed the build, with their chosen
firm/period locked in, the Summary-tab opt-in/opt-out recorded, and
the budget source choice recorded.

---

## Gate 4b: Fetch budget data

**Skip this gate entirely if `build_mode == "tag-view"`.** Tag-view mode
writes Actuals only — there are no Budget/Variance/% columns to fill. The
Carta `fa:list:budgets` API has no tag dimension, so a per-tag Budget
column would be mathematically misleading (the same budget value
duplicated across every tag column).

Fetch the budget rows now — before any Excel writes — so Gate 6 can
write Budget columns E + N in the same pass as the detail build.

### Option 1 — Pull from Carta

Read [`references/budget-fetch.md`](references/budget-fetch.md) now and
follow Part A (entity picker) + Part B (fetch). Then return here with the
budget rows in the output shape that file documents.

**Narrow the date window in the `fa:list:budgets` call** — pass `start_date = <ytd_start>` and `end_date = <month_end>` (the same YTD window Gate 2 uses). An un-narrowed call returns the full annual budget (~44KB for a typical ManCo), which forces an extra round-trip through `code_execution` and burns context. The YTD-window response is small enough to handle inline.

Source label: `Carta Fund Admin (live) — <ManCo name>`.
Set `scope = "single-entity"`, `entity_name = "<ManCo name>"` — the
single-entity-vs-firm-wide flag in `fill-budget-columns.md` step 1 will
fire because this P&L is firm-wide consolidating.

After the budget rows are loaded, call `context_snip` on the raw `fa:list:budgets` response — you only need the normalized `{gl_code, account_name, month_budget, ytd_budget}` rows downstream.

### Option 2 — Excel file

Ask the user for the budget workbook via `AskUserQuestion`. In Claude for
Excel, the user attaches the file to the conversation; use the add-in's
file-read capability to load it. Don't shell out to Python — this skill
runs entirely inside the Excel add-in.

Parse the loaded workbook for budget rows. Header-detection heuristic:
the first row whose columns include both an account-code-like value
(numeric string) AND a month-like header (`Jan`, `Jan 2026`, `2026-01`)
is the header row. Read data rows beneath it.

Pivot to the same shape `budget-fetch.md` documents at the bottom:
`rows: [{gl_code, account_name, month_budget, ytd_budget}, ...]`.

Source label: `Imported from <filename>`. Set `scope = "single-entity"`
if the file's title block names a single entity; otherwise ask the user
which scope applies.

### Option 3 — Another tab in this workbook

Defer: record `budget_source = "workbook_tab"` and proceed to Gate 5.
Gate 5 will list the open workbook's tabs and ask which one holds the
budget. Then parse and store the rows before Gate 6 writes.

### Option 4 — Skip

No fetch. Set `budget_source = "skip"` and proceed to Gate 5.

**Done when:** budget rows are loaded in memory (or `skip` is recorded)
and `source_label` is set for Gate 8's report.

---

## Gate 5: Decide the output destination

This skill is designed to run inside the **Claude for Excel** add-in.
Before writing anything, decide whether to write into the user's currently
open workbook or to create a new one.

1. **Check for an active workbook.** Use the Excel add-in's
   "active workbook" / "current workbook" tool (whatever name the add-in
   exposes at runtime) to see if there is a workbook open in front of the
   user.
2. **Decide the destination using this matrix** — there are three cases,
   not two. The empty-workbook case is the one most often mishandled:

   | Case | Trigger | Action |
   |---|---|---|
   | **A. No workbook open** | Add-in reports no active workbook | Create a new workbook silently. Tell the user in one sentence that you created `P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>.xlsx` because nothing was open. |
   | **B. Empty workbook open** | One sheet, `maxRows == 0`, no data, no other tabs (e.g. a fresh `Book1.xlsx` / `Sheet1`) | Use it without asking. **Announce the rename** in one sentence before writing: *"I'll use the empty workbook you have open and rename `Sheet1` to `P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>`."* No `AskUserQuestion` is required for the empty case — asking adds friction with no decision to make. |
   | **C. Non-empty workbook open** | Any sheet has data, OR more than one sheet exists | Run the COA label scan described below, then ask. |

   **COA label detection (Case C only).** Before asking the user anything,
   scan every existing tab for matching P&L content. For each tab, read
   non-empty values from column B via `execute_office_js` and compare them
   against the `ACCOUNT_NAME` values in the Gate 3 dataset. A tab is a
   **COA-label match** if ≥ 5 account labels from the current query appear
   in that tab's column B. An **exact-name match** is a tab whose name
   equals the proposed detail-tab name (`P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>`).

   - **If a matching tab is found (exact-name or COA-label):** ask via
     `AskUserQuestion`, naming the matched tab explicitly:
     > *"I found an existing tab `<matched_tab_name>` that appears to
     > contain P&L data for this firm. What would you like to do?"*
     > Options:
     > - **"Update the existing `<matched_tab_name>` tab"** — clear and
     >   rebuild it in place (also rebuild `Summary P&L` if present). ← recommended
     > - **"Create new tabs instead"** — adds `P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>`
     >   (and `Summary P&L`) as new tabs (with a numeric suffix like `(2)`
     >   if those names also already exist; truncate to 31 chars after suffixing).
     > - **"Cancel"** — stop the skill.
     If the user picks **"Update existing tab"**, clear the matched tab's
     used data range before writing:
     ```javascript
     const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<matched_tab_name>");
     sheet.getUsedRange().clear();
     await context.sync();
     ```
     Proceed to Gate 6 using `<matched_tab_name>` as the detail-tab target
     (the sheet already exists — do not call `create_sheet`). Also clear
     and reuse the existing `Summary P&L` tab if it is present; otherwise
     create it fresh.
   - **If no matching tab is found:** ask concretely via `AskUserQuestion`:
     *"You have `<workbook>.xlsx` open with N tabs. May I add
     `P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>` and `Summary P&L` to it?"*
     Options: `Add P&L tabs to this workbook` / `Create a new workbook instead` / `Cancel`.
   - If the user picks "Create new tabs" and the proposed name collides
     with an existing tab, append a numeric suffix (`… Mar-26 (2)`) and
     mention the rename in Gate 8's report. Truncate to Excel's 31-character
     limit after suffixing.

3. **If the user cancels** or denies edit permission for the active
   workbook **and** picks "Cancel": stop the skill cleanly. Don't fall
   back silently to creating a new file.

**The hard rule from Gate 4 still applies** — no workbook-write tool runs
before this gate has either (a) returned an explicit "Yes" answer for case
C, or (b) explicitly announced the rename for case B / new workbook for
case A. Case B removes the dialog but does NOT remove the announcement.

Lock the chosen `<destination workbook>` and the two target sheet names
(`P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>` for the detail, and `Summary P&L` for the
executive summary) and use them through Gates 6, 7, and 8.

**If `budget_source = "workbook_tab"` (deferred from Gate 4b):**
List the open workbook's tabs and use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which
one holds the budget. Same header heuristic as Gate 4b option 2. Parse
and store the rows now, before Gate 6 writes.
Source label: `Imported from tab "<TAB_NAME>" in this workbook`.
Ask the user about scope (`single-entity` vs `firm-wide`).

**Done when:** the destination workbook + both target sheet names are known
and the user has explicitly consented to any edit to a pre-existing
workbook.

---

## Gate 6: Build and brand the detail P&L tab

### Tag-view branch (if `build_mode == "tag-view"`)

**Stop reading the rest of Gate 6 and switch references.** Load
[`references/tag-view.md`](references/tag-view.md) now and follow it
verbatim. That file documents:

- Tab name (`P&L by Reporting Tag - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>`).
- Three-row nested header: row 4 = period band (merged `<MMM-YY>` / `YTD <MMM-YY>`); row 5 = category band (merged per category within each period block); row 6 = tag header (account + tag values + per-category Total per block).
- Category-grouped SQL — JSON path uses `LATERAL FLATTEN` + `CROSS JOIN` to produce one row per (entry × category); flat path uses a synthetic `'Reporting Tag'` category.
- All firm tag categories shown side by side (from `<TAG_CATEGORIES>`) — no dimension picker.
- No Budget / Variance / % columns. No Summary tab. No Gate 7.
- Same metadata band, branding, sign convention, classification, section order, and number formats as the standard build.

**Currency-format verification (REQUIRED, observable, excel-addin only).** After the cell-write call (and before the brand block), run this readback as a **separate** `execute_office_js` call:

```javascript
const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<TAG_VIEW_TAB_NAME>");
const cell = sheet.getRange("<sample_amount_cell>");  // e.g. first data cell, typically C7
cell.load("numberFormat");
await context.sync();
return cell.numberFormat[0][0];
```

The returned string MUST contain a locale-specific currency token matching the resolved fund currency (one of `[$$-en-US]` USD, `[$€-x-euro2]` EUR, `[$£-en-GB]` GBP, `[$CA$-en-CA]` CAD). If it returns `_($* #,##0...`, `$#,##0`, `"$"#,##0`, or anything without a `[$...-...]` locale token, Excel will render currency in the user's local symbol. **Halt, re-apply the format for the resolved currency (`_-<CCY_TOKEN>* #,##0.00_-;_-<CCY_TOKEN>* (#,##0.00);_-<CCY_TOKEN>* "-"??_-;_-@_-`) to the full amount range, and re-verify.** Without this readback in your tool history, Gate 6 is not complete.

After the tag-view tab is built and branded, **skip Gate 7 (no Summary
tab in tag-view mode)** and jump straight to Gate 8 with the tag-view
verification + report variant in `tag-view.md`.

### Standard branch (Build mode = both tabs or detail-only)

The rest of Gate 6 below applies.

### Approval-recorded check (run FIRST, before any write tool)

Before calling `execute_office_js` with state-mutating code, `setValues`, `write_workbook.py`, or any other workbook-write tool, look back at your tool history. Find the most recent `AskUserQuestion` you sent. Does its answer correspond to one of the Gate 4 build-approval choices — **"Build both tabs (detail + Summary)"**, **"Build the detail tab only"**, or **"Build a tag-view tab"**? If NO, Gate 4 did not pass — send the Gate 4 approval menu now and wait for the explicit answer.

**Do not interpret upstream answers as approval.** A budget-source response from the batched chooser, a firm-pick answer, a destination-picker answer from Gate 5, or any prior `AskUserQuestion` whose answer is not literally one of the three build-approval choices listed above does NOT clear this gate.

### Gate 6 requires AT LEAST three separate `execute_office_js` calls (excel-addin runtime)

The most common failure mode is bundling cell writes + formatting + logo into one `writeSheet(...)` function — the model writes the cells, returns, and forgets the logo. **Do not combine the cell-write call with the brand block in a single office.js block.**

- **Call 1:** cell values, formulas, formatting, headers, borders. One `execute_office_js`. Return.
- **Call 2:** logo on the detail tab via the verbatim brand block below.
- **Call 3 (verification, LAST in Gate 6):** load shape names on the detail tab, confirm `CartaLogo` exists.

Returning from Call 1 does NOT finish Gate 6. The verification call must appear in your tool history before Gate 7.

Read `references/formatting.md` AND [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md) now and apply both verbatim. `branding-and-header.md` reserves rows 1–4 for the firm/title/source/context band and places the Carta logo at **column E**, rows 1–3 height. `formatting.md` documents the +4 row shift this introduces — all data row numbers downstream are offset accordingly.

### Brand block — verbatim, paste don't paraphrase (DO NOT SKIP)

The detail tab is not "built" until it carries a `CartaLogo` shape sized to the E1:E3 row band. **Paste the block below verbatim** — never substitute a hardcoded pixel height (e.g. `image.height = 48`), never anchor to a single cell (`getRange("E1")`). Both shortcuts produce a logo the user has to resize and reposition by hand. Substitute only `<TAB_NAME>` = `<DETAIL_TAB_NAME>`:

```javascript
const base64 = blobs.getText("assets/powered_by_carta.b64.txt").trim();

const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<TAB_NAME>");
const shapes = sheet.shapes;
shapes.load("items/name");
await context.sync();

for (const s of shapes.items) {
  if (s.name === "CartaLogo") s.delete();
}
await context.sync();

const rows = sheet.getRange("E1:E3");
rows.load(["left", "top", "height"]);
await context.sync();

const image = sheet.shapes.addImage(base64);
image.name = "CartaLogo";

image.load(["width", "height"]);
await context.sync();
const ratio = image.width / image.height;

image.lockAspectRatio = false;
image.height = rows.height;
image.width  = rows.height * ratio;
image.left   = rows.left;
image.top    = rows.top;
image.lockAspectRatio = true;
await context.sync();
```

**Brand-verification call (REQUIRED, observable).** Run this as a **separate** `execute_office_js` call before proceeding to Gate 7. The check confirms not just that the shape exists but that it was sized to the E1:E3 row band:

```javascript
const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<DETAIL_TAB_NAME>");
sheet.shapes.load("items/name,items/height,items/left");
const rows = sheet.getRange("E1:E3");
rows.load(["height", "left"]);
await context.sync();

const logo = sheet.shapes.items.find(s => s.name === "CartaLogo");
return {
  found:             !!logo,
  heightMatchesBand: logo ? Math.abs(logo.height - rows.height) < 2 : false,
  leftMatchesBand:   logo ? Math.abs(logo.left - rows.left)   < 2 : false,
  shapeHeight:       logo ? logo.height : null,
  rowBandHeight:     rows.height,
};
```

Pass criteria — ALL three must be true: `found`, `heightMatchesBand`, `leftMatchesBand`. If `found` is false, re-run the brand block. If `heightMatchesBand` is false, the block was paraphrased with a pixel literal — delete the shape and re-run the verbatim block above. If `leftMatchesBand` is false, the anchor was a single cell instead of `E1:E3` — same fix. **Do not proceed to Gate 7 until every check passes.** Without this verification in your tool history with all-true checks, Gate 6 branding is not complete.

### Column map (use exactly — do NOT add columns the skill doesn't ask for)


| Col | Month block (rows ≥ 6) | YTD block (mirror) |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | (blank, narrow margin) | — |
| **B** | Account label / section header / subtotal label | — |
| **C** | **5pt spacer** — NO Acct # / GL Code column. Leave empty. | — |
| **D** | Month Actual (raw $) | — |
| **E** | Month Budget | — |
| **F** | (spacer) | — |
| **G** | `=D{row}-E{row}` (Variance) | — |
| **H** | `=IF(E{row}>0, IF(G{row}/E{row}>1000,"1000+%",G{row}/E{row}), "n/a")` | — |
| **I** | (spacer) | — |
| **J** | Month Comments — blank in data rows | — |
| **K** | (spacer) | — |
| **L** | — | (blank) |
| **M** | — | YTD Actual |
| **N** | — | YTD Budget |
| **O** | — | (spacer) |
| **P** | — | `=M{row}-N{row}` |
| **Q** | — | `=IF(N{row}>0, IF(P{row}/N{row}>1000,"1000+%",P{row}/N{row}),"n/a")` |
| **S** | — | YTD Comments — blank |

Header bands: `D4:H4` merged + centered, content = `<MMM-YY>`. `M4:Q4` merged + centered, content = `YTD <MMM-YY>`. Both bold, white-on-black.

Row 5 headers: `D5/M5=Actual`, `E5/N5=Budget`, `G5/P5=Variance`, `H5/Q5=%`. `J4=<MMM-YY> Comments`, `S4=YTD Comments`. Bold, centered.

### Number formats — paste these literal strings, do not paraphrase

Paste these EXACT strings; never rewrite them from memory. Excel number-format strings are easy to mangle.

| Use for | Format string |
|---|---|
| Currency cells (D, E, G, M, N, P + subtotals + totals) | locale token for resolved currency: `[$$-en-US]` USD, `[$€-x-euro2]` EUR, `[$£-en-GB]` GBP, `[$CA$-en-CA]` CAD — pattern: `_-<CCY_TOKEN>* #,##0.00_-;_-<CCY_TOKEN>* (#,##0.00);_-<CCY_TOKEN>* "-"??_-;_-@_-` |
| Variance cells if you want no $ symbol (optional) | `_(* #,##0.00_);_(* (#,##0.00);_(* "-"??_);_(@_)` |
| Percent cells (H, Q) | `0.0%;(0.0%)` (right-aligned) |

**Use the locale-specific token for the resolved currency — never a bare `$` or `"$"`** (resolves to system currency on non-US locales, renders as `R$` on pt-BR, `£` on en-GB). Resolve from fund data: `[$$-en-US]` USD, `[$€-x-euro2]` EUR, `[$£-en-GB]` GBP, `[$CA$-en-CA]` CAD. The negatives section (after the first `;`) MUST keep the parens form `(#,##0.00)` — leading-minus is wrong and will be flagged immediately.

Section order is fixed (Revenue → Human Capital → Contractor → Occupancy →
Professional Services → Travel & Marketing → Technology & Data → Other),
documented in `references/section-map.md`. One blank row between sections.

### Row set: union of actuals + budget (do this BEFORE writing any rows)

The row set is **not** "everything Gate 2 returned". It is the **union**
of (a) accounts with non-zero actuals from Gate 2 and (b) accounts with
non-zero budget from Gate 4b. Dropping budget-only rows forces a full
rebuild the moment the user notices the gap.

If `budget_source != "skip"`:

1. Build an actuals-account set from Gate 2's result: `{(gl_code, account_name)}`.
2. Build a budget-account set from Gate 4b's `budget_rows` where Month or
   YTD budget is non-zero: `{(gl_code, account_name)}`.
3. Compute the union. For each account, record:
   - `month_actual`, `ytd_actual` — from Gate 2's row, or `null` if budget-only
   - `month_budget`, `ytd_budget` — matched from Gate 4b per the GL-code → exact-name → prefix-name precedence in `references/fill-budget-columns.md` step 2
4. Classify every account using the same Gate 3 rules. Budget-only
   accounts go through the same section map.
5. Sort within each section by `ACCOUNT_TYPE` / `gl_code` ascending.

Render every account in the union. For budget-only rows, write `0`
(hardcoded) — NOT a blank — into the Actual columns D and M. A literal
`0` keeps the Variance formula meaningful (`Budget - 0 = Budget gap`)
and signals "we checked, no actuals" rather than "data missing".

If `budget_source == "skip"`: render only the actuals row set from Gate 2.

This union step replaces the post-build "insert missing budget rows"
flow in `fill-budget-columns.md` step 4 for the Carta / file / tab cases.
That step now applies only as a fallback when budget data was unavailable
at Gate 6 time.

### Formatting checklist — must land on the first pass

Every item below must be applied during Gate 6, not patched in afterward. A first build missing any of these triggers a "fix the format" follow-up turn that costs more tokens than getting it right once.

- **Header bands merged and centered** — `D4:H4` (Month) and `M4:Q4`
  (YTD), both merged + horizontally centered.
- **Blue for input, black for formula** — Actual columns D and M and
  Budget columns E and N on every data row use font color `#0000FF`.
  Formulas (G, H, P, Q, subtotals, totals) stay default black.
- **Subtotal rows** (one per section, plus `Total expenses (pre-tax)`
  and `Net Income`) — bold, top thin border on B–H and L–Q.
- **`Total expenses (pre-tax)`** — bold, top **medium** border on B–H
  and L–Q.
- **`Net Income /(loss), pre tax`** — bold, top medium border + bottom
  **double** border on B–H and L–Q. Plus `numFmt="@"` on the column-B
  label so Excel doesn't reinterpret the slash.
- **Account label indent** — column B on every data row gets
  `indentLevel = 1` so section headers stand out.
- **Do NOT freeze panes.** This skill follows the Carta budgeting
  plugin-wide convention of no frozen rows or columns — even on a long
  P&L.
- **Header row 5 bottom border** — thin border under `B5:H5`, `L5:Q5`,
  `J5`, `S5`.

`references/formatting.md` remains the source of truth for cell coordinates and number formats.

### Sheet-write hard rules

- **Two-row header for any month-bucketed table.** This skill's layout
  already uses this pattern (month band on row 4, sub-headers on row 5).
  Never collapse the two into a single row — every subsequent merge will
  destroy the sub-headers.
- **`range.merge(true)` discards values in trailing cells.** Never merge
  cells whose contents you still need. To add a header row above
  existing sub-headers, **insert a new row first**
  (`sheet.getRange("4:4").insert(...)`) and write the merged labels into
  the inserted row — do not merge over a row that already holds sub-headers.
- **Month-label date-serial trap.** Excel auto-coerces strings like
  `"Jan 2026"` or `"Mar-26"` into a date serial (e.g. `46023`), rendering
  as a bare integer unless formatted. Either prefix with apostrophe
  (`"'Mar-26"`) to force text, set `numFmt = "@"` on the cell **before**
  writing the string, or write a real date with
  `numberFormat: "mmm yyyy"` in the same write.

### Other reminders

- Budget match precedence: GL code → exact name → prefix name (per `references/fill-budget-columns.md`). Write matched values into E and N inline during this build.
- Comments columns (J, S) stay blank in data rows.
- Totals are `=SUM(...)`; Variance is `=Actual - Budget`; Net Income is `=Revenue subtotal - Total expenses`.

**Capture cell references before moving on.** Gate 7 needs these — record
them in a small map you can address by name:

- The row number of the **Human Capital subtotal** (`Total Human Capital`)
- The row number of the **Total expenses (pre-tax)** row
- The row number of **each Revenue account**, keyed by `ACCOUNT_NAME`
  (case-insensitive)

These all stay constant between the Month and YTD blocks — the same row
is `D` in Month and `M` in YTD.

**Done when:** the detail sheet exists with both period blocks, all
sections, all subtotals, total expenses, and net income — all driven by
formulas; Budget and Comments columns blank; the row-reference map is
captured.

After the detail tab is written and read-back has confirmed the row map, call `context_snip` on the large `execute_office_js` write payloads from this gate — Gate 7 only needs the row-reference map you captured, not the full row arrays.

---

## Gate 7: Build and brand the Summary P&L tab

**Skip this gate entirely if `build_mode == "tag-view"` or if Gate 4
chose "Build the detail tab only".** Tag-view writes one tab; detail-only
writes one tab. Both jump straight to Gate 8.

Read `references/summary-tab.md` AND [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md) now and apply both verbatim. The Summary tab follows the same 4-row metadata band as the detail tab — rows 1–4 reserved for firm/title/source/context, and the Carta logo at column E anchored to E1 with height = rows 1–3. If `summary-tab.md`'s legacy layout puts the Executive Summary title on B2 with a larger font, keep it on B2 but trim the font down so it still fits inside the 4-row band (or move auxiliary text to B3/B4).

### Brand block — verbatim, paste don't paraphrase (DO NOT SKIP)

The Summary tab is not "built" until it carries a `CartaLogo` shape sized to the E1:E3 row band. **Paste the brand block from Gate 6** (the verbatim version inline there) — never hardcode `image.height = <number>`, never anchor to a single cell. Substitute `<TAB_NAME>` = `<SUMMARY_TAB_NAME>`.

**Brand-verification call (REQUIRED, observable).** Run this as a **separate** `execute_office_js` call before moving to Gate 8. Same shape-geometry check as the detail tab:

```javascript
const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("<SUMMARY_TAB_NAME>");
sheet.shapes.load("items/name,items/height,items/left");
const rows = sheet.getRange("E1:E3");
rows.load(["height", "left"]);
await context.sync();

const logo = sheet.shapes.items.find(s => s.name === "CartaLogo");
return {
  found:             !!logo,
  heightMatchesBand: logo ? Math.abs(logo.height - rows.height) < 2 : false,
  leftMatchesBand:   logo ? Math.abs(logo.left - rows.left)   < 2 : false,
};
```

Pass criteria — `found`, `heightMatchesBand`, `leftMatchesBand` all true. Same fix paths as Gate 6: pixel-literal height → delete shape + re-run verbatim block; single-cell anchor → delete shape + re-run with `getRange("E1:E3")`. If any check fails, re-run before moving to Gate 8.

`summary-tab.md` covers sheet name, position (index 0 — first tab), header rows, the
Month and YTD blocks, the keyword buckets for revenue, the cross-sheet
formula contract back to the detail, number formats, borders, and column
widths.

Use the row-reference map captured at the end of Gate 6 to resolve every
formula on the Summary tab. **Never hardcode a number** — every Actual /
Budget cell on the Summary is a cross-sheet formula pointing at the detail
tab, so refreshing the detail updates the summary automatically.

Reminders from `references/summary-tab.md`:

- Sheet position is index 0 — the Summary appears **before** the detail
  in tab order.
- Quoted sheet names in cross-sheet formulas:
  `='P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>'!D<row>` (single quotes required
  because the tab name contains spaces).
- Empty buckets (Monitoring/Interest, Tax/Other, or Unrealized) get a
  literal `0` so `Investment Income`'s `SUM` still evaluates — and they
  must be surfaced in Gate 8's report.
- Use the same locale-specific currency token here as on the detail tab (`[$$-en-US]` USD, `[$€-x-euro2]` EUR, `[$£-en-GB]` GBP, `[$CA$-en-CA]` CAD) —
  arguably more important on the Summary, which is the tab most likely
  to be screenshotted.

**Done when:** Summary P&L tab exists at position 0, every amount on it
is a formula referencing the detail tab (no hardcoded values), Net Income
reconciles to the detail for both Month and YTD.

---

## Gate 8: Verify and report

**Tag-view branch (if `build_mode == "tag-view"`):** load
[`references/tag-view.md`](references/tag-view.md) §"Gate 8 — verification
+ report (tag-view variant)" and follow that section verbatim. Skip the
rest of this gate — the Summary tie-out, Budget tie-out, and standard
report shape don't apply in tag-view mode.

**Standard branch (both tabs or detail-only):** the rest of Gate 8 applies.

**Gate 8 precondition (DO NOT SKIP).** Before sending the report text below, scan your tool history. Three anchors MUST be present in that order:

1. An `AskUserQuestion` whose answer included `"Approve and write"` (or the Gate 4 "Build it" approval) — approval gate.
2. A `sheet.shapes.addImage(base64)` call for the detail tab — and one for the Summary tab if Gate 4 included Summary — Gate 6/7 branding.
3. The branding-verification `execute_office_js` whose result reported `{found: true, heightMatchesBand: true, leftMatchesBand: true}` for every tab — Gate 6/7 verification. (The verification call now returns a geometry object instead of a shape-name array; matching on `"CartaLogo"` alone is no longer sufficient.)

If any anchor is missing, you have skipped a gate. **Do NOT report tie-out success in the build summary when no `shapes.addImage` call appears in your tool history.** STOP, go back, run the missing gate, then return here.

After writing the detail tab (and the Summary tab, if Gate 4 included it):

1. Read back the `Net Income` row Actual columns on the **detail** (D and
   M). Verify each equals `Revenue subtotal − Total expenses`.
2. If Summary was built: read back the `Net Income` row on the **Summary**
   (C15 for Month, C28 for YTD). Verify each equals the detail's Net
   Income — Month against detail D, YTD against detail M.
3. If `budget_source = "skip"`: confirm Budget (E, N) are empty for
   detail data rows. If budget was filled: verify at least one Budget
   cell in column E is non-empty and no Budget value is written to a
   Comments column (J, S).
4. **Row-set check** (if budget was filled): sample a few budget-only
   accounts from Gate 4b that had zero actuals — they MUST appear as
   rows on the detail tab with `0` in columns D and M and their budget
   value in E and N. If any are missing, you skipped the union step at
   the start of Gate 6 — go back and fix it before reporting tie-out.
5. **Formatting spot-check** — read back a known subtotal row (e.g. the
   Human Capital subtotal) and verify it has: bold font, top thin
   border, and the column-B label is left-aligned (not indented).
   Read back the `Net Income` row and verify it has: bold font, top
   medium border, bottom double border. If either fails, the Gate 6
   formatting checklist didn't land — re-apply before claiming done.

**Report structure:**

Lead with a one-line confirmation, then a **Key tie-outs** block, then
the detail. Status vocabulary: ✅ Match, ⚠ Mismatch ($X diff).

> The P&L is ready in `<workbook>.xlsx` — [Summary P&L](<citation:Summary P&L!B1:F30>) and [P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>](<citation:P&L - <FIRM-SHORT> <MMM-YY>!B1:Q72>).

(**Substitute `<FIRM-SHORT>` and `<MMM-YY>` with the resolved values before rendering the citation link** — leaving the angle-bracket placeholders in the URL produces a broken link.)
>
> **Key tie-outs (Summary ties to detail):** Net Income (Month) + Net Income (YTD) + Investment Income (Month) + Total expenses (Month). Render as the shared 5-column shape: `Line item | Detail | Summary | Difference | Status`, totals bold, `$0` for matches.
>
> Follow with the standard "**N** items checked. **M** matched, **X** mismatched" line, then a one-paragraph build summary: account counts, sections populated, budget source label, "Comments columns are blank — fill them in as you go."

If the Summary tab was skipped (Gate 4 option 2), omit the Summary rows
from the Key tie-outs and note "Summary tab not built (detail only)."

**Flag negative-NOI months in the summary.** If any monthly Net Income figure in the written sheet is negative, surface the count:

> "⚠ N of 12 months show negative NOI in this projection — review the lumpy revenue/expense lines before locking the budget."

Don't bury this in a table. The user needs to see it in prose so they can decide whether to revise before sending the workbook downstream.

**Surface unclassified items** in a follow-up block (always shown, even
when the lists are empty — empty is signal):

> **Accounts in `Other` (review section mapping):**
> - Carried interest expense
> - Foreign exchange
> - Misc operating
>
> **Empty Summary buckets** (no matching revenue accounts — extend the
> keyword list if you want these populated):
> - Tax & Other Distributions
> - Unrealized Gains or (Losses)

After reporting tie-outs and unclassified items, **route into Gate 9**
to run the budget merge (if budget data was pre-fetched) and close with
the post-action menu. Do **not** render a final post-action menu here —
Gate 9 owns the closing menu.

**Done when:** tab(s) exist, Key tie-outs reported with status, unclassified
accounts and empty Summary buckets surfaced.

---

## Gate 9 — Budget tie-out and post-action menu

**Skip the budget tie-out if `build_mode == "tag-view"`** — Gate 4b was
skipped, no Budget data was fetched or written. In tag-view mode, jump
directly to the post-action menu at the end of this gate.

Budget data was fetched in Gate 4b and written during Gate 6. This gate
finalises the budget merge (completing any steps Gate 6 couldn't do
inline) and closes with the post-action menu.

### If `budget_source` is Carta / file / tab (budget data pre-fetched)

Load [`references/fill-budget-columns.md`](references/fill-budget-columns.md)
inline and run the steps that were **not** already handled during Gate 6:

- ~~Insert missing budget rows above the right section subtotal (step 4)~~
  — already handled by Gate 6's row-set union. Run step 4 only as a
  fallback if you discover budget-only rows missing from the detail tab
  (which should not happen if Gate 6 was followed; Gate 8 step 4 catches
  this).
- Rewrite section subtotal `=SUM(...)` ranges (step 5) — only needed if
  step 4 had to insert rows after the fact.
- Fill remaining blanks with `0` so Variance/% resolve (step 6) —
  applies to actuals-only rows where no budget match was found.
- Source note in B3, italic (step 7)
- Tie-out check on Revenue / Total Expense / Net Income vs Budget (step 8)
- Report (step 9)

### If `budget_source = "skip"`

Tell the user in one sentence that Budget columns are blank and Variance
/ % will render `n/a` until they fill them in.

### Post-action menu

Surface the closing menu via `AskUserQuestion`:

**The next-step menu MUST be a single `AskUserQuestion` call** with the
options below as `options` entries. Never render them as a numbered
markdown list, a bulleted list, or inline prose — bare-text menus break
the chooser UI in Claude for Excel and force the user to type the
number. The `← recommended` marker goes inside the `description` field
of one option, not as a suffix on the `label`.

1. **Build the Balance Sheet for the same firm and period** ← recommended
2. **Build the P&L for a different period**
3. **Adjust the section mapping for `Other` accounts**
4. **I'm done**

**When the user selects an option, immediately invoke the corresponding skill via `Skill('<skill-name>')` BEFORE doing any work.** Do not freelance the output — load the downstream skill's SKILL.md so its gates, layout spec, branding rules, and approval flow apply. Routing:

| Option | Skill to invoke |
|---|---|
| 1 — Build the Balance Sheet | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-consolidating-balance-sheet')` |
| 2 — Build the P&L for a different period | `Skill('carta-investors:carta-consolidating-pnl')` re-entry with the new period |
| 3 — Adjust the section mapping | Stay in this skill — re-run from Gate 5 with the user's revised mapping |
| 4 — I'm done | No invocation; close cleanly |

**Done when:** Budget tie-out reported (or skip noted), post-action menu
rendered.

## Schema discovery

Source: the Carta DWH journal-entries table. If column names are needed, look up the table via the Carta MCP DWH schema command once at Gate 0.

## Error handling

Never auto-retry. Surface failures, let the user decide.

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| No Carta MCP connected | Connector not enabled in Claude settings | "Open **Settings → Connectors** in Claude, enable Carta, then ask me again." List any `failed` Carta entries. |
| `contexts:list` returns no firm | Firm name spelling mismatch or not in scope | Echo the name back and ask for the correct spelling. Never near-match silently. |
| `contexts:list` returns multiple firms | Common short name matches several firms | Show the candidates via `AskUserQuestion` and let the user pick. |

## Do NOT

- **Don't rename accounts** — `ACCOUNT_NAME` verbatim; section assignment is display-only.
- **Don't fabricate Comments** — J and S stay blank in data rows.
- **Don't hardcode numbers on Summary** — every Actual/Budget cell is a cross-sheet formula.
- **Don't claim success without re-reading both tabs in Gate 8** — tie-out is a read-back.
- **Don't add columns the skill doesn't ask for** (no Acct # / GL Code column — column C is a 5pt spacer).
- **Account label = `account_name` only.** Never `"4160 Management fee income"` or any variation. GL code is internal-only.
- **Do NOT freeze panes** on either tab.
- **Don't skip branding** — Gate 8 must not run until both tabs carry `CartaLogo` on column E. See [`references/branding-and-header.md`](references/branding-and-header.md).
