description: Configure GrowthBook API credentials and the trusted app origin so the other skills can run and link to the UI. Use when the user says "set up growthbook", "configure my api key", "growthbook isn't working", "where do I put my key", or when another skill emits an error pointing here ("GB_API_KEY is not set", "authentication failed", "GB_APP_URL is required"). Writes ~/.config/growthbook/.env with chmod 600 and validates against the live API. For listing flags or running experiments, the domain skills handle that.

# gb-setup

One-skill onboarding for GrowthBook Agent Skills. Walks the user through `GB_API_KEY` plus `GB_API_URL` and `GB_APP_URL` for self-hosted. Validates the credentials and trusted app origin, then writes `~/.config/growthbook/.env` with `chmod 600`.

The API key is a Personal Access Token (PAT) tied to a GrowthBook user, so the API attributes any flags or experiments the write skills create to that user automatically — there's no separate owner identifier to configure.

`gb-call` reads this file when the corresponding environment variables aren't set, so the user gets a one-time config rather than editing their shell rc. Real environment variables always win over the file — useful for CI and one-off overrides.

Resolve the bundled helper for the current client before using it: under the Claude Code plugin it is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gb-call`; under a standalone Agent Skills install it is `scripts/gb-call` relative to this skill directory. Substitute that resolved command for `<gb-call>` below.

## Workflow

1. **Detect current state.** Check what's already configured. Don't ask the user for values they already have unless they want to change them.

   ```bash
   test -f ~/.config/growthbook/.env && echo "exists" || echo "missing"
   ```

   If the file exists, read it with the Read tool, parse the `KEY=value` lines, and surface a masked summary:

   ```
   I see existing config at ~/.config/growthbook/.env:
     GB_API_KEY = gb_pat_****wxyz   (last 4 shown)
     GB_API_URL = (not set — defaults to https://api.growthbook.io)
     GB_APP_URL = (not set — defaults to https://app.growthbook.io because the API URL uses GrowthBook Cloud)

   Want to keep these, update one, or start fresh?
   ```

   Describe an unset `GB_APP_URL` based on the effective API origin: it defaults to `https://app.growthbook.io` when the API origin is GrowthBook Cloud, but is required when a custom self-hosted `GB_API_URL` is configured.

   Also note what's in `process.env` — if the user has shell exports, those will override the file. Surface that ("`GB_API_KEY` is also set in your shell environment; the file value won't be used unless you unset the shell var.")

2. **Collect `GB_API_KEY`** (required). If keeping the existing value, skip. Otherwise, **show the transcript-exposure notice first** so the user can make an informed choice:

   > Before you paste your key: anything you type into this chat may be stored by your agent client and is sent to your configured model provider as part of the conversation. The skill will mask the key in its replies, but the value you paste cannot be masked retroactively. Check your client's storage and retention settings if this is a concern.
   >
   > Recommendation: **generate a fresh PAT for this plugin** rather than reusing your personal admin token. That way you can revoke it independently if anything goes wrong, without affecting your other API access.

   Then ask:

   > Paste a Personal Access Token (PAT) or Secret Key. Get one at:
   > - Cloud: <https://app.growthbook.io/account/personal-access-tokens>
   > - Self-hosted: `https://<your-host>/account/personal-access-tokens`
   >
   > PATs start with `gb_pat_`; Secret Keys with `secret_`. Either works.

   Once captured, never echo the value back in any later step — mask all but the last 4 characters.

3. **Ask about self-hosted** (optional `GB_API_URL` and `GB_APP_URL`).

   > Are you using GrowthBook Cloud (api.growthbook.io) or a self-hosted instance?

   - Cloud → skip, leaving both URLs unset (`gb-call` defaults to `https://api.growthbook.io` for API calls and `https://app.growthbook.io` for UI links).
   - Self-hosted → prompt separately for:
     - The API origin stored as `GB_API_URL` (e.g. `https://api.acme-internal.com`).
     - The user-facing GrowthBook UI origin stored as `GB_APP_URL` (e.g. `https://growthbook.acme-internal.com`).

   Do not derive one origin from the other. Self-hosted deployments may use unrelated hostnames or serve the API and UI from the same origin.

   **Validate each URL's shape** before accepting:

   - Must parse as a URL (i.e. `new URL(value)` does not throw).
   - Scheme must be `https://` (refuse `http://` — auth headers over cleartext leak credentials; refuse `file://`, `data://`, etc.).
   - Hostname must be non-empty.
   - No username or password.
   - **No path, query, or hash** — `new URL(value).pathname` must be `/` or empty, with empty `search` and `hash`. A value like `https://api.acme.com/v1` would silently mis-route requests or links; reject with a message that asks for just the origin.
   - Strip a single trailing slash before storing.

   Refuse any URL that fails these checks and loop back to ask again; don't silently coerce. Silent fix-ups train users to trust that the system "just works" when the value is sometimes wrong in ways the system can't fix.

4. **Validate against the live API.** Set the collected values as ad-hoc env vars and call a lightweight authenticated endpoint:

   ```bash
   GB_API_KEY='<value>' \
   GB_API_URL='<cloud default or self-hosted API origin>' \
   GB_APP_URL='<cloud default or self-hosted app origin>' \
     <gb-call> GET /api/v1/projects
   ```

   Interpret the result:
   - **2xx** → credentials work. Move on.
   - **401 / 403** → "Authentication failed. The API key is invalid, expired, or has been revoked. Generate a fresh one at `<url-from-step-2>` and try again." Loop back to step 2.
   - **404 on a `growthbook.io` host** → "Got a 404 from `api.growthbook.io`. If you're actually on self-hosted, set `GB_API_URL` to your API base URL." Loop back to step 3.
   - **Network error / DNS** → "Couldn't reach `<host>`. Check the URL and your network." Surface the raw error.

   Don't proceed past validation. If the user is stuck, halt and let them debug — don't write a broken config.

   Then verify that the trusted app origin resolves exactly as expected:

   ```bash
   GB_API_URL='<cloud default or self-hosted API origin>' \
   GB_APP_URL='<cloud default or self-hosted app origin>' \
     <gb-call> app-origin
   ```

   The output must equal the expected UI origin with no trailing slash. If it fails, return to step 3.

5. **Write `~/.config/growthbook/.env` — order matters for security.**

   Create the directory and **lock it down first**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/growthbook
   chmod 700 ~/.config/growthbook
   ```

   The directory's `0700` (owner-only) permission is what protects the file from being readable by other users on the system *during* the next step. Writing the file first and then chmod-ing it leaves a window where the file inherits the user's umask (typically `0022` → mode `0644`, world-readable). Locking the directory closes that window — files inside a `0700` directory aren't reachable by other users regardless of file mode.

   Then write with the client's file-writing tool. Format — one `KEY=value` per line, no quoting (our values never contain spaces, `=`, or newlines):

   ```
   GB_API_KEY=<value>
   GB_API_URL=<value or omit line>
   GB_APP_URL=<value or omit line>
   ```

   Then set the file mode as belt-and-suspenders:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.config/growthbook/.env
   ```

   `0600` means owner-read/write only. With the directory at `0700` and the file at `0600`, the secret is unreachable to any other user on the system.

6. **Report.** Tell the user:
   - Where the file is (`~/.config/growthbook/.env`).
   - What's in it (mask the API key — show only last 4).
   - The trusted UI origin that `gb-call app-origin` returns.
   - That env vars take precedence over the file (so CI / one-off overrides keep working).
   - That re-running the **gb-setup** skill updates the file.
   - The next thing they probably want: the **feature-flags** skill (`flag-search` workflow) to see their flags, or the **experiments** skill (`experiment-brainstorm` workflow) to look at past results.

## Guardrails

- **Never echo the API key back in plain text.** Always mask except for the last 4 characters. The skill's output ends up in the user's terminal and transcript.
- **Surface the transcript-exposure risk before the user pastes a key.** The value typed into chat may be stored by the agent client and is sent to the configured model provider; the skill cannot retroactively redact it. Always recommend a freshly-scoped PAT over reusing an admin token. This isn't paranoia — it's the right way to handle a workflow that requires a user to paste a secret into a conversational interface.
- **Revocation guidance is a real fix, not a footnote.** If a key was ever exposed, the only effective remediation is to revoke and rotate it at `<GB_APP_URL>/account/personal-access-tokens` (or the cloud default). Surface this whenever the user expresses concern about an old or shared key.
- **Directory at `0700` before file write; file at `0600` after.** The order matters. The Write tool inherits the user's umask, which on most systems creates files at mode `0644` (world-readable). Locking the *directory* down first means even the brief window between Write and chmod is not reachable by other users. Then chmod the file as defense in depth. Both steps are non-optional; skipping either turns the PAT into a leak.
- **Env vars take precedence over the file per variable.** If a value is set in `process.env`, `gb-call` ignores that variable's file value. Surface this if both are configured so the user understands what's actually in effect.
- **Validate against a real endpoint, not just shape.** A token that "looks right" but doesn't work is worse than no token — the user thinks they're set up. `GET /api/v1/projects` is lightweight, requires auth, and works on every plan tier.
- **No owner identifier to collect.** The PAT is tied to a GrowthBook user, so the write skills (`flag-create`, `experiment-launch`) let the API attribute new flags and experiments to the token's user automatically. Don't prompt for an email or userId during setup.
- **Don't strip leading whitespace from line values, but strip trailing.** A PAT shouldn't have whitespace at all; if the user pasted one with a trailing newline from a clipboard, strip it. Leading whitespace is unusual enough that surfacing rather than silently fixing is safer.
- **Don't write a partial file.** If validation fails, halt without touching `~/.config/growthbook/.env`. The user re-runs setup; we never overwrite a working config with a broken one.
- **Strip trailing slashes from both URLs.** `gb-call` normalizes `GB_APP_URL` too, but storing clean origins avoids inconsistent output and double-slash bugs.
- **Never infer `GB_APP_URL` from `GB_API_URL`.** The `api.` → `app.` convention is not guaranteed for self-hosted deployments. Ask for the app origin explicitly.
- **Don't propose env vars we don't actually use.** Only `GB_API_KEY`, `GB_API_URL`, and `GB_APP_URL`. Anything else is scope creep and will confuse future contributors.

## File format reference

`~/.config/growthbook/.env`:

```
GB_API_KEY=gb_pat_abc123def456
GB_API_URL=https://api.your-self-hosted.com
GB_APP_URL=https://growthbook.your-self-hosted.com
```

Lines starting with `#` are comments. Blank lines are ignored. No quoting; values are taken verbatim from the first `=` to end of line.

## Endpoints used

- `GET /api/v1/projects` — validation only. Lightweight, requires auth, available on every tier.

## Handoffs

- The **feature-flags** skill (`flag-search` workflow) — natural first call after setup completes (no required inputs, exercises the new config).
- The **experiments** skill (`experiment-brainstorm` workflow) — if the org already has stopped experiments, surfaces them immediately.
- Any skill that emits a config-related error points back here.
