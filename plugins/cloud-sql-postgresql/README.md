# Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This repository packages [MCP Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox)'s prebuilt `cloud-sql-postgres` server as a plugin/extension to interact with [Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres) instances. It can be used with various AI agents, including [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), to manage your databases, execute queries, explore schemas, and troubleshoot issues using natural language prompts.

## Why Use Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL?

- **Seamless Workflow:** Integrates seamlessly into your AI agent's environment. No need to constantly switch contexts for common database tasks.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. Explore schemas and query data by describing what you want in plain English.
- **Full Lifecycle Control:** Manage the entire lifecycle of your database, from creating instances to exploring schemas and running queries.
- **Code Generation:** Accelerate development by asking your agent to generate data classes and other code snippets based on your table schemas.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- One of these AI agents installed
  - Antigravity
     - [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v1.6.0** or higher
     - [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v2.0.0** or higher.
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) version **v2.1.94** or higher.
  - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) **v0.117.0** or higher.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — the MCP server runs via `npx`.
- A Google Cloud project with the **Cloud SQL Admin API** enabled.
- Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
- IAM Permissions:
  - Cloud SQL Client (`roles/cloudsql.client`)
  - Cloud SQL Admin (`roles/cloudsql.admin`)

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not configure a specific `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_USER` or `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, the server defaults to using the active local IAM user credentials. You must also add the IAM user to your Cloud SQL instance, see [Creating a database user](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/add-manage-iam-users#creating-a-database-user).

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Please keep these env vars handy during the installation process:

- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_REGION`: The region of your Cloud SQL instance.
- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_INSTANCE`: The ID of your Cloud SQL instance.
- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_USER`: (Optional) The database username. Defaults to the active IAM user.
- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: (Optional) The password for the database user.
- `CLOUD_SQL_POSTGRES_IP_TYPE`: (Optional) Type of the IP address: `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, or `PSC`. Defaults to `PUBLIC`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
> - If your Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance uses private IPs, you must run your agent in the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

### Installation & Usage

To start interacting with your database, install the extension for your preferred AI agent, then launch the agent and use natural language to ask questions or perform tasks.

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases].

<blockquote>
💡 <strong>Tip — Migrating from Gemini CLI?</strong><br>
If you previously installed this extension with <code>gemini extensions install</code>, you can convert it to an Antigravity plugin instead of reinstalling from scratch:
<ul>
  <li><strong>On first launch of Antigravity CLI</strong>, accept the Migration Options prompt to automatically convert your installed Gemini CLI extensions to Antigravity plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Or, from your terminal</strong>, run:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">agy plugin import gemini</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
See <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/gcli-migration">Migrating from Gemini CLI</a> for details on plugins, context files (<code>GEMINI.md</code> / <code>AGENTS.md</code>), and MCP server config differences.

## Installing via a compatible Agent Plugins client

This repository is a valid [Agent Plugins](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec) (v1) plugin. Any [Agent Plugins–compatible client](https://agent-plugins.org/compatible-clients) can install it directly using its own built-in plugin command — no extra tooling required — by pointing at this repository:

```
https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/cloud-sql-postgresql
```

Beyond harnesses covered by the native install above, compatible clients include VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Kiro. See your agent's documentation for its exact install command.

**Set env vars:**
Set your environment vars as described in the [configuration section](#configuration).

## Usage Examples

Interact with Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL using natural language:

- **Provision Infrastructure:**
  - "Create a new Cloud SQL for Postgres instance named 'e-commerce-prod' in the 'my-gcp-project' project."
  - "Create a new user named 'analyst' with read access to all tables."
- **Explore Schemas and Data:**
  - "Show me all tables in the 'orders' database."
  - "What are the columns in the 'products' table?"
  - "How many orders were placed in the last 30 days, and what were the top 5 most purchased items?"
- **Generate Code:**
  - "Generate a Python dataclass to represent the 'customers' table."

## Available Tools

The tools are provided by MCP Toolbox's prebuilt `cloud-sql-postgres` server, grouped into toolsets covering:

- **Admin** - Provision new Cloud SQL instances, create databases and users, clone existing environments, and monitor the progress of long-running operations.
- **Data** - Explore the database structure, discover schema objects like views or stored procedures, and execute custom SQL queries to interact with your data.
- **Health** - Audit database health, identify storage bloat, find invalid indexes, analyze table statistics, and manage maintenance configurations like autovacuum.
- **Lifecycle** - Manage the lifecycle of your instances, including performing backups and restores, checking major version upgrade compatibility, and monitoring overall instance status.
- **Monitor** - Troubleshoot performance bottlenecks, analyze query execution plans, identify resource-heavy processes, and monitor system-level PromQL metrics.
- **Replication** - Monitor replication health, manage sync states between nodes, and audit database roles and security settings to ensure environment integrity.
- **View Config** - Discover and manage PostgreSQL extensions or fine-tune engine-level settings such as memory allocation and server configuration parameters.
- **Vector Assist** - Define, refine, and apply vector search specs, and generate queries against them.

For the full, up-to-date list of tools, see the [`cloud-sql-postgres` prebuilt config](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/blob/main/internal/prebuiltconfigs/tools/cloud-sql-postgres.yaml) in the MCP Toolbox repository.

## Generating Skills Instead

These tools were previously shipped as agent skills. If your agent lacks deferred
tool loading, or you simply prefer skills, the toolbox can regenerate them from the
same prebuilt toolsets.

All eight skills at once, using the script this repository ships:

```bash
VERSION=<toolbox version> ./.github/scripts/generate_skills.sh
```

Use the toolbox version pinned in [`mcp.json`](./mcp.json). The script writes to
`skills/`, adds the license header, and fails if the upstream config gained a
toolset it does not know about.

A single toolset, without the script:

```bash
npx @toolbox-sdk/server@<toolbox version> --prebuilt cloud-sql-postgres skills-generate \
  --name "cloud-sql-postgres-data" \
  --toolset "data" \
  --description "Explore schemas and run SQL against Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL"
```

The generated scripts call the toolbox through `npx`, so no binary download is
needed. See [Generate Agent Skills](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox#generate-agent-skills)
in the MCP Toolbox repository.

## Additional Extensions

Find additional extensions to support your entire software development lifecycle at [github.com/gemini-cli-extensions](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions), including:

- [Generic PostgreSQL extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/postgres)
- [Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Observability extension](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/cloud-sql-postgresql-observability)
- and more!

## Troubleshooting

Use the debug mode of your agent (e.g., `gemini --debug`) to enable debugging.

Common issues:

- "failed to find default credentials: google: could not find default credentials.": Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment. See [Set up Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/external/set-up-adc) for more information.
- "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
- "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn npx ENOENT": Node.js is not installed, or `npx` is not on your `PATH`. Install Node.js, which provides `npx`.
- "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://mcp-toolbox.dev/documentation/introduction/#install-toolbox) for more information.
