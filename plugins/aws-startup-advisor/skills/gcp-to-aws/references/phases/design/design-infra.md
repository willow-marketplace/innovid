# Design Phase: Infrastructure Mapping

> Loaded by `design.md` when `gcp-resource-inventory.json` and `gcp-resource-clusters.json` exist.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Step 0: Validate Inputs

Read `preferences.json`. If missing: **STOP**. Output: "Phase 2 (Clarify) not completed. Run Phase 2 first."

Read `gcp-resource-clusters.json`.

## Step 1: Order Clusters

Sort clusters by `creation_order_depth` (lowest first, representing foundational infrastructure).

## Step 2: Two-Pass Mapping per Cluster

For each cluster, process `primary_resources` first, then `secondary_resources` (as classified during discover phase — see `gcp-resource-clusters.json`).

### Pass 1: Fast-Path Lookup (Direct Mappings table only)

For each PRIMARY resource in the cluster:

1. Extract GCP type (e.g., `google_sql_database_instance`)
2. Look up in `design-refs/fast-path.md` → **Direct Mappings** table (not the Preferred Target table — that applies later in Pass 2).
3. If found, evaluate the row's **Conditions** column:
   - `Always` → conditions met.
   - Conditional rows (e.g., `google_app_engine_application` requires (`compute_model` absent or `"managed_platform"`) **and** `compute` ≠ `"eks"`): read `preferences.json → design_constraints.compute_model.value` and `design_constraints.compute.value`. If the condition is NOT met (e.g., user chose `"container_orchestration"` or `"serverless"`, **or** `compute: "eks"` from Q5 = multi-cloud), treat as **not found** — proceed to Pass 2. Under `compute: "eks"`, the rubric routes App Engine to **EKS** (portability override, same as GKE); the EB fan-out below does **not** run.
4. If found and conditions match: assign AWS service with confidence = **`deterministic`**. Set `human_expertise_required: false` (no Direct Mapping row requires it).
   - **App Engine fan-out (`google_app_engine_application` only; EB path only — skipped when `compute: "eks"` routed App Engine to EKS or when `compute_model` is `"container_orchestration"`/`"serverless"`):** the parent resource carries no workload config — `runtime`, `instance_class`, `env_variables`, and scaling live on the `google_app_engine_standard_app_version` / `google_app_engine_flexible_app_version` resources. Execute these sub-steps in order:

     1. **Locate the version resources.** They do **not** reference the parent by ID (App Engine allows one app per project, so the link is the shared `project`), so they are **not** reliably in the parent's cluster or `serves[]`. Scan the **entire `gcp-resource-inventory.json`** across all clusters for app_version resources — do not rely on cluster membership.
     2. **Attribute them to this parent.** If there is exactly **one** `google_app_engine_application` in the inventory, all app_version resources belong to it. If there are **multiple** parents, match each app_version to the parent with the same `project`; if `project` is absent on the resources (provider-level in Terraform) with multiple parents, you cannot attribute reliably — map each parent to a single EB environment, add a `warnings` entry naming the ambiguity, and skip sub-steps 4–6 for the ambiguous parents.
     3. **If none were found** (billing-only or partial Terraform): emit a single EB environment, detect the platform from app source, note the assumption in `warnings`, and skip the remaining sub-steps.
     4. **Group by `service`.** An app_version with no `service` argument belongs to service `"default"` (App Engine semantics). Multiple versions of the same service (e.g. `v1` and `v2`, both `service = "myapp"`) are **one** service → **one** EB environment. Pick the config-source version per service: prefer the version with `serving_status = "SERVING"`; if several (or none) are SERVING, pick the highest `version_id` by case-insensitive lexical order, and add a `warnings` entry noting the tie-break so the choice is reproducible.
     5. **Emit one mapping per distinct `service`**, all under a single EB application named for the parent. Give each mapping a **unique `gcp_address`** of the form `<parent gcp_address>#<service>` — where `<parent gcp_address>` is the parent's Terraform address (e.g. `google_app_engine_application.example#default`, `google_app_engine_application.example#worker`) — so per-service mappings don't collide; keep `gcp_type: "google_app_engine_application"`. These per-service mappings **replace** the parent's single mapping — do **not** also emit a bare-parent-address mapping (no `#service` suffix); the parent is represented only by its per-service environments, so the output has exactly one resource per App Engine service, not N+1. Derive each field **from that service's own version config** (see `design-refs/elastic-beanstalk.md` Sizing Defaults): `runtime` → EB platform; scaling block (`automatic_scaling` / `basic_scaling` / `manual_scaling`) → EB `environment_type` (multi-instance/autoscaled → LoadBalanced, single/manual-1 → SingleInstance) and **both** `min_instances` and `max_instances` so Generate can emit ASG MinSize/MaxSize. Read the min/max from the correct provider field for the scaling block present: Standard `automatic_scaling.standard_scheduler_settings.{min_instances,max_instances}`; Standard `basic_scaling.max_instances` (min 1); Standard/Flexible `manual_scaling.instances` (min = max = that count); Flexible `automatic_scaling.{min_total_instances,max_total_instances}`. Default max to min when the block declares no maximum. `instance_class` (Standard) or `resources` (Flexible) → `instance_type` (Graviton `t4g.*` default); `env_variables` → carry into `aws_config.env_variables` so Generate can emit the `aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment` settings. Do **not** use Q6 availability for EB sizing — that governs databases only.
     6. **Finalize.** Each emitted per-service mapping keeps `confidence: "deterministic"`, `human_expertise_required: false`, a non-empty `rationale` (e.g. `"Direct Mapping: App Engine service <service> → Elastic Beanstalk environment"`), and records the source `service` in `aws_config`. The `*_app_version` resources themselves are Skip Mappings — **not** emitted as separate output resources (config sources, no standalone cost). This step **owns their `warnings[]` entry**: add one per consumed version naming the version and the EB environment it fed (see `fast-path.md` → Skip Mappings + Secondary Behavior Lookups). Step 3 handles only versions this step did **not** consume, so there is no double-warning.
5. If `gcp_type` is `google_sql_database_instance` with PostgreSQL or MySQL engine: **always proceed to Pass 2** (Cloud SQL is not in Direct Mappings — see `fast-path.md`). Confidence = **`inferred`** after rubric.
6. If not found (or conditions not met): proceed to Pass 2 (confidence will be **`inferred`** after rubric, or **`billing_inferred`** on the billing-only path).

**Definitions:** See the top of `design-refs/fast-path.md` for **`deterministic` vs `inferred` vs `billing_inferred`** and the note that **index.md “Typical AWS target” ≠ deterministic**.

### Pass 2: Rubric-Based Selection

For resources not covered by fast-path:

**0. BigQuery specialist gate (mandatory — before rubric):** If `gcp_type` **starts with** `google_bigquery_` (e.g. `google_bigquery_dataset`, `google_bigquery_table`, `google_bigquery_routine`, `google_bigquery_data_transfer_config`, `google_bigquery_job`, `google_bigquery_ml_*`):

1. **Do not** recommend a specific AWS analytics or warehouse service (Athena, Redshift, Glue, EMR, Lake Formation, or a prescribed “data lake on S3” architecture).
2. Set `aws_service` to **`Deferred — specialist engagement`**, `human_expertise_required` to **`true`**, `confidence` to **`inferred`**, and `aws_config` to include `specialist_engagement` (text: engage **AWS account team** and/or **data analytics migration partner** before choosing any AWS target) and `no_automated_aws_target`: `true`. Set `rubric_applied` to `["BigQuery specialist gate — no automated AWS service target"]`.
3. **Skip** rubric steps 1–6 and the Preferred AWS target check for this resource.

4. Determine service category (via `design-refs/index.md`):
   - `google_compute_instance` → compute
   - `google_cloudfunctions_function` → compute
   - `google_sql_database_instance` → database
   - `google_storage_bucket` → storage
   - `google_compute_network` → networking
   - etc.

   **Catch-all for unknown types**: If resource type not found in `index.md`:
   - Check resource name pattern (e.g., "scheduler" → orchestration, "log" → monitoring, "metric" → monitoring)
   - If pattern match: use that category
   - If no pattern match: **STOP**. Output: "Unknown GCP resource type: [type]. Not in fast-path.md or index.md. Cannot auto-map. Please file an issue with this resource type."

5. Load rubric from corresponding `design-refs/*.md` file (e.g., `compute.md`, `database.md`)

6. Evaluate 6 criteria (1-sentence each):
   - **Eliminators**: Feature incompatibility (hard blocker)
   - **Operational Model**: Managed vs self-hosted fit
   - **User Preference**: From `preferences.json` design_constraints (includes `compute_model`, `kubernetes`, `cost_sensitivity`)
   - **Feature Parity**: GCP feature → AWS feature availability
   - **Cluster Context**: Affinity with other resources in this cluster
   - **Simplicity**: Prefer fewer resources / less config

7. Select best-fit AWS service. Confidence = `inferred`

7b. **Cloud SQL Q6 gate (mandatory — after rubric):** For `google_sql_database_instance` (PostgreSQL or MySQL), read `preferences.json` → `design_constraints.availability` and **enforce**:

| `availability`          | Required `aws_service`                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `single-az`             | `RDS PostgreSQL` or `RDS MySQL` (engine match)                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `multi-az`              | `RDS PostgreSQL` or `RDS MySQL` + `multi_az: true`                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `multi-az-ha`           | `Aurora PostgreSQL` or `Aurora MySQL`                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `multi-region`          | `Aurora PostgreSQL` or `Aurora MySQL` Global Database                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| absent / null / missing | **Do not proceed** — Cloud SQL PostgreSQL/MySQL is present but Q6 was not answered. Return to Clarify to ask Q6 (or apply the documented Q6 default) before assigning RDS/Aurora topology. Do not infer Aurora from the rubric alone. |

**IaC extraction note:** Only `single-az` and `multi-az` can be auto-extracted from Terraform (`ZONAL` / `REGIONAL`). **`multi-az-ha` and `multi-region` are never inferred from IaC** — they require explicit user intent via Q6 (Mission-Critical / Catastrophic). Cloud SQL `REGIONAL` maps to `multi-az` (RDS Multi-AZ), not `multi-az-ha` (Aurora).

If rubric or fast-path would select Aurora when `availability` is `single-az` or `multi-az`, **replace with RDS**. If rubric would select RDS when `availability` is `multi-az-ha` or `multi-region`, **replace with Aurora**. Add `"User Preference: availability=<value>"` to `rubric_applied`. Q12/Q13 must not override this gate.

1. **Set `human_expertise_required`**: If the BigQuery specialist gate applied, already `true`. Otherwise set `false` unless another rubric explicitly requires it. This field is REQUIRED on every resource in the output.

1. **Preferred AWS target check**: **Skip** if `aws_service` is **`Deferred — specialist engagement`**. **Skip Aurora substitution** for Cloud SQL when Q6 availability is `single-az` or `multi-az` (RDS is correct). **Skip EB substitution** for App Engine when `compute_model` is `"container_orchestration"` or `"serverless"` (the eliminator's Fargate/Lambda target is correct — the PaaS row's condition is false, see `fast-path.md` enforcement exemption), **or when `compute` is `"eks"`** (Q5 = multi-cloud — the rubric's EKS target is correct; the PaaS row's `compute` ≠ `"eks"` condition is false, see `fast-path.md` multi-cloud enforcement exemption). Otherwise verify the selected `aws_service` aligns with the Preferred AWS Target Services table in `design-refs/fast-path.md`. If a non-preferred service is selected (e.g., App Runner for containerized workloads), substitute the preferred alternative (e.g., Fargate). Add a note to the rationale: "Preferred target: [alternative] selected for stronger ecosystem integration."

## Step 3: Handle Secondary Resources

For each SECONDARY resource:

0. **App Engine version resources** (`google_app_engine_standard_app_version` / `google_app_engine_flexible_app_version`): these are **Skip Mappings** — config sources for the App Engine → EB mapping with no standalone AWS target (see `fast-path.md`). If the App Engine fan-out (Pass 1 step 4) already consumed this version, it has already logged the `warnings[]` entry — do nothing here. Otherwise (the fan-out did not run — `container_orchestration`/`serverless` path, `compute: "eks"` multi-cloud path, ambiguous attribution, or no parent), skip it now: **do not** emit it to `aws-design.json`, **do not** send it through `index.md`/rubric, and add one `warnings[]` entry for it. Either way it never reaches the Pass 2 unknown-type catch-all — so no path STOPs on it, and each version is warned exactly once.
1. Use `design-refs/index.md` for category
2. Apply fast-path (most secondaries have deterministic mappings)
3. If rubric needed: apply the **BigQuery specialist gate** (Pass 2 step 0) first when `gcp_type` starts with `google_bigquery_`; otherwise apply the same 6-criteria approach as Pass 2

## Step 3.5: Validate AWS Architecture (using awsknowledge)

If `aws_service` is **`Deferred — specialist engagement`**, **do not** validate against concrete AWS analytics SKUs; add a `warnings[]` entry that specialist engagement is required.

**Validation checks** (if awsknowledge available):

For each mapped AWS service, verify:

1. **Regional Availability**: Is the service available in the target region (e.g., `us-east-1`)?
   - Use awsknowledge to check regional support
   - If unavailable: add warning, suggest fallback region

2. **Feature Parity**: Do required features exist in AWS service?
   - Match GCP features from `preferences.json` design_constraints
   - Check AWS feature availability via awsknowledge
   - If feature missing: add warning, suggest alternative service

3. **Service Compatibility**: Are there known issues or constraints?
   - Check best practices and gotchas via awsknowledge
   - Add to warnings if applicable

**If awsknowledge unavailable:**

- Set `validation_status: "skipped"` in output
- Note in summary: "Architecture validation unavailable (non-critical)"
- Continue with design (validation is informational, not blocking)

**If validation succeeds:**

- Set `validation_status: "completed"` in output
- List validated services in summary

## Step 4: Write Design Output

**File 1: `aws-design.json`**

```json
{
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": "compute_instance_us-central1_001",

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [

## Completion Handoff Gate (Fail Closed)

Before returning control to `design.md`, require:

- `aws-design.json` exists and passes the Output Validation Checklist above.

If this gate fails: STOP and output: "design-infra did not produce a valid `aws-design.json`; do not complete Phase 3."

## Present Summary

After writing `aws-design.json`, present a concise summary to the user:

1. Total resources mapped and cluster count
2. Per-cluster table: GCP resource → AWS service (one line each). For how each mapping was chosen, use **plain English** from `design-refs/fast-path.md` → **User-facing vocabulary** — **Standard pairing** (`deterministic`), **Tailored to your setup** (`inferred`), or **Estimated from billing only** (`billing_inferred`). Lead with the bold phrase; include the JSON value in parentheses only if the user is technical.
3. Any warnings (regional fallbacks; call out **Tailored to your setup** rows that deserve extra review)
4. If any resource has **`Deferred — specialist engagement`**: state **prominently** that **no AWS analytics target was chosen**. Direct the user to **their AWS account team and/or a data analytics migration partner**. Do **not** recommend Athena, Redshift, Glue, or EMR in the chat summary.

Keep it under 20 lines. The user can ask for details or re-read `aws-design.json` at any time.
