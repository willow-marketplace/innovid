# Discover Phase: Live Discovery (gcloud CLI)

> Self-contained live-discovery sub-file. Inventories the user's GCP project
> directly through their authenticated `gcloud` CLI — read-only, consent-gated,
> env-var names only. Produces the SAME artifacts as `discover-iac.md`
> (`gcp-resource-inventory.json` + `gcp-resource-clusters.json`, simplified
> clustering mode), so all downstream phases work identically. When IaC discovery
> also ran, merges live findings into the existing inventory and surfaces drift.
> If the user declines consent or `gcloud` is unavailable, exits cleanly with no
> output.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Security Contract (applies to every step)

1. **Exact-command whitelist.** Run ONLY commands that appear in Step 0 (preflight)
   or the Step 2 Capture Command Table. Never any mutating verb (`create`, `update`,
   `delete`, `set`, `add`, `remove`, `deploy`, `apply`, `import`, `patch`), never
   `gcloud auth login` (interactive — hand off to the user), never
   `gcloud auth print-access-token` or `print-identity-token` (prints credentials).
2. **Never capture secret values.** Every capture command uses an explicit
   `--format="json(...)"` field projection. Projections include env var **names**
   but never env var **values**, and never GCE instance `metadata.items` values.
   Additionally, apply `discover-iac.md`'s sensitive-key redaction patterns
   (`password`, `secret`, `api_key`, `access_key`, `private_key`, `client_secret`,
   `token`, `credential`, `auth` — case-insensitive) to any config field before it
   is written into an artifact: replace matched values with `"[REDACTED]"`.
3. **Always explicit scope.** Every command passes `--project="$GCP_PROJECT"`
   explicitly. Never rely on the active gcloud config inside capture commands.
4. **Capture to files, not context.** Redirect stdout to files under
   `$MIGRATION_DIR/live-capture/`. Process any capture file larger than ~100
   resources with a throwaway extraction script (same pattern as `discover.md`'s
   lightweight billing extraction) — do NOT Read large raw captures into context.
5. **Consent first.** No `gcloud` command from the Step 2 table runs before the
   user answers `[A]` in Step 1. Preflight commands in Step 0 are limited to
   version/auth/config checks that touch no project data.

---

## Step 0: Preflight

1. **CLI installed:** run `gcloud --version` (first line only).
   - Missing → tell the user: "The gcloud CLI isn't installed. Install it
     (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and tell me to continue, or skip
     live discovery." Wait. If skipped → exit cleanly.
2. **Project:** run `gcloud config get-value project` (a local config read — no
   credentials needed, which is why this step precedes the auth check).
   - Show the result and ask: "Discover project `[project-id]`? [Y] Yes /
     [N] Use a different project (type its ID)". Set `$GCP_PROJECT` accordingly.
     If the value is empty, ask the user to type the project ID. One project per
     run — for multiple projects, run the migration once per project.
3. **Authenticated:** run `gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE --format="value(account)"`.
   - Empty → do NOT hand off yet: credentials may come from ADC
     (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) or service-account impersonation, which
     `auth list` does not show. Probe read-only with the project just resolved:
     `gcloud projects describe "$GCP_PROJECT" --format="value(projectId)"`.
     Probe succeeds → proceed (record `account: "adc"` in the manifest).
     Probe fails → tell the user: "Your gcloud CLI has no usable credentials.
     Run `gcloud auth login` in your terminal — it needs a browser, so I can't
     run it for you — then tell me to continue." Wait. If declined → exit cleanly.

## Step 1: Consent Gate

Output exactly, then wait for the user's choice:

```
─── Live GCP Discovery (read-only) ───

I can inventory project [$GCP_PROJECT] directly using your
authenticated gcloud CLI. This runs LIST/DESCRIBE commands only:

  ✓ Captured: resource names, types, regions, machine/instance
    sizing, container images, network topology, env var NAMES,
    secret NAMES, and labels.
  ✗ Never captured: env var values, secret values, database
    contents, instance metadata values, access tokens, or source
    code. No command that creates, changes, or deletes anything
    will run.

Output is written to .migration/<run>/live-capture/ (gitignored).

[A] Proceed with live discovery
[B] Skip — use workspace files only
```

- **[A]** → continue to Step 2.
- **[B]** → exit cleanly with no output (record the decline for the orchestrator).

## Step 2: Capture

Create `$MIGRATION_DIR/live-capture/`.

**2a. Fast path — Cloud Asset Inventory (one call, whole project):**

```
gcloud asset search-all-resources --scope="projects/$GCP_PROJECT" \
  --format=json > $MIGRATION_DIR/live-capture/assets.json
```

(`--scope` is the documented scoping flag for asset search — do not rely on the
active project. No `--asset-types` filter on purpose: unfiltered results feed
`live_metadata.unmapped_asset_types`, which tells the user what ELSE lives in
the project; the Step 2 scale guard handles large outputs.)

- Success → record `method: "asset_search"` in the manifest, then run only the
  **enrichment rows** (marked E) of the table below for asset types that were
  found (asset search returns names/types/locations but thin config). The cheap
  networking/secrets/identity lists (rows 8, 9, 11, 12) are E rows precisely so
  edge inference and name inventories keep full fidelity on this path.

  > **Why not `gcloud asset list --content-type=resource` (full metadata, one
  > call)?** Deliberate. Full `resource.data` includes env var VALUES (Cloud
  > Run, Functions) and instance metadata values — writing it to
  > `live-capture/` would put secret material on disk and break this file's
  > "values never captured" contract. Thin search + the projected enrichment
  > rows below keep values out of the captures entirely. The same applies to
  > `search-all-resources --read-mask` with resource data. Do NOT "optimize"
  > this into a full-metadata dump.
- Failure → classify the error, then branch:

  **API not enabled** (stderr matches `SERVICE_DISABLED`, "has not been used",
  "is not enabled", or "API [has not been / is not] enabled" — the common
  startup case; Cloud Asset API is off by default):

  Offer **once** (user-driven enable — never run `gcloud services enable` or
  IAM mutations yourself):

  ```
  ─── Cloud Asset Inventory not enabled ───

  The Cloud Asset API is not enabled on [$GCP_PROJECT]. Enabling it gives a
  fuller inventory in one call (including resources outside the per-service
  list). I will not change your project for you.

  1. Enable the API (pick one):

       gcloud services enable cloudasset.googleapis.com --project="$GCP_PROJECT"

     Or console: APIs & Services → Library → search "Cloud Asset API" → Enable.
     Propagation can take up to a minute.

  2. IAM — your identity also needs Cloud Asset Viewer on the project
     (`roles/cloudasset.viewer`). Owner/Editor usually already include enough
     access; otherwise ask an admin to grant that role. Docs:
     https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/view-assets

  [Y] I've enabled it (and have access) — retry Cloud Asset Inventory
  [N] Continue with per-service fallback
  ```

  - **[Y]** → wait for the user, then re-run the asset-search command **once**.
    Success → continue as the Success path above; record
    `cai_enable_offered: true`, `cai_enable_accepted: true` in the manifest.
    Still failing → tell the user briefly (if 403/PERMISSION_DENIED, mention
    `roles/cloudasset.viewer` again), then fall through to per-service (same
    as [N]); record `cai_enable_accepted: true` and the retry failure note.
  - **[N]** / no response treated as decline → fall through to per-service;
    record `cai_enable_offered: true`, `cai_enable_accepted: false`.

  **Permission denied** (403 / `PERMISSION_DENIED` without the disable signals
  above — API may already be on, but the identity lacks Cloud Asset access):

  Offer **once** (IAM guidance only — never grant roles yourself):

  ```
  ─── Cloud Asset Inventory permission denied ───

  The Cloud Asset API appears enabled, but this identity cannot search assets
  on [$GCP_PROJECT]. Grant Cloud Asset Viewer (`roles/cloudasset.viewer`) on
  the project (or a role that includes `cloudasset.assets.searchAllResources` /
  list permissions), then retry. Docs:
  https://docs.cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/view-assets

  [Y] I've updated IAM — retry Cloud Asset Inventory
  [N] Continue with per-service fallback
  ```

  Same [Y]/[N] recording rules as the enable soft-ask
  (`cai_enable_offered` / `cai_enable_accepted` — here "enable" means "CAI
  access remediation offered").

  **Other errors** (network, unexpected failures): do **not** soft-ask.
  Fall through to per-service immediately; record `cai_enable_offered: false`.

  **Per-service fallthrough:** record `method: "per_service"` and run every
  applicable table row below. Always keep the failed asset-search entry in
  `captures[]` with `status: "failed"` and the stderr summary in `note`.

**2b. Capture Command Table.** Each row redirects to the named file. On
"API not enabled" / permission errors: record the row as `failed` or `skipped`
in the manifest and continue — a missing service is normal, never a halt.
(Unlike the CAI fast path, do **not** soft-ask to enable individual service
APIs — too many rows, and "service not deployed" vs "API disabled" is ambiguous
from list errors alone.)

**Row 1 note:** managed Cloud Run lists services across ALL regions when
`--region` is omitted — do not pass a `--region` flag (a `--region=-` form is
not documented).

**Region-walk note (rows 10 and 16):** Redis and Vertex endpoint lists are
per-region, so their coverage is exactly the set of regions walked. Determine it
by mode:

- **Asset-search mode:** walk the regions of the matching assets in
  `assets.json` (`redis.googleapis.com/*` locations for row 10,
  `aiplatform.googleapis.com/*` locations for row 16). Asset search is
  project-wide, so no region can hide an instance from this walk.
- **Per-service mode:** walk EVERY region from row 20's `regions.json`. Do NOT
  derive the walk from regions seen in other rows' output — that heuristic
  fails in both directions (an instance in a region with no other footprint is
  silently missed on custom-mode VPCs, while auto-mode VPC subnets inflate the
  "seen" set to every region anyway, without the honesty of saying so).
- **Row 20 failed?** Fall back to the regions seen in rows 1–9 output, and
  append to the manifest (→ `live_metadata.capture_warnings`):
  `"regions list unavailable — redis/vertex walk limited to regions observed in
  other captures; instances in other regions are not covered"`.

**Sizing caveat:** SQL `settings.dataDiskSizeGb` is PROVISIONED disk, not actual
data volume. Downstream database-migration tool selection must treat it as an
upper bound. (Follow-up: enrich with actual data size from monitoring metrics.
Also follow-up: live-only compute resources are not graviton-profiled in v1 —
`graviton_profile` entries come from the IaC path only.)

**Scale guard:** if `assets.json` (or any capture) exceeds ~100 resources, write a
throwaway extraction script to `$MIGRATION_DIR/_extract_live.py` that projects only
the fields needed by Step 3, run it, write its JSON output next to the raw file
with a `-extracted.json` suffix, and delete the script. Never Read the oversized
raw file directly.

**2c. Write the manifest** — `$MIGRATION_DIR/live-capture/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "captured_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "gcloud_version": "<first line of gcloud --version>",
  "account": "<active account email>",
  "project": "<$GCP_PROJECT>",
  "method": "asset_search|per_service",
  "cai_enable_offered": false,
  "cai_enable_accepted": null,
  "captures": [
    { "command": "<row command>", "file": "<file>", "status": "ok|failed|skipped", "note": null }
  ]
}
```

Every attempted or deliberately skipped row gets an entry. `cai_enable_offered` /
`cai_enable_accepted` record the Step 2a soft-ask (`accepted` is `true` /
`false` / `null` when never offered).

## Step 3: Map Captures to Inventory Resources

Synthesize Terraform-style identity so downstream design-refs (keyed on
`google_*` types) work unchanged:

- `address` = `{terraform_type}.{sanitized_resource_name}` (lowercase, `-`→`_`)
- `type` = from the mapping table below
- `name` = sanitized resource name
- `config` = the projected fields from the capture (redaction rules from the
  Security Contract apply)
- `source` = `"live"` on every entry

**Asset/CLI type → Terraform type mapping:**

**Classification:** apply `discover-iac.md` Step 3S rules — the Priority 1 PRIMARY
types list, everything else SECONDARY with role inferred from type
(`google_service_account` → identity; networks/subnets/DNS → network_path;
secrets → encryption; else configuration). `confidence: 0.99`.

**AI detection:** if any `aiplatform.googleapis.com/*` asset or Vertex endpoint was
captured, populate `ai_detection` exactly as `discover-iac.md` Step 2 would
(signal method `"live_gcloud"`, confidence 95, `ai_services: ["vertex_ai"]`,
`has_ai_workload: true`). Otherwise `has_ai_workload: false`, `confidence: 0`.

## Step 4: Infer Edges from Resolved Config

Live captures contain resolved values, which often beat HCL references. Build
`edges[]` using ONLY these deterministic rules (evidence = the config field path):

| Config field (captured)                                         | Edge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

No other inference — do not guess relationships from names, labels, or env var

## Step 5: Cluster (Simplified Mode)

Apply `discover-iac.md` **Step 3S** clustering rules regardless of resource count
(networking cluster at depth 0; one cluster per PRIMARY plus its `serves`
secondaries at depth 1; same `{category}_{type}_{region}_{sequence}` naming;
region from the captured `region`/`location`/zone-derived-region). Set metadata
`"clustering_mode": "simplified_live"`. If more than 25 PRIMARY resources were
captured, warn the user that clustering is coarse at this scale and suggest
narrowing to specific services or regions — but continue.

**Live-specific clustering rules** (Step 3S assumes files, which don't exist here):

- **Regionless resources** (Pub/Sub topics, global buckets without a single
  region): use `"global"` as the region component of `cluster_id` and
  `gcp_region`.
- **Shared secondaries** (e.g., one service account serving multiple primaries):
  assign the resource to the cluster of the FIRST primary in its `serves[]`
  array; `serves[]` still lists all of them.
- **Evidence-less secondaries** (no Step 4 edge and empty `serves[]`, e.g.,
  secrets): do NOT attach them to an unrelated primary's cluster and do NOT
  fabricate a `serves` relationship. Group them into their own cluster per
  category+region (e.g., `security_secrets_global_001`) at depth 1.

## Step 6: Merge with IaC Discovery (only if `discover-iac.md` produced output)

If `gcp-resource-inventory.json` does NOT already exist, skip to Step 7 (live is
the sole source).

Otherwise the IaC inventory + clusters are the BASE. Match live↔IaC entries by
Terraform `type` + GCP resource name, treating these type pairs as EQUIVALENT
for matching (same underlying service; live always maps to the newer type):
`google_cloud_run_service` ≡ `google_cloud_run_v2_service`, and
`google_cloudfunctions_function` ≡ `google_cloudfunctions2_function` when the
GCP name matches. Without this aliasing, a v1-declared resource produces FALSE
drift (flagged both `not_found_live` and `unmanaged_by_terraform`). The merged
entry keeps the IaC address; a note in `config` (`"live_type"`) records the
newer live type. Match names as: live `name` vs the IaC resource's
`config.name` — for service accounts use `config.account_id` (the email
local-part IS the SA's GCP name; the address name component often differs) —
falling back to the address name component). Then:

1. **Matched:** keep the IaC entry (its address, classification, cluster,
   depth). Overwrite `config` values where live disagrees — sizing, capacity,
   versions, and images alike (live reflects reality). Live-only fields the IaC
   never declared are enrichment, not conflicts. Record every OVERWRITTEN field in
   `live_metadata.drift.config_conflicts[]` as
   `{ "address", "field", "terraform_value", "live_value" }`. Set
   `source: "live+terraform"`.
2. **Live-only:** append the entry with `unmanaged_by_terraform: true`. Attach it
   to an existing cluster of the same category+region when one exists; otherwise
   append a new simplified cluster (and add it to `creation_order` at its depth).
3. **IaC-only:** set `source: "terraform"` on every unmatched IaC entry. Set
   `not_found_live: true` ONLY if the capture covering that resource's service
   succeeded (manifest `ok`). If the relevant capture failed or was skipped,
   leave the entry otherwise untouched — absence of evidence is not drift.
4. **Drift summary:** `live_metadata.drift = { "resources_live_only": N,
   "resources_terraform_only": M, "config_conflicts": [...] }`.
   `resources_terraform_only` counts ONLY entries with `not_found_live: true`
   (confirmed absent), never capture-failed unknowns.
5. **Merged metadata:** keep the IaC base's `clustering_mode` (`"simplified"` or
   absent for full clustering) — `"simplified_live"` is for live-only runs. Set
   `metadata.discovery_sources` to include both sources.

Never silently resolve a disagreement — every conflict lands in the drift record.

## Step 7: Write Output Files

Load `references/shared/schema-discover-iac.md` (if not already loaded) and
write/update:

1. `$MIGRATION_DIR/gcp-resource-inventory.json` — exact schema; plus:
   - `metadata.discovery_sources`: `["live"]`, `["terraform", "live"]`, etc.
   - `metadata.clustering_mode`: `"simplified_live"` (live-only runs)
   - top-level `live_metadata`:

   ```json
   {
     "found": true,
     "captured_at": "<from manifest>",
     "project": "<$GCP_PROJECT>",
     "method": "asset_search|per_service",
     "cai_enable_offered": false,
     "cai_enable_accepted": null,
     "capture_warnings": ["<failed/skipped manifest entries>"],
     "unmapped_asset_types": { "<asset type>": 2 },
     "drift": { "resources_live_only": 0, "resources_terraform_only": 0, "config_conflicts": [] }
   }
   ```

   Copy `cai_enable_offered` / `cai_enable_accepted` from the manifest. (`drift`
   present only when Step 6 merged.)

2. `$MIGRATION_DIR/gcp-resource-clusters.json` — exact schema (merged or fresh).
3. Validate per `discover-iac.md` Step 7c (every resource in exactly one cluster,
   IDs consistent, valid JSON). Report: "Live discovery: X resources captured from
   project [id] (Y unmanaged by Terraform, Z config conflicts)."

The parent `discover.md` owns the phase status update — do not touch
`.phase-status.json` here.

| Every capture failed                               | Exit with no output; tell the user which permissions are missing (`roles/viewer` covers all rows)                                                  |

**Key principle:** partial results are better than no results. Record what failed;
never fabricate what wasn't captured.
