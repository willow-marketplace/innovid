# AWS Startups Prompt & Agent Library

Searchable index of AWS-curated prompts for AI coding tools (Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) plus downloadable installable agents. Content is verbatim from [aws.amazon.com/startups/prompt-library](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/prompt-library).

**Last updated:** 2026-05-12

## Where to start

Open [`references/prompt-library.md`](references/prompt-library.md) — it's the index. Filter by the **Keywords** column (e.g., `RAG`, `Security & Compliance`, `Cost Optimization`, `EKS`, `Beginner`, `Bedrock`), then open the linked detail file under `references/prompt-library/<slug>.md`. Each detail file carries the full verbatim **System Prompt** plus a **How to use?** section where available.

The index has three sections:

1. **Prompts — searchable index** — copy-paste prompts.
2. **Downloadable agents** — installable agents that clone from a GitHub repo.
3. **Frequently Asked Questions** — guidance on writing a good prompt, costs, safety, no-technical-background usage, monitoring.

## Handing over a prompt — match the host context

**You ARE already inside an AI coding agent (Claude Code / Kiro / Cursor / etc.). Don't tell the user to "paste this into your AI tool" — you ARE the AI tool.**

When the user asks for a prompt:

1. Read the index in `references/prompt-library.md`, filter by keyword, identify the matching slug.
2. Open `references/prompt-library/<slug>.md` and read the full System Prompt.
3. Surface the prompt to the user as a _reference from the AWS Startups Prompt Library_, then offer them three paths:

   _"Here's the AWS Startups reference prompt for `<task>`. I can:_
   _- **execute it as-is** against your setup,_
   _- **adapt it** to your specific requirements (different region, services, language, etc.), or_
   _- you can **copy it** as a starting point._

   _How would you like to proceed?"_

4. Don't assume intent. Wait for the user's call (execute / adapt / copy) before acting.

## Downloadable agents — different surface from prompts

The **Downloadable agents** section of `references/prompt-library.md` lists **installable agents**, not copy-paste prompts:

- **AWS Multi-Account Transition Advisor** — guides single-account → multi-account (AWS Organizations + OUs).
- **AWS Bill Shock Preventer** — proactive cost-spike detection and alerting.
- **AWS Service Quota Agent** — auditing and requesting quota increases.

When the user's intent matches one of these — _"set up multi-account"_, _"prevent bill shock"_, _"audit service quotas"_ — recommend the matching agent **by title and use-case**, then hand over the GitHub repo / install link from the index file. Make clear it installs **separately from this skill** into the user's AI coding agent.

For migration intent — _"help me migrate to AWS"_, _"GCP to AWS"_, _"move off OpenAI to Bedrock"_ — route to the **`migration-to-aws`** skill in the `aws-startup-advisor` plugin.

## Companion skills — when to defer

This skill is **prompts and installable agents only**. Two sibling skills cover adjacent jobs:

- **`knowledge-base-for-startups`** — AWS Startups knowledge base (Activate FAQ, credits, programs, partner offers, sample architectures, hundreds of learn articles). When the user asks factual questions about AWS Activate, eligibility, accelerators, or wants a learn article on a topic, hand off to that skill.
- **`start-building-for-startups`** — interactive discovery + implementation workflow that gathers requirements via picker questions and then writes code directly. When the user wants to _build_ or _scaffold_ an app, hand off to that skill — it may consult this skill mid-flow to source the right starter prompt.

Boundary cases — invoke both. Example: _"how do I start with RAG on Bedrock?"_ → this skill for the starter prompt (`rag-chatbot-with-claude.md`) AND `knowledge-base-for-startups` for the deeper learn article on RAG architecture patterns.

## Answer style

- **MUST read the detail file before quoting a System Prompt.** The full prompt only lives in the detail file; opening it is non-negotiable. Do not quote a System Prompt from memory or from the index alone.
- **MUST quote the System Prompt verbatim.** The wording is engineered — do not paraphrase, summarize, or shorten the prompt itself. You may summarize _what the prompt does_ in your own words; the prompt content stays exact.
- **MUST cite `source_url`.** Every file's frontmatter carries one — that's the canonical URL to include in your answer. Never construct or guess a URL.
- **MUST NOT tell the user to paste the prompt elsewhere.** You ARE the AI coding agent (see "Handing over a prompt" above). Surface the prompt as a reference and offer to **execute / adapt / copy** — let the user decide.
- **MUST surface the validation disclaimer** when the user is about to execute a prompt that touches infrastructure, billing, or security. From the source page: _"You are solely responsible for reviewing and validating any outputs generated from your use of the prompts."_

## Context loading rule

Open `references/prompt-library.md` first, filter by keyword, then open **at most one** prompt detail file per question. MUST NOT speculatively load multiple detail files. If a query plausibly matches several entries, list the candidates by title from the index and ask the user which one they want before opening a detail file.

## Scope notes

This skill **cannot**:

- Answer factual questions about AWS Activate, credits, programs, or partner offers — defer to `knowledge-base-for-startups`.
- Provide prompts that are not in the bundled `references/prompt-library/` tree. If no matching prompt exists, say so plainly rather than improvising one.
- Install the downloadable agents on the user's behalf. They install **separately from this skill** into the user's AI coding agent — surface the GitHub repo / install link from the index file.
- Override the source-page disclaimer. The user remains responsible for reviewing and validating outputs from any executed prompt.

## Freshness check — surface after every answer

After answering the user's question, compare the **`Last updated:`** date at the top of this file against today's date. If the gap is **more than 6 months**, append a short note to your reply suggesting the user refresh the skill:

> _"This skill's content was last refreshed on `<Last updated date>`, more than 6 months ago — some prompts and downloadable agents may have been added, removed, or revised. To pull the latest content, run:_
>
> - _`npx skills update prompt-library-for-startups` — update the installed copy to the latest version_
>
> _Then restart your AI agent so the new content is picked up."_

Do **not** show this note when the skill is fresh (≤6 months). Do **not** repeat it within a single conversation; once is enough.
