# Estimate Phase: AI Workload Cost Analysis

> Loaded by estimate.md when aws-design-ai.json exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Pricing Mode

The parent `estimate.md` selects the pricing mode before loading this file.

**Price lookup order:**

1. **`shared/pricing-cache.md` (primary)** — Look up Bedrock model pricing and source provider pricing by table. Set `pricing_source: "cached"`.
2. **MCP (secondary)** — If a model is NOT in pricing-cache.md and MCP is available, query `get_pricing("AmazonBedrock", ...)` with model filter and the user's target region. Set `pricing_source: "live"`.
3. **Cache after MCP failure** — If MCP was attempted but failed, and the model IS in the cache, use the cached price. Set `pricing_source: "cached_fallback"`.
4. **Unavailable** — If a model is NOT in the cache AND MCP failed, set `pricing_source: "unavailable"` and warn the user.

For typical migrations (Claude, Llama, Nova, Mistral, DeepSeek, Gemma, OpenAI gpt-oss, Gemini source pricing), ALL prices are in `pricing-cache.md`. Zero MCP calls needed.

**Model lifecycle:** When building the model comparison table, check `references/shared/ai-model-lifecycle.md` and apply the 90-day exclusion rule:

- **Excluded** (≤90 days to EOL): omit entirely from `model_comparison`, `recommended_model`, and `backup_model`.
- **Legacy** (>90 days to EOL): include in `model_comparison` with `(Legacy — EOL YYYY-MM-DD)` annotation. Do not select as `recommended_model` unless no Active alternative exists.
- **Active**: no restrictions.

## Prerequisites

Read from `$MIGRATION_DIR/`:

- **`ai-workload-profile.json`** — `current_costs.monthly_ai_spend`, `current_costs.services_detected`, `models[]`, `metadata.profile_source`, `summary.inferred_from_iac`
- **`preferences.json`** — `ai_constraints.ai_token_volume.value`, `ai_constraints.ai_capabilities_required.value`
- **`aws-design-ai.json`** — `metadata.ai_source`, `ai_architecture.honest_assessment`, `ai_architecture.tiered_strategy`, `ai_architecture.bedrock_models[]` (with `source_provider_price`, `bedrock_price`, `honest_assessment`), `ai_architecture.capability_mapping`

---

## Part 1: Establish Current GCP AI Costs

Determine current Vertex AI spending from the best available source:

1. **Billing data (preferred)** — Use `current_costs.monthly_ai_spend` from `ai-workload-profile.json`
2. **Estimated from token volume** — Use `ai_constraints.ai_token_volume.value` from `preferences.json` with Gemini pricing from `pricing-cache.md` (under "Source Provider Pricing"). Apply 60/40 input/output ratio if actual ratio unknown.
3. **Neither available** — Note in output and present model comparison at multiple volume tiers so user can find their range.

**IaC-only profile:** If `metadata.profile_source` is `iac_vertex` or `summary.inferred_from_iac` is true and billing/token data is missing, state explicitly that **current GCP AI spend is unverified** and widen uncertainty bands (use the same multi-tier comparison approach as in case 3).

---

## Part 2: Build Model Comparison Table

Calculate the monthly Bedrock cost for **every viable model** at the user's token volume.

**Token volume mapping** (from `ai_token_volume` in `preferences.json`):

| `ai_token_volume` | Input tokens/month | Output tokens/month | Ratio |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| `"low"`           | 6M                 | 4M                  | 60/40 |
| `"medium"`        | 60M                | 40M                 | 60/40 |
| `"high"`          | 600M               | 400M                | 60/40 |
| `"very_high"`     | 6B                 | 4B                  | 60/40 |

If design or discover phase has more specific token estimates, use those instead.

**Cost formula:** `Monthly = (input_tokens / 1M × input_rate) + (output_tokens / 1M × output_rate)`

**Long-context surcharge:** If `ai_critical_feature = "ultra_long_context"` in `preferences.json`, Claude models charge 2x the standard input rate for tokens beyond 200K context. Apply the surcharge to the portion of input tokens that exceeds 200K per request. If per-request token counts are unknown, assume 50% of input tokens fall in the long-context tier as a conservative estimate.

**Comparison table columns:** Model, Bedrock Monthly, vs Source Provider ($ and %), vs Current GCP, Quality, Capabilities Match (checked against `ai_capabilities_required`).

Include source provider pricing from `aws-design-ai.json` → `bedrock_models[].source_provider_price`.

If Bedrock is more expensive for the recommended model, flag prominently.

If embeddings are needed, add a separate line (additive to primary model cost).

---

## Part 3: Recommended Model Cost Breakdown

Using the model selected in the design phase, show:

- Input tokens × rate, output tokens × rate, embeddings × rate (if applicable)
- Total monthly cost
- Comparison to current GCP spend (monthly and annual difference)
- Backup model cost for comparison

---

## Part 4: Human One-Time Migration Costs (Out of Scope)

**Do not** present human labor, contractors, professional services, or engineering effort as one-time migration **costs** or budget line items (no dollar figures, no "budget for people work" lists, no "one-time migration cost" categories for implementation).

Populate `migration_cost_considerations.categories` as an **empty array** `[]`. Use `migration_cost_considerations.note` to state that human and professional-services one-time migration costs are intentionally excluded from this advisor.

**Technical integration complexity** (for internal JSON and risk context only — not framed as money):

From `ai-workload-profile.json`, record non-monetary factors in `migration_cost_considerations.complexity_factors[]` as short strings, for example:

- `integration.pattern = "framework"` → lower integration touch surface
- `integration.pattern = "direct_sdk"` → moderate SDK and API pattern changes
- `integration.pattern = "rest_api"` → higher endpoint, auth, and parsing changes
- `summary.total_models_detected` > 3 → multi-model coordination
- `quota_risk = "high"` (from `aws-design-ai.json`) → Bedrock quota increase required before migration; allow 1–5 business days (see `shared/bedrock-quotas.md`)

Do **not** repeat these as "costs" in the user-facing summary.

---

## Part 5: ROI Analysis

Present the monthly and annual cost difference between current GCP AI spend and projected Bedrock cost:

- **If Bedrock is cheaper**: present monthly and annual savings clearly
- **If Bedrock is more expensive**: state clearly, justify with non-cost benefits or note "not justified if cost is the only priority"

Reference `aws-design-ai.json` → `honest_assessment`. If `"recommend_stay"`, present prominently.

**Non-cost benefits to present:** model flexibility (30+ models), prompt caching (Claude, 90% savings), AWS ecosystem (Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, Agents), vendor diversification, multi-model strategy.

**Note:** Human/professional-services one-time migration costs are intentionally out of scope for this advisor and excluded from ROI calculations.

---

## Part 6: Cost Optimization Opportunities

Present applicable optimizations with estimated savings:

| Optimization               | Savings | Applies When                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Model downsizing / tiering | 60-87%  | High volume, premium model selected                 |
| Prompt caching (Claude)    | ~30%    | Repeated system prompts                             |
| Batch API                  | 50%     | Non-real-time workloads (`ai_latency = "flexible"`) |
| Provisioned throughput     | Varies  | Token volume > 100M/month, predictable traffic      |
| Input token reduction      | 10-30%  | Prompt optimization, shorter context                |
| Multi-model tiered routing | 60-87%  | High/very-high volume, `tiered_strategy` in design  |

For each applicable optimization, calculate before/after monthly cost and show an `optimized_projection` (best-case monthly with all optimizations).

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `model_comparison` includes ALL viable Bedrock models, not just recommended
- [ ] Legacy models in `model_comparison` are annotated with EOL dates (per `shared/ai-model-lifecycle.md`)
- [ ] `recommended_model` is an Active model (not Legacy) unless no Active alternative exists
- [ ] Every model has `capabilities_match` checked against `ai_capabilities_required`
- [ ] `recommended_model.rationale` references user's priority, preference, and volume
- [ ] `roi_analysis` is honest — if migration increases cost, says so
- [ ] `optimization_opportunities` only includes strategies relevant to user's workload
- [ ] No compute, database, storage, or networking costs (those belong in `estimate-infra.md`)
- [ ] `migration_cost_considerations.categories` is `[]` — no human one-time migration costs presented

## Completion Handoff Gate (Fail Closed)

Before returning control to `estimate.md`, require:

- `estimation-ai.json` exists and passes the Validation Checklist above.

If this gate fails: STOP and output: "estimate-ai did not produce a valid `estimation-ai.json`; do not complete Phase 4."

## Present Summary

After writing `estimation-ai.json`, present under 25 lines:

1. **Pricing source and accuracy**: State whether prices came from cache or live API, and the accuracy range (±15-25% for AI models from cache, ±5-10% from live API). Example: "AI model estimates based on cached pricing (2026-03-07), accuracy ±15-25%."
2. Current GCP AI spend vs projected Bedrock cost (recommended model)
3. Model comparison table: model name, monthly cost, vs source provider %, capabilities match
4. Recommended model with cost breakdown
5. If migration increases cost: flag honestly with non-cost justification
6. Top 2-3 optimization opportunities with potential savings
7. Optimized projection

## Generate Phase Integration

The Generate phase uses `estimation-ai.json`:

1. **`recommended_model`** — Which Bedrock model to provision and test
2. **`migration_cost_considerations`** — `complexity_factors[]` only for integration risk context; **never** present human one-time migration **costs** to the user (`categories` stays `[]`)
3. **`optimization_opportunities`** — Which optimizations to implement and when
4. **`cost_comparison`** — Cost monitoring targets and alerts in production
5. **`model_comparison`** — Fallback options if recommended model doesn't meet quality bar

## Scope Boundary

**This phase covers financial analysis ONLY for AI workloads.**

FORBIDDEN — Do NOT include compute, database, storage, networking cost calculations, infrastructure provisioning, code migration examples, or detailed migration timelines.
