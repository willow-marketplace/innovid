# Estimate Phase: Infrastructure Cost Analysis

> Loaded by estimate.md when aws-design.json exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Pricing Mode

The parent `estimate.md` determines pricing source before loading this file.

**Price lookup order for each AWS service in `aws-design.json`:**

1. **`shared/pricing-cache.md` (primary)** — Read once. **Before using, check staleness:** compute `days_since_cache = today − cache "Last updated" date`. If `days_since_cache > 30`, set `pricing_source: "cached_stale"` for all AI model prices and prepend a warning to the estimate output: "Pricing cache is more than 30 days old — AI model prices may have changed. Verify via the AWS Pricing MCP server or aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing." Infrastructure prices (Fargate, RDS, S3, etc.) remain reliable; only AI model prices need the stale flag. If `days_since_cache ≤ 30`, use the price directly and set `pricing_source: "cached"`.
2. **MCP with recipes (secondary)** — If a service is NOT in pricing-cache.md and MCP is available, use the Pricing Recipes table below. Set `pricing_source: "live"`.
3. **Cache after MCP failure** — If MCP was attempted but failed, and the service IS in the cache, use the cached price. Set `pricing_source: "cached_fallback"`.
4. **Unavailable** — If a service is NOT in the cache AND MCP failed, set `pricing_source: "unavailable"`. Add to `services_with_missing_fallback` and warn the user.

For typical migrations (Fargate, Aurora/RDS, Aurora Serverless v2, S3, ALB, NAT Gateway, Lambda, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, ElastiCache, DynamoDB), ALL prices are in `pricing-cache.md`. Zero MCP calls needed.

## Step 0: Validate Design Output

Before pricing queries, validate `aws-design.json`:

1. **File exists**: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Phase 3 (Design) not completed. Run Phase 3 first."
2. **Valid JSON**: If parse fails, **STOP**. Output: "Design file corrupted (invalid JSON). Re-run Phase 3."
3. **Required fields**:
   - `clusters` array is not empty: If empty, **STOP**. Output: "No clusters in design. Re-run Phase 3."
   - Each cluster has `resources` array: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Cluster [id] missing resources. Re-run Phase 3."
   - Each resource has `aws_service` field: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Resource [address] missing aws_service. Re-run Phase 3."
   - Each resource has `aws_config` field: If missing, **STOP**. Output: "Resource [address] missing aws_config. Re-run Phase 3."

If all validations pass, proceed to Part 1.

## Pricing Recipes (MCP Fallback Only)

Only use these recipes when a service is NOT in `pricing-cache.md` and MCP is available.
Do NOT call get_pricing_service_codes, get_pricing_service_attributes, or get_pricing_attribute_values — go directly to get_pricing.

**Important notes on MCP filters:**

- **Fargate**: Use `productFamily=Compute`, NOT EC2-style filters (operatingSystem, tenancy, capacitystatus do not exist in AmazonECS)
- **Aurora (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: Use `deploymentOption=Single-AZ`. Aurora handles multi-AZ replication natively — there is no "Multi-AZ" pricing option for Aurora
- **Lambda**: Filter by `group=AWS-Lambda-Duration` for compute pricing, separate call with `group=AWS-Lambda-Requests` for request pricing
- **CloudWatch**: Filter by specific `usagetype=DataProcessing-Bytes` for log ingestion pricing (avoids pulling all vended log types)

**Batching rule:** If MCP calls are needed, group up to 4 requests in parallel per turn.

## Part 1: Calculate Current GCP Costs

Determine the current GCP monthly infrastructure costs. Use the best available source:

1. **`billing-profile.json` (preferred)** — Use actual billing data as the GCP baseline. Highest confidence (±5%).
2. **`gcp-resource-inventory.json` (fallback)** — Estimate costs from discovered resource configurations. Wider range (±20-30%).
3. **`preferences.json` → `gcp_monthly_spend`** — User-provided monthly spend from clarification.
4. **Ask the user** — If none of the above are available, ask: "I need your current GCP monthly spend to produce a meaningful cost comparison. What is your approximate GCP monthly infrastructure cost?" Use the user's answer. If the user declines or is unsure, present AWS costs without a GCP comparison and note: "GCP baseline unavailable — AWS costs shown without comparison."

Present the GCP baseline as a total and per-service breakdown, noting which source was used.

### CUD-Aware Baseline (when billing data available)

If `billing-profile.json` contains `commitments.has_active_cuds == true`:

1. **Use list price as the GCP baseline**: The `services[].monthly_cost` values already use list price (commitment fee rows excluded by discover phase). Use `cost_basis.total_at_list` as the total GCP baseline for comparison.
2. **Do not include commitment fees in workload costs**: Commitment fee rows are billing artifacts with no AWS equivalent — they are already excluded from `services[]`.
3. **Record the effective discount for Part 3**: Note `commitments.effective_discount_percent` — this is the customer's current GCP discount rate that will be compared against AWS Savings Plan rates.

This ensures the comparison is GCP list price vs. AWS on-demand (both uncommitted baselines), with commitment options presented separately as optimization opportunities.

---

## Part 2: Calculate Projected AWS Costs

**Security baseline coverage (always required):** Add a `security_baseline` entry to `projected_costs.breakdown` with `service: "AWS Security Baseline (Tier 1)"`, low/mid/high estimates of $3/$15/$30 per month, `accuracy: "±25%"`, and a `components` sub-object breaking down CloudTrail S3 storage (~$1.50/mo mid), GuardDuty (~~$13/mo mid after free trial), AWS Budgets ($0), and the free controls. If `preferences.json.compliance` contains any of `soc2`, `pci`, `hipaa`, `fedramp`, also add a sibling `security_baseline_compliance` entry with low/mid/high estimates of $3/$14/$25 per month, `accuracy: "±25%"`, `emission_reason` field citing the declared compliance values, and a `components` sub-object breaking down AWS Config (~$6/mo mid continuous), Config S3 storage (~~ $0.50/mo mid), Security Hub + FSBP (~$7/mo mid after free trial), and extra standards (free). Per-unit rates are grounded in the AWS Pricing API for us-east-1 as of 2026-05-04 (Config pricing effective 2025-09-01, Security Hub effective 2026-03-01). Cite source as `references/shared/pricing-cache.md § Security Baseline` or live `get_pricing` calls for `AmazonGuardDuty`, `AWSConfig`, and `AWSSecurityHub` service codes. Both line items are added as flat additives to each tier total (Premium/Balanced/Optimized) rather than being tier-dependent.

For each service in `aws-design.json`, calculate monthly cost using rates from `pricing-cache.md`. Track `pricing_source` per service.

**Secret Manager coverage (mandatory):** If any mapped resource has `gcp_type` of `google_secret_manager_secret` or `google_secret_manager_secret_version`, ensure an `aws_service` entry for **Secrets Manager** is present in the estimate breakdown. Do not collapse this into a generic "supporting" line item.

**BigQuery / deferred analytics (mandatory):** For any resource where `aws_service` is exactly **`Deferred — specialist engagement`** OR `gcp_type` starts with `google_bigquery_`:

- **Do not** apply Athena, Redshift, Glue, or EMR rates as the plugin’s “projected” analytics stack.
- **Exclude** these resources from Premium / Balanced / Optimized **numeric totals** (or list them under a `deferred_services[]` / `excluded_from_totals` section in `estimation-infra.json` with reason: _pending specialist engagement_).
- In the user-facing summary, state that **AWS analytics costs are unknown** until the **AWS account team** and/or **data analytics migration partner** defines the target architecture.

Calculate 3 cost tiers to show the optimization range:

| Tier          | Description                             | Examples                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premium**   | Latest generation, highest availability | db.r6g instances, Fargate Spot disabled, Multi-AZ everything        |
| **Balanced**  | Standard generation, typical setup      | db.t4g instances, Fargate on-demand, Single-AZ where acceptable     |
| **Optimized** | Cost-minimized with trade-offs          | db.t4g with reserved pricing, Fargate Spot 70%, S3-IA for cold data |

**Per-service calculation approach:**

| Domain                     | Formula                                                                               | Key inputs from aws-design.json                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compute (Fargate)          | (vCPU × vCPU rate + memory GB × memory rate) × 730 hours × instance count             | `aws_config.cpu`, `aws_config.memory`                                         |
| Compute (Lambda)           | requests × request rate + (requests × duration × memory GB) × GB-second rate          | Estimated from usage patterns                                                 |
| Database (Aurora)          | instance rate × 730 hours × instance count + storage GB × storage rate + I/O estimate | `aws_config.instance_class`, `aws_config.allocated_storage`                   |
| Database (RDS)             | instance rate × 730 hours × instance count + storage GB × storage rate                | `aws_config.instance_class`, `aws_config.allocated_storage`                   |
| Storage (S3)               | GB × per-GB rate + request estimates                                                  | `aws_config.storage_gb` or source `gcp_config`                                |
| Networking (ALB)           | fixed monthly + LCU estimate                                                          | From compute service count                                                    |
| Networking (NAT)           | fixed monthly × count + GB processed × data rate                                      | From VPC design                                                               |
| Security (Secrets Manager) | secrets_count × per-secret monthly rate + api_calls_10k × per-10K API rate            | `aws_config.secrets_count`, `aws_config.api_calls_10k` (or inferred defaults) |
| Supporting                 | Per-unit rates × quantities (secrets, log GB, metrics)                                | Inferred from service count                                                   |

Show calculation breakdown per service: rate × quantity = cost. Present all 3 tiers side-by-side.

---

## Part 3: Cost Comparison

Present a side-by-side comparison:

- GCP current monthly total (at list price)
- AWS Premium / Balanced / Optimized monthly totals
- Difference (savings or increase) per tier vs GCP
- Per-service breakdown for the Balanced tier

### Commitment Context (if CUDs detected)

If `billing-profile.json` has `commitments.has_active_cuds == true`, add a `commitment_context` section to the comparison:

- **GCP effective committed rate**: The customer currently pays `effective_discount_percent`% below list via CUDs
- **AWS equivalent**: 1-year Savings Plans typically save 20-30%; 3-year Savings Plans save 40-60%
- **Fair comparison framing**: Present both an uncommitted comparison (GCP list vs. AWS on-demand) and a committed comparison (GCP net-of-CUD vs. AWS with 1yr SP)
- **Migration timing note**: If the customer has active CUDs, note that CUD fees continue regardless of usage — migrating mid-commitment means paying both GCP CUD fees and AWS costs until the CUD term expires

Include in `estimation-infra.json` under `cost_comparison`:

```json
"commitment_context": {
  "gcp_has_active_cuds": true,
  "gcp_effective_discount_percent": 8.2,
  "gcp_monthly_at_list": 2450.00,
  "gcp_monthly_net_of_discounts": 2280.00,
  "aws_1yr_savings_plan_typical_discount": "20-30%",
  "aws_3yr_savings_plan_typical_discount": "40-60%",
  "note": "GCP baseline uses list price for apples-to-apples comparison. Customer currently saves 8.2% via CUDs. AWS Savings Plans offer comparable or deeper discounts post-migration."
}
```

If `commitments.has_active_cuds == false` or the section is absent, omit `commitment_context` from the output.

---

## Part 4: GCP Data Transfer Egress (Vendor Fees Only)

This section covers **GCP vendor/network charges** for outbound data during migration — not human labor or professional-services costs (those are never presented as dollar estimates by this advisor).

**Billing data check:** Before generating this section, check if `$MIGRATION_DIR/billing-profile.json` exists.

### IF billing data IS available (`billing-profile.json` exists):

**Data transfer** — egress fees from GCP during migration. GCP charges for outbound data transfer; volume depends on database sizes and storage to migrate. Use the billing data to estimate the volume of data that needs to move.

Set `billing_data_available: true` in the output `migration_cost_considerations` object.

### IF billing data is NOT available (`billing-profile.json` does not exist):

**Omit GCP data transfer fee estimates.** Without billing data, there is no grounding for egress projections. Instead, include only this note in the output:

Set `migration_cost_considerations` to:

```json
{
  "categories": [],
  "billing_data_available": false,
  "note": "Data transfer cost estimates require GCP billing data. Re-run discovery with a GCP billing export to see GCP egress fee projections."
}
```

In the user-facing summary, when billing data is missing, state: "GCP data transfer egress estimates require billing data. Provide a billing export and re-run discovery to see vendor egress projections."

---

## Part 5: ROI Analysis

Present the monthly and annual cost difference between GCP baseline and each AWS tier (Premium, Balanced, Optimized). This is the recurring savings (or increase) the customer can expect.

- If AWS is cheaper: present the monthly and annual savings for each tier
- If AWS is more expensive: state clearly and note that cost savings alone do not justify migration — operational benefits must be the driver

**Operational efficiency factors to highlight** (qualitative — do not assign dollar values):

- Reduction in operational overhead from managed services (Fargate vs self-managed, RDS vs self-hosted DB)
- Reduced on-call burden from AWS-managed HA, patching, and scaling
- Engineering time freed for product work instead of infrastructure maintenance

**Non-cost benefits to present:** operational efficiency, global reach, service breadth, enterprise integration, vendor diversification, scaling flexibility (auto-scaling, spot instances, savings plans).

**Note:** GCP data transfer egress fees (if estimated in Part 4) are **vendor** one-time charges excluded from recurring ROI calculations — not human migration costs.

---

## Part 6: Cost Optimization Opportunities

Present applicable optimizations with estimated savings:

| Optimization                       | Savings Range | Applies To                       | When                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Reserved Instances / Savings Plans | 40-60%        | RDS, Aurora                      | Post-migration (after validating usage) |
| Compute Savings Plans              | 20-50%        | Fargate, Lambda                  | Post-migration                          |
| S3 Intelligent-Tiering / S3-IA     | 38-50%        | S3 storage                       | During migration                        |
| Spot Instances                     | 60-90%        | Batch/non-critical EC2 workloads | If batch jobs exist                     |

For each applicable optimization, calculate the before and after monthly cost.

---

## Part 7: Recommendation

Present 3 paths:

1. **Migrate with Optimizations (Best ROI)** — optimized service choices, monthly cost, projected annual savings
2. **Phased Migration (Lower Risk)** — cluster-by-cluster per design evaluation order, validate each before proceeding
3. **Stay on GCP (Lowest Cost)** — only if AWS is more expensive and costs are the sole metric

Include migrate/stay decision factors:

- **Migrate if:** operational efficiency matters, AWS-specific services needed, batch workloads (Spot savings), long-term AWS strategy, growing infrastructure
- **Stay if:** cost is the only metric and AWS is more expensive, team deeply experienced with GCP, no need for AWS-specific services

---

## Output

Read `shared/schema-estimate-infra.md` for the `estimation-infra.json` schema and validation checklist, then write `estimation-infra.json` to `$MIGRATION_DIR/`.

## Completion Handoff Gate (Fail Closed)

Before returning control to `estimate.md`, require:

- `estimation-infra.json` exists and passes `shared/schema-estimate-infra.md` validation.

If this gate fails: STOP and output: "estimate-infra did not produce a valid `estimation-infra.json`; do not complete Phase 4."

## Present Summary

After writing `estimation-infra.json`, present a concise summary to the user:

1. **Pricing source and accuracy**: State whether prices came from cache or live API, and the accuracy range (±5-10% for infrastructure from cache/live, ±15-25% if cache is stale). Example: "Estimates based on cached AWS pricing (2026-03-07), accuracy ±5-10%."
2. GCP baseline vs AWS projected (balanced tier) — one-line comparison
3. Three-tier table: **Premium**, **Balanced**, **Optimized** with monthly totals. Under or beside each label, use the **short subtitles**: Premium — _Highest resilience / highest monthly estimate in this model_; Balanced — _Default scenario; compare GCP to this first_; Optimized — _Lower monthly estimate; reservations / Spot / storage trade-offs assumed_. Add a one-line **How to read**: three figures are **pricing scenarios** for the same architecture (high → mid → low); **not** three Terraform stacks. When Terraform is generated later, it aligns with **Balanced**.
4. Per-service cost breakdown (balanced tier, 1 line per service)
5. **If billing data available**: Estimated GCP data transfer egress fees. **If billing data NOT available**: "Data transfer cost estimates require GCP billing data."
6. Monthly and annual savings (or increase) vs GCP per tier
7. Top 2-3 optimization opportunities with savings amounts

Keep it under 25 lines. The user can ask for details or re-read `estimation-infra.json` at any time.

## Generate Phase Integration

The Generate phase (`generate.md`) uses `estimation-infra.json` as follows:

1. **`projected_costs.breakdown`** — Budget allocation per cluster migration phase
2. **`migration_cost_considerations`** — Data transfer egress cost estimates (if billing data available)
3. **`optimization_opportunities`** — Which optimizations to implement and when (some during initial migration, some post-migration)
4. **`cost_comparison`** — Set cost monitoring targets and alerts for each migrated cluster
5. **`recommendation.next_steps`** — Prerequisites for starting generation
6. **Cost tier vs Terraform** — Generated **`terraform/`** implements **one** baseline aligned with the **Balanced** scenario; **Premium** and **Optimized** are **estimate-only** bands unless the user changes IaC. See `generate-artifacts-infra.md` (`terraform/README.md`, `migration_summary` output).

The generated artifacts reference the cost estimates to set per-cluster cost monitoring thresholds and validate that actual AWS spend aligns with projections after each cluster migration.
