# Phase 4: Estimate AWS Costs (Orchestrator)

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Step 0: Pricing Mode Selection

Before running any sub-estimate file, determine the pricing source.

### Step 0a: Load Pricing Cache

Read `shared/pricing-cache.md`. Check the `Last updated` date in the header:

- If <= 90 days old: **Cached prices are the primary source.** No MCP calls needed for services listed in the cache. Proceed to Step 1.
- If > 90 days old: Cache is stale. Attempt MCP (Step 0b) for fresh prices; use stale cache as fallback.

### Step 0b: MCP Availability Check (only if cache stale or service not listed)

Attempt to reach awspricing with **up to 2 retries** (3 total attempts):

1. **Attempt 1**: Call `get_pricing_service_codes()`
2. **If timeout/error**: Wait 1 second, retry (Attempt 2)
3. **If still fails**: Wait 2 seconds, retry (Attempt 3)
4. **If all 3 attempts fail**: Use cached prices with staleness warning

### Pricing Hierarchy

Each sub-estimate file uses this lookup order per service:

1. **`shared/pricing-cache.md`** (primary) — Cached prices (±5-25% accuracy). Set `pricing_source: "cached"`. Used first because it requires zero API calls and covers most common services.
2. **MCP API** (secondary) — Real-time pricing for services NOT in pricing-cache.md (±5-10% accuracy, more precise). Set `pricing_source: "live"`. Only called when the cache lacks the needed service or model. **Region note:** The `.mcp.json` sets `AWS_REGION=us-east-1` as the MCP server default, but each `get_pricing()` call accepts a `region` parameter that overrides it. Always pass the user's target region (from `preferences.json`) in MCP queries.
3. **Cache after MCP failure** — If MCP was attempted but failed (timeout, error), and the service IS in the cache, use the cached price. Set `pricing_source: "cached_fallback"`. This distinguishes intentional cache use from MCP failure recovery.
4. **Unavailable** — If a service is NOT in the cache AND MCP is unavailable, set `pricing_source: "unavailable"` for that service. Add the service to `services_with_missing_fallback` and display a warning to the user: "Pricing unavailable for [service] — not in cache and MCP unreachable. Exclude from totals or provide a manual estimate."

**`pricing_source` values summary:**

| Value               | Meaning                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"cached"`          | Found in pricing-cache.md (normal path)                   |
| `"live"`            | Retrieved from MCP API in real-time                       |
| `"cached_fallback"` | MCP was attempted but failed; fell back to cache          |
| `"unavailable"`     | Not in cache AND MCP failed; service excluded from totals |

If cache is > 90 days old and MCP is unavailable:

- Add warning: "Cached pricing data is >90 days old; accuracy may be significantly degraded"
- **Display to user**: Add visible warning with staleness notice

## Step 1: Prerequisites

1. Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/.phase-status.json`. If missing, invalid, or `phases.clarify` is not exactly `"completed"`: **STOP**. Output: "Phase 2 (Clarify) not completed or phase state is missing/invalid. Complete Clarify before Estimate."
2. Read `$MIGRATION_DIR/preferences.json`. If missing: **STOP**. Output: "Phase 2 (Clarify) not completed. Run Phase 2 first."

Check which design artifacts exist in `$MIGRATION_DIR/`:

- `aws-design.json` (infrastructure design from IaC)
- `aws-design-ai.json` (AI workload design)
- `aws-design-billing.json` (billing-only design)

If **none** of these artifacts exist: **STOP**. Output: "No design artifacts found. Run Phase 3 (Design) first."

## Step 2: Routing Rules

### Infrastructure Estimate

IF `aws-design.json` exists:

> Load `estimate-infra.md`

Produces: `estimation-infra.json`

### Billing-Only Estimate

IF `aws-design-billing.json` exists AND `aws-design.json` does **NOT** exist:

> Load `estimate-billing.md`

Produces: `estimation-billing.json`

### AI Estimate

IF `aws-design-ai.json` exists:

> Load `estimate-ai.md`

Produces: `estimation-ai.json`

### Mutual Exclusion

- **estimate-infra** and **estimate-billing** never both run (billing-only is the fallback when no IaC exists).
- **estimate-ai** runs independently of either estimate-infra or estimate-billing (no shared state). Run it after the infra/billing estimate completes.

## Phase Completion

Before marking Estimate complete, enforce route output gates (fail closed):

1. Determine which estimate routes ran:
   - Infra route: `aws-design.json` exists
   - Billing-only route: `aws-design-billing.json` exists AND `aws-design.json` does NOT exist
   - AI route: `aws-design-ai.json` exists
2. Require at least one route to be active. If none active: STOP.
3. For each active route, require its expected artifact:
   - Infra route -> `estimation-infra.json`
   - Billing-only route -> `estimation-billing.json`
   - AI route -> `estimation-ai.json`
4. If any active route is missing its expected output: STOP and output: "Estimate route [name] did not produce required artifact(s). Re-run the failed sub-estimate before completing Phase 4."

After all active route gates pass, use the Phase Status Update Protocol (read-merge-write) to update `.phase-status.json` — **in the same turn** as the output message below:

- Set `phases.estimate` to `"completed"`
- Set `current_phase` to `"generate"`

Output to user: "Cost estimation complete. Proceeding to Phase 5: Generate Migration Artifacts."

## Reference Files

- `shared/pricing-cache.md` — Cached AWS + source provider pricing (±5-25%, primary source)

## Scope Boundary

**This phase covers financial analysis ONLY.**

FORBIDDEN — Do NOT include ANY of:

- Changes to architecture mappings from the Design phase
- Execution timelines or migration schedules
- Terraform or IaC code generation
- Detailed migration procedures or runbooks
- Team staffing or resource allocation

**Your ONLY job: Show the financial picture of moving to AWS. Nothing else.**
