# Generate Phase: Infrastructure Migration Plan

> Loaded by generate.md when estimation-infra.json exists.

**Execute ALL steps in order. Do not skip or optimize.**

## Prerequisites

Read the following artifacts from `$MIGRATION_DIR/`:

- `aws-design.json` (REQUIRED) — AWS architecture design from Phase 3
- `estimation-infra.json` (REQUIRED) — Cost estimates from Phase 4
- `gcp-resource-clusters.json` (REQUIRED) — Cluster dependency graph from Phase 1
- `preferences.json` (REQUIRED) — User migration preferences from Phase 2

If any required file is missing: **STOP**. Output: "Missing required artifact: [filename]. Complete the prior phase that produces it."

## Part 1: Migration Timeline

> **Before building the timeline, load `references/shared/migration-complexity.md` and classify the migration tier using inputs from `aws-design.json`, `gcp-resource-clusters.json`, `estimation-infra.json`, and `preferences.json`.**

Build a timeline using the **Infrastructure Path** ranges for the determined tier. Also consider:

- **Cluster count** from `gcp-resource-clusters.json` — more clusters = longer infrastructure phase
- **Dependency depth** from `creation_order` — deeper graphs need more sequential work
- **Service complexity** from `aws-design.json` — databases and stateful services take longer
- **Cutover strategy** from `preferences.json` — maintenance window vs. blue-green affects timeline

### Small Tier (3-6 weeks)

Compressed setup. PoC is a 2-day smoke test integrated into deployment. No data migration stage (small tier excludes databases by definition).

#### Stage 1: Setup (Week 1)

- Provision VPC, subnets, routing, IAM, monitoring baseline
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for Terraform deployments

#### Stage 2: Deploy + Smoke Test (Week 2)

- Deploy all clusters (few services, shallow dependency graph)
- Validate application connectivity and performance
- Run integration tests
- Confirm cost tracking matches `estimation-infra.json` projections
- **Go/No-Go checkpoint**: If smoke test fails acceptance criteria, stop and reassess

#### Stage 3: Cutover (Weeks 3-4)

- Execute cutover per `preferences.json` cutover_strategy
- Monitor for 24-48 hours post-cutover
- Keep GCP resources running as hot standby

#### Stage 4: Validation + Cleanup (Weeks 5-6)

- Monitor AWS performance for 1 week
- Compare actual costs against projections
- Begin GCP teardown planning (execute teardown after 2-week stability period)

### Medium Tier (8-12 weeks)

Standard phased plan. Apply the data-migration skip rule below.

#### Stage 1: Setup (Weeks 1-2)

- Finalize AWS account structure and billing alerts
- Provision foundational infrastructure: VPC, subnets, routing, NAT gateways
- Configure IAM roles and policies per cluster requirements
- Establish GCP-to-AWS connectivity (VPN or Direct Connect for data migration)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for Terraform deployments
- Configure monitoring baseline (CloudWatch, alarms)

#### Stage 2: Proof of Concept (Weeks 3-4)

- Deploy the **shallowest-depth cluster** (lowest `creation_order_depth`) to AWS
- Validate application connectivity and performance
- Test data pipeline from GCP to AWS (database replication, storage sync)
- Measure baseline latency and throughput
- Confirm cost tracking matches `estimation-infra.json` projections
- **Go/No-Go checkpoint**: If PoC fails acceptance criteria, stop and reassess

#### Stage 3: Infrastructure Deployment (Weeks 5-7)

- Deploy remaining clusters in `creation_order` sequence (depth-first)
- For each cluster:
  - Deploy infrastructure per `aws-design.json` resource mappings
  - Configure cross-cluster networking and security groups
  - Validate service health checks
  - Run integration tests
- Implement monitoring and logging per cluster
- Establish backup and restore procedures

#### Stage 4: Data Migration (Weeks 8-9)

**Include this phase ONLY if `aws-design.json` contains database or storage resources
(see resource detection rules in generate-artifacts-scripts.md Step 1).**
**If no data migration is needed, compress the timeline: move Cutover to Weeks 8-9
and Validation to Week 10. Reduce `total_weeks` accordingly.**

- **Databases**: Set up continuous replication (Cloud SQL to RDS/Aurora)
  - Initial full snapshot transfer
  - Enable ongoing replication (DMS or native replication)
  - Validate data integrity (row counts, checksums)
- **Object storage**: Sync GCS buckets to S3
  - Use AWS DataSync or `gsutil`/`aws s3 sync` for bulk transfer
  - Enable ongoing sync for new objects
- **Secrets**: Migrate secrets from Secret Manager to AWS Secrets Manager
- Establish dual-write pattern for production data

#### Stage 5: Cutover (Weeks 10-11, or Weeks 8-9 if Stage 4 skipped)

- Pre-cutover validation:
  - All clusters deployed and healthy on AWS
  - Data replication lag < 1 second
  - All integration tests passing
  - Rollback procedures tested
- Execute cutover per `preferences.json` cutover_strategy:
  - **maintenance-window**: Schedule downtime, switch DNS, validate
  - **blue-green**: Gradual traffic shift (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Monitor for 24-48 hours post-cutover
- Keep GCP resources running as hot standby

#### Stage 6: Validation and Cleanup (Week 12)

- Monitor AWS performance for 1 full week
- Compare actual costs against `estimation-infra.json` projections
- Run final data integrity checks
- Document any drift or issues
- Begin GCP teardown planning (execute teardown after 2-week stability period)

### Large Tier (12-16 weeks)

Extended timeline for complex migrations. Extra time for multi-cluster orchestration, large data volumes, and extended validation. Apply the data-migration skip rule from Stage 4.

#### Stage 1: Setup (Weeks 1-2)

Same as Medium.

#### Stage 2: Proof of Concept (Weeks 3-4)

Same as Medium.

#### Stage 3: Infrastructure Deployment (Weeks 5-8)

Extended by 1 week for additional clusters and complex cross-cluster networking.

- Deploy remaining clusters in `creation_order` sequence (depth-first)
- For each cluster:
  - Deploy infrastructure per `aws-design.json` resource mappings
  - Configure cross-cluster networking and security groups
  - Validate service health checks
  - Run integration tests
- Implement monitoring and logging per cluster
- Establish backup and restore procedures

#### Stage 4: Data Migration (Weeks 9-11)

**Include this phase ONLY if `aws-design.json` contains database or storage resources.**
**If no data migration is needed, compress the timeline: move Cutover to Weeks 9-10
and Validation to Weeks 11-12. Reduce `total_weeks` accordingly.**

Extended for large data volumes and complex replication topologies.

- **Databases**: Set up continuous replication (Cloud SQL to RDS/Aurora)
  - Initial full snapshot transfer
  - Enable ongoing replication (DMS or native replication)
  - Validate data integrity (row counts, checksums)
- **Object storage**: Sync GCS buckets to S3
  - Use AWS DataSync or `gsutil`/`aws s3 sync` for bulk transfer
  - Enable ongoing sync for new objects
- **Secrets**: Migrate secrets from Secret Manager to AWS Secrets Manager
- Establish dual-write pattern for production data

#### Stage 5: Cutover (Weeks 12-13)

Same structure as Medium, adjusted week numbers.

#### Stage 6: Validation and Cleanup (Weeks 14-16)

Extended monitoring before GCP teardown.

- Monitor AWS performance for 2 full weeks
- Compare actual costs against `estimation-infra.json` projections
- Run final data integrity checks
- Document any drift or issues
- Begin GCP teardown planning (execute teardown after 2-week stability period)

## Part 2: Risk Assessment

Build a risk matrix from the discovered infrastructure and migration complexity.

### Risk Categories

For each risk, assess:

- **Probability**: `"high"` (>60%), `"medium"` (30-60%), `"low"` (<30%)
- **Impact**: `"critical"` (service outage), `"high"` (degraded service), `"medium"` (delayed timeline), `"low"` (minor inconvenience)
- **Mitigation**: Specific action to reduce probability or impact

### Standard Risks

| Risk                             | Probability | Impact   | Mitigation                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data loss during migration       | low         | critical | Dual-write for 2 weeks before cutover; full backup before migration; checksums on all transfers |
| Performance regression on AWS    | medium      | high     | PoC testing (Weeks 3-4); load testing (Week 5); performance baseline comparison                 |
| Extended downtime during cutover | medium      | high     | Practice cutover in staging; automate DNS switch; rollback procedure on standby                 |
| Cost overrun vs estimates        | medium      | medium   | Set billing alerts at 80% and 100% of projected; weekly cost review                             |
| Cross-region latency             | low         | medium   | Validate latency in PoC phase; consider same-region deployment for latency-sensitive services   |
| Terraform state corruption       | low         | high     | Remote state with locking (S3 + DynamoDB); state backups before each apply                      |

### Dynamic Risks

Add additional risks based on discovered infrastructure:

- If **databases with replication** exist: Add "Replication lag during cutover" (medium/high)
- If **stateful services** (Redis, Elasticsearch): Add "State migration data loss" (low/critical)
- If **multiple regions** in GCP: Add "Cross-region dependency during migration" (medium/medium)
- If **AI workloads** coexist: Add "Model performance drift on Bedrock" (medium/high)
- If **BigQuery** resources exist (`google_bigquery_*` or `aws_service` is **`Deferred — specialist engagement`** in `aws-design.json`): Add "BigQuery migration complexity" (high/high) with mitigation: "**No automated AWS analytics target** — engage **AWS account team** and/or **data analytics migration partner** before architecture or cost commitments; plugin does not prescribe Athena/Redshift/Glue."

## Part 3: Success Metrics

### Per-Service Metrics

For each service in `aws-design.json`, define:

| Metric       | Target                                           | Measurement                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime                                     | CloudWatch synthetic monitoring |
| Latency      | Within 10% of GCP baseline                       | P50, P95, P99 response times    |
| Error rate   | < 0.1%                                           | CloudWatch error metrics        |
| Cost         | Within 15% of `estimation-infra.json` projection | AWS Cost Explorer weekly        |

### Overall Migration Metrics

| Metric             | Target                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Data integrity     | 100% — zero data loss confirmed by checksums |
| Migration timeline | Within 2 weeks of planned schedule           |
| Rollback success   | Tested and confirmed < 1 hour RTO            |
| Team confidence    | Go/No-Go passed at each phase gate           |

## Part 4: Rollback Procedures

### Trigger Conditions

Initiate rollback if ANY of:

- Data integrity issues detected during validation (checksum mismatch)
- Performance regression > 20% vs GCP baseline (P95 latency)
- Error rate > 1% sustained for 15 minutes
- Cost overrun > 50% vs `estimation-infra.json` projections
- Critical AWS service limitation discovered that blocks functionality

### Per-Phase Rollback

| Phase                | Rollback Action                                    | RTO          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Setup (1-2)          | Delete AWS resources; no impact                    | < 1 hour     |
| PoC (3-4)            | Tear down PoC cluster; GCP unaffected              | < 1 hour     |
| Infrastructure (5-7) | Tear down AWS clusters; GCP still primary          | < 2 hours    |
| Data Migration (8-9) | Stop replication; GCP data is authoritative        | < 30 minutes |
| Cutover (10-11)      | Reverse DNS to GCP; resume GCP traffic             | < 1 hour     |
| Post-Cutover (12+)   | Manual restore from backup; GCP resources archived | 2-4 hours    |

### Rollback Procedure (Pre-DNS Cutover)

1. Pause dual-write replication
2. Reverse DNS records (AWS to GCP endpoints)
3. Verify GCP services receiving traffic
4. Shut down AWS workloads (keep for 1 week as standby)
5. Monitor GCP for 24 hours
6. Post-mortem: document what triggered rollback

### Rollback Procedure (Post-DNS Cutover)

1. If within 48 hours: Reverse DNS, resume GCP from replicated state
2. If beyond 48 hours: Restore GCP from backup (2-4 hour RTO)
3. Validate data integrity after restore
4. Resume GCP operations
5. Post-mortem and reassess migration approach

## Part 6: Go/No-Go Framework

Each phase gate requires explicit approval before proceeding.

### Phase Gate Criteria

| Gate | Phase Transition             | Go Criteria                                                     | No-Go Action              |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| G1   | Setup → PoC                  | VPC online, IAM configured, connectivity verified               | Fix infrastructure issues |
| G2   | PoC → Full Deploy            | PoC cluster healthy, latency acceptable, costs tracking         | Reassess architecture     |
| G3   | Full Deploy → Data Migration | All clusters deployed, integration tests passing                | Debug failing clusters    |
| G4   | Data Migration → Cutover     | Replication lag < 1s, data integrity confirmed, rollback tested | Fix replication issues    |
| G5   | Cutover → Validation         | DNS switched, traffic flowing, error rate < 0.1%                | Execute rollback          |
| G6   | Validation → Cleanup         | 1 week stable operation, costs within 15% of estimate           | Extend monitoring period  |

## Part 7: Post-Migration Monitoring

### 30-Day Post-Migration Plan

**Week 1 (Days 1-7)**: Intensive monitoring

- Check all CloudWatch dashboards every 4 hours
- Compare latency/throughput to GCP baseline daily
- Review AWS costs daily vs projections
- Maintain GCP hot standby

**Week 2 (Days 8-14)**: Stabilization

- Reduce monitoring frequency to twice daily
- Begin decommissioning GCP hot standby (read-only mode)
- Address any performance tuning items
- Validate backup/restore procedures on AWS

**Weeks 3-4 (Days 15-30)**: Optimization

- Implement cost optimization opportunities from `estimation-infra.json`
- Right-size instances based on actual usage data
- Enable Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for stable workloads
- Archive GCP resources and begin teardown
- Final cost reconciliation: actual vs projected

## Part 8: Decision Tree

### Cutover Decision Flowchart

```
START: All clusters deployed?
  NO → Continue infrastructure deployment
  YES → Data replication active?
    NO → Start data migration
    YES → Replication lag < 1 second?
      NO → Wait for replication to catch up
      YES → All integration tests passing?
        NO → Fix failing tests
        YES → Rollback procedure tested?
          NO → Execute rollback drill
          YES → READY FOR CUTOVER
            → Execute cutover per strategy
            → Monitor 24-48 hours
            → Error rate < 0.1%?
              NO → EXECUTE ROLLBACK
              YES → CUTOVER SUCCESSFUL
                → Begin 30-day monitoring
                → Plan GCP teardown (Week 14)
```

## Completion Handoff Gate (Fail Closed)

Before returning control to `generate.md`, require:

- `generation-infra.json` exists and passes the Output Validation Checklist above.

If this gate fails: STOP and output: "generate-infra did not produce a valid `generation-infra.json`; do not continue Generate Stage 2."

## Generate Phase Integration

The parent orchestrator (`generate.md`) uses `generation-infra.json` to:

1. Gate Stage 2 artifact generation — `generate-artifacts-infra.md` requires this file
2. Provide timeline context to `generate-artifacts-docs.md` for MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
3. Set phase completion status in `.phase-status.json`
