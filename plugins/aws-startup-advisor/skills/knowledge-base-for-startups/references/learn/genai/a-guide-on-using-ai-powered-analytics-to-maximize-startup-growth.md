## What are AI analytics?

AI data analytics is an advanced form of business intelligence that uses logic and reasoning—similar to human thinking—to analyze data at scale and at a level of complexity that traditional tools often can't support.

These AI-powered solutions rely on technologies such as machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing to automate processes that previously required significant human intervention.

For example, you can use image recognition with neural networks to analyze MRI scans in healthcare, saving clinicians time and improving diagnostic accuracy. When leveraging AWS, you can tap into services like [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), a platform which helps build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. SageMaker simplifies the entire machine-learning workflow, from data labeling to model deployment.

AI analytics can quickly generate deep insights to enhance your startup's decision-making. By integrating with other AWS services, such as [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) for conversational interfaces or [Amazon Forecast](https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/) for time-series forecasting, you can unlock new growth opportunities while reducing costs and speeding up innovation.

## 4 key categories of AI-powered analytics

The analytics capabilities of any AI-powered analytics solution are first and foremost determined by the underlying AI model powering it.

The models used to create AI analytics solutions typically fall into one of the following four categories:

### 1. Machine learning

While machine learning (ML) algorithms can be either supervised or unsupervised in their design, unsupervised machine learning analytics often offer the most significant impact regarding time savings, efficiency, and overall value.

It's common for unsupervised machine learning to be used to identify hidden patterns in the datasets being analyzed. (This can include new patterns that your startup hasn't recognized or even named on your own.)

**How AWS can help startups implement:**

- Take a cybersecurity startup, as an example. It can use [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to analyze network traffic data in near real-time, identifying anomalies that may indicate security breaches.
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) provides a fully managed platform for building, training, and deploying ML models at scale.
- [Amazon Personalize](https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/): Helps create real-time, personalized user recommendations, which can be invaluable for e-commerce or media startups looking to boost engagement and conversions.
- **ML workflows and MLOps**: AWS offers managed tools (e.g., Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor) to automate performance tracking and alert you when models drift and require retraining.

### 2. Knowledge-based and reasoning methods

This analytics model generates insights and conclusions from data based on constraints established by if/then logic rules and reasoning based on an existing knowledge base.

This AI analytics approach aims to structure insights and reasoning within established parameters in order to achieve greater speed and consistency, as well as help human analysts instead of attempting to apply constraint-based reasoning independently. This approach can easily be applied when a chatbot system assists with customer support. Using knowledge bases about products and services, chatbots can respond to customer queries quickly and consistently.

**How AWS can help startups implement:**

- Amazon Lex lets startups build conversational AI interfaces like chatbots and voice assistants. By integrating your existing knowledge base, you can handle customer queries at scale.
- Triggered on-demand, [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) can run logic checks or fetch data from a knowledge repository to provide consistent, up-to-date responses in real-time.
- You can automate and have serverless orchestration for modern applications with [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).

### 3. Decision-making algorithms

A decision-making algorithm is designed to analyze data and generate insights in alignment with a decision that a human user will need to make. It leverages data-driven techniques like machine learning to process information, and recommend actions or choices consistent with predefined objectives.

Decision-making algorithms are often engineered to identify a recommended decision or provide a quantitative score to inform the final choice. For instance, a fintech startup can develop a credit scoring algorithm to evaluate the credit risk of loan applicants.

**How AWS can help startups implement:**

- A fintech startup aiming to evaluate loan applications more accurately could integrate [Amazon Fraud Detector](https://aws.amazon.com/fraud-detector/) into its platform, automating the risk assessment process.
- [Amazon Forecast](https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/): Delivers time-series forecasts by automatically examining historical data. This can be useful for inventory planning, revenue projections, or supply chain management.
- Amazon Fraud Detector: Uses ML to identify potentially fraudulent activity.
- Combining multiple AWS services: You can centralize data analysis and streamline decision-making by integrating Amazon Forecast or Fraud Detector with AWS data tools like Amazon Redshift or Amazon S3.

### 4. Search methods and optimization theory

This AI analytics model draws insights from a large dataset to propose possible solutions to a given problem. The problem sets up constraints to guide the AI search process as it attempts to find an optimal solution.

Search methods and optimization theory are often used to identify more efficient, productive, or high-performing strategies. Improving energy efficiency, resource allocation, and customer outcomes are all possible goals of using this AI analytics approach.

**How AWS can help startups implement:**

- A logistics startup could integrate **AWS IoT** for real-time vehicle tracking and **Amazon EMR** to process massive amounts of route data.
- [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/): An intelligent search service that uses ML to deliver highly accurate search results from internal documents or knowledge repositories.
- [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/): For startups that rely on sensor data (logistics, manufacturing, or energy solutions), AWS IoT services feed real-time metrics into your optimization algorithms.

## 5 considerations when choosing an AI analytics approach

The best-fit AI analytics solution will not be the same for every use case. When choosing an AI model to support your analytics, you should evaluate these solutions across four key factors affecting the performance of that model and its value to your organization over time:

### 1. Scalable analytics integrity

While the technology powering AI analytics is theoretically easy to scale, the use case for the analytics and the datasets used may affect its scalability and create limitations or complications when using this solution.

For example, a model using knowledge-based and reasoning methods may experience growth pains when new customers, data points, and knowledge are incorporated into the solution. If the analytics aren't properly re-trained, this can alter the quality and accuracy of the analytic insights.

### 2. Processing efficiency

The more supervision, engineering, and management required by AI analytics, the less efficient it becomes. Human oversight may be a necessary resource commitment in many different use cases, like adhering to regulatory compliance or avoiding bias. Still, this involvement will create additional time and labor costs that will impact the efficiency of your analytics investment.

### 3. Accuracy and precision

The engineering of an AI model, its predictive capabilities, and its incidence rate of data errors all impact the overall accuracy of its insights. Certain AI analytics instances may experience a higher degree of error than others.

Unsupervised machine learning, for example, achieves efficiencies by minimizing the oversight of a human analyst, but this may come at the risk of generating less accurate insights. Consider data quality assurance, algorithm selection, and continuous monitoring for precision and efficiency.

You can implement [Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) to check for model drift and data issues. Ensuring data quality at the outset—plus continuous tuning—helps maintain high accuracy in your AI-driven decisions.

### 4. Data privacy

Before implementing an AI analytics solution, examine its data privacy policy. Your startup should understand precisely how the third-party provider collects, processes, and stores this information.

You may also want to evaluate which data types are permissible to share with the analytics solution. In some cases, restrictions on the types of data you're willing to share may impact the utility of this technology.

Address data privacy from day one. Consider:

- **Encryption:** Use [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) to encrypt data at rest. Transport Layer Security (TLS) handles data encryption in transit.
- **Identity and access management:** [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and [AWS Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) let you define fine-grained permissions.
