## Version 0.0.6 - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Configurable embedding model per client via the `--model <name>` CLI flag and `CDS_MCP_MODEL` environment variable
- Capire-versioned embeddings with local manifest resolution
- Per-chunk metadata in `searchMarkdownDocs` output

### Changed

- Changed the default embedding model from `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Switched to CAP AI SQLite `VECTOR_EMBEDDING`
- Improved `search_docs` query param description
- Replaced background model polling and `CDS_MCP_REFRESH_MS` with request-driven model and configuration refresh

### Fixed

- Blank `Cache-Control`/`Pragma` so conditional GET can 304, avoiding a full re-download of the embeddings bundle on every startup
- Isolated project model caches and CAP compiler/global state across requests
- Preserved transitive model imports for explicitly trusted direct CLI projects
- Prevented rejected MCP model compilations from exposing out-of-root diagnostics
- Refreshed cached models after changes to CAP project configuration
- Restricted MCP model access to advertised workspace roots, including symlink and resolved-source validation
