# Investigation Playbooks

Step-by-step playbooks for common production incident types. Each playbook uses
Honeycomb MCP tools in a structured sequence.

## Playbook: Latency Spike

**Trigger**: Alert fires for elevated P99 latency or user reports slowness.

1. **Prime context**: `get_workspace_context` -> `find_columns` for target dataset
2. **Characterize**: `run_query` with `HEATMAP(duration_ms), P99(duration_ms) WHERE is_root GROUP BY name`
   - Is it affecting all endpoints or specific ones?
   - Is it a gradual increase or sudden jump?
3. **BubbleUp on the slow region**: `run_bubbleup` on the heatmap outlier area
   - Look for: deployment version, region, specific endpoint, database query
4. **Trace analysis**: `get_trace` on a slow trace from the affected population
   - Where does the time go? Which span is disproportionately slow?
   - Is it a single slow dependency or cumulative slowness?
5. **Compare**: Query the suspected cause
   - `P99(duration_ms) WHERE [bubbleup finding] GROUP BY name`
   - Confirm by negation: `WHERE NOT [bubbleup finding]`
6. **Record**: `create_board` with key queries and findings

**Expected outcome**: Identified which deployment, service, or endpoint is responsible for the latency increase. A healthy trace waterfall shows spans nested tightly with minimal gaps; large gaps may indicate missing instrumentation.

## Playbook: Error Surge

**Trigger**: Error rate alert, increased exception volume, or user error reports.

1. **Prime context**: `get_workspace_context` -> `get_environment` -> `get_dataset_columns` (or
   `find_columns`) for the target environment/dataset. Do not assume `event.name`,
   `meta.signal_type`, `meta.annotation_type`, or trace fields exist.
2. **Measure failed operations**: `run_query` with `COUNT WHERE error = true`, grouped by
   `service.name`, route, and low-cardinality error category/`exception.slug`.
3. **Find exception event rows**: run a separate query with
   `event.name = "exception"`, `exception.type exists`, and `trace.trace_id exists`; include
   `meta.signal_type = "log"` when that discovered column exists. Break down by
   `service.name`, `exception.type`, and `trace.trace_id`. For legacy span-event exceptions,
   also check `name = "exception"` with `meta.signal_type = "trace"`.
   - Is it one exception type or many?
   - Are event rows new or pre-existing but increased?
4. **Find affected scope**: query failed spans and exception events separately; do not assume
   exception fields on the containing span. Use `exception.message` primarily in samples or
   targeted queries, not as the default high-cardinality grouping.
5. **BubbleUp on the right population**: use failed spans for operation-level causes; use the
   exception-event query for diagnostic event differences.
6. **Trace an exception**: extract a sampled `trace.trace_id` from the exception event row and
   call `get_trace(environment_slug, trace_id, show_events=true, view_mode="full")`.
   - The event row is authoritative for `exception.*`, `event.name`, body, severity, and parent ID.
   - `get_trace` is authoritative for placement and surrounding span structure.
7. **Verify fix scope**: query both the operation-failure population and the exception-event
   population to confirm the pattern.

## Playbook: Deployment Regression

**Trigger**: Issues observed after a deployment.

1. **Prime context**: `find_columns` — look for deployment-related fields
2. **Compare versions**: `P99(duration_ms), COUNT WHERE is_root GROUP BY deployment.version`
   - Does the new version show different latency or error patterns?
3. **BubbleUp comparing versions**: `run_bubbleup` with group selection on new version
   - What's different about the new version's behavior?
4. **Narrow to affected operations**: Add WHERE filters from BubbleUp
   - Which specific operations are affected?
5. **Trace comparison**: `get_trace` on traces from both versions
   - What changed in the span structure or timing?

## Playbook: Dependency Failure

**Trigger**: Downstream service or database issues suspected.

1. **Check architecture**: `get_service_map` to understand service dependencies
2. **Check dependency health**: `P99(duration_ms), COUNT WHERE service.name = "[dependency]" GROUP BY name`
   - Is the dependency slower or erroring more?
3. **Impact assessment**: `COUNT WHERE any.service.name = "[dependency]" AND any.error = true GROUP BY root.name`
   - Which upstream services and endpoints are affected?
4. **Trace through the dependency**: `get_trace` on an affected trace
   - Is it timeout, error, or slow response?
   - Are retries visible (repeated child spans)?
5. **Isolate**: Confirm dependency is the cause
   - `P99(duration_ms) WHERE child.service.name = "[dependency]" GROUP BY name`

## Playbook: SLO Budget Burn

**Trigger**: SLO burn alert fires or budget consumption rate increasing.

1. **Check SLO status**: `get_slos` with the SLO ID for detailed compliance, budget, and burn rate
2. **Identify timing**: When did the burn rate increase? Use the budget burndown graph.
3. **Find contributing failures**: Run the SLI query with error groupings
   - If latency SLO: `COUNT WHERE duration_ms > [SLI threshold] GROUP BY name, service.name`
   - If availability SLO: `COUNT WHERE http.status_code >= 500 GROUP BY name, service.name`
4. **BubbleUp on failures**: `run_bubbleup` to find what differentiates failing events
5. **Trace failing events**: `get_trace` on representative failures
6. **Quantify impact**: How much budget was consumed and by what?

## Playbook: General Health Check

**Trigger**: User wants a broad overview of production health.

1. **Prime context**: `get_workspace_context` -> `get_environment`
2. **Check SLOs**: `get_slos` — any SLOs triggered or budgets low?
3. **Check triggers**: `get_triggers` — any active alerts?
4. **Architecture overview**: `get_service_map` — any unusual traffic patterns?
5. **Error scan**: `COUNT WHERE error = true GROUP BY service.name` (last 2 hours)
6. **Latency scan**: `P99(duration_ms) WHERE is_root GROUP BY name` (last 2 hours)
7. **Traffic scan**: `COUNT WHERE is_root GROUP BY http.route` (last 2 hours vs last 24 hours)
8. **Report**: Summarize findings, flag any anomalies
