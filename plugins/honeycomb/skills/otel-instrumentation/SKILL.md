# OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for Honeycomb

SDK setup, custom spans, attributes, span events, sampling, and layered telemetry.
For conceptual foundations (why wide events matter, how attributes connect to
investigation), see the **observability-fundamentals** skill.

## OTLP Configuration and SDK Setup

Every OTel SDK needs these environment variables to send data to Honeycomb:

### Required Environment Variables

**Base configuration:**
```bash
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=your-service-name
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

**Optional but recommended:**
```bash
# Protocol selection (default: http/protobuf)
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf  # or grpc

# Signal-specific endpoints (override base endpoint for specific signals)
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/metrics
```

**For metrics (required if sending metrics):**
```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY,x-honeycomb-dataset=YOUR_DATASET"
```

### Protocol Selection

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` determines the wire format and transport:
- `http/protobuf` (default, recommended) — HTTP with protobuf encoding
- `grpc` — gRPC with protobuf encoding
- `http/json` — HTTP with JSON encoding (larger payload, slower)

Use `http/protobuf` unless you have specific infrastructure requirements for gRPC.

### Signal-Specific Endpoints

By default, OTel SDKs append `/v1/traces` and `/v1/metrics` to `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
Use signal-specific endpoint vars to override:
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` — full URL for traces (including `/v1/traces`)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` — full URL for metrics (including `/v1/metrics`)

Useful when routing signals to different backends or using non-standard endpoints.

### Common Pitfalls

**Silent auth failure:** The OTLP exporters need the `x-honeycomb-team` header to
authenticate. Without it, Honeycomb silently rejects requests — no error, no data. Set
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY"` or pass headers
programmatically. If loading the key from `.env`, ensure dotenv runs before SDK init.

**Metrics dataset header:** Honeycomb requires `x-honeycomb-dataset` on the metrics OTLP
endpoint to route metrics correctly. Without it, metrics are silently dropped. Traces do
not need this header (they route by `service.name`). Set via
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY,x-honeycomb-dataset=YOUR_DATASET"`.

For the env var values, language-specific dependencies, and setup code (Go, Python,
Node.js, Java, Ruby, .NET, Rust), see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/sdk-setup-by-language.md`.

## Custom Instrumentation

### Adding Attributes to Existing Spans (Highest Impact)

Add business context to auto-instrumented spans — no new spans needed. Get the current
span from context and call `SetAttributes` (Go), `set_attribute` (Python), or
`setAttribute` (Node.js) with user, tenant, business, and deployment context.

### Creating Custom Spans

Wrap important business operations for visibility in the trace waterfall. Use
`tracer.Start(ctx, "operation-name")` (Go), `tracer.start_as_current_span("operation-name")`
(Python), or `tracer.startActiveSpan("operation-name", callback)` (Node.js).

For full code examples in all languages, consult
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/custom-instrumentation.md`.

## When to Create a Span

Not every function needs a span. Two questions determine whether a span is worth creating:

1. **Is it interesting?** — Does the work meaningfully impact performance (latency or
   failures) for the overall request?
2. **Is it aggregable?** — If you group this span by name and attributes, will it produce
   useful trends and comparisons?

| Operation | Interesting? | Aggregable? | Create a Span? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| HTTP request handler | Yes — variable latency, can fail | Yes — group by route, method, status | **Yes** |
| Database query | Yes — I/O bound, failure-prone | Yes — group by query type, table | **Yes** |
| External API call | Yes — network latency, dependencies | Yes — group by endpoint, status | **Yes** |
| Cache lookup | Yes — fast vs slow path | Yes — group by cache name, hit/miss | **Yes** |
| Message queue pub/consume | Yes — async boundary, delays | Yes — group by queue, message type | **Yes** |
| Business logic transaction | Yes — meaningful state change | Yes — group by type, outcome | **Yes** |
| Private helper function | No — trivial CPU, predictable | No — too granular | **No** |
| Loop iteration | Maybe — if slow | No — unbounded cardinality | **No** |
| Getter/setter | No — no meaningful duration | No — nothing to group by | **No** |
| Input validation (pure CPU) | No — fast, predictable | Maybe | **No** |
| Business logic orchestration | No — just calls instrumented code | No — duration is sum of children | **No** |

**Common mistakes:**
- **Too many spans**: A trace with millions of 2ms spans is far too detailed and rarely
  actionable. Roll them up — combine into a single span, or capture the detail as an
  attribute on the parent span instead.
- **Too few spans**: Collapsing hours of work into a single opaque handler leaves you
  guessing about where time is spent.

When in doubt, prefer **attributes on existing spans** over creating new child spans.

#### Timing Attributes (measure sub-operations without child spans)

Record important sub-operation durations as attributes on the parent span. These are
easier to query than child spans and work directly with BubbleUp.

```go
// Go: time auth and record on the existing span
span := trace.SpanFromContext(r.Context())
authStart := time.Now()
user, err := authenticate(r)
span.SetAttributes(attribute.Float64("auth.duration_ms", float64(time.Since(authStart).Milliseconds())))
```

```python
# Python: time auth and record on the existing span
span = trace.get_current_span()
auth_start = time.monotonic()
user = authenticate(request)
span.set_attribute("auth.duration_ms", (time.monotonic() - auth_start) * 1000)
```

#### Exception Slugs (tag each error site with a static identifier)

Tag each error throw site with a unique static string (`exception.slug`). This creates
a low-cardinality, greppable identifier that connects dashboards directly to code.

```go
// Go: static slug — greppable, safe for GROUP BY
span.SetAttributes(
    attribute.String("exception.slug", "err-stripe-charge-failed"),
    attribute.Bool("error", true),
)
span.RecordError(err)
```

```python
# Python: static slug — greppable, safe for GROUP BY
span.set_attribute("exception.slug", "err-stripe-card-error")
span.set_attribute("error", True)
span.record_exception(e)
```

Find unhandled errors (missing slugs): `WHERE error = true AND exception.slug does-not-exist`.

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/custom-instrumentation.md`.

## What to Instrument

### High Value (Instrument First)
- API entry points (HTTP handlers, gRPC methods)
- Database queries (auto-instrumented by most SDKs)
- External HTTP calls (auto-instrumented by most SDKs)
- Message queue producers/consumers

These are typically auto-instrumented by OTel SDKs and form the skeleton of your traces.

### Medium Value (Add Next)
- Business logic operations (checkout, payment, fulfillment)
- Cache operations (hits, misses, evictions)
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Background job execution

These are your business logic. Without custom spans here, you can see that a request was
slow but not *why* — the trace waterfall has gaps where the important work happens
invisibly.

### Attributes to Add

Attributes are the dimensions BubbleUp uses during investigations. Every attribute you
add is a new axis BubbleUp can diff on to find what's different about outlier requests.
For the complete catalog organized by category with rationale and example queries, see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/wide-event-attributes.md`.

For why attributes matter conceptually, see the **observability-fundamentals** skill.

## Span Events and Span Links

- **Span events**: Record point-in-time occurrences within a span (errors, retries, state
  changes). Use `span.add_event("event_name", {attributes})`.
- **Span links**: Connect spans across different trace hierarchies (async processing,
  fan-out/fan-in, cross-system correlation). Create a `Link` to the related span context.

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/custom-instrumentation.md`
for full examples of both patterns.

## Sampling

### Sampling Strategy

Sampling is about tradeoffs — there is no free lunch:

- **Head sampling favors cost over debuggability.** You save resources, but a 0.1% error
  at 1% sampling becomes effectively invisible. Head sampling is oblivious to what
  happens downstream.
- **Tail sampling favors fidelity over simplicity.** You keep interesting traces but need
  infrastructure (Refinery or Collector) to buffer and evaluate complete traces.

The math matters: if an error occurs 0.1% of the time and you head-sample at 1%, you'll
capture roughly 1 in 100,000 of those errors. At moderate traffic, that error may never
appear in your data.

### Head Sampling (SDK-level)
Decides whether to sample a trace at creation time. Simple but can miss interesting traces.
- Configure via `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` env var
- `always_on` (default), `always_off`, `traceidratio` (e.g., sample 10%)
- `parentbased_traceidratio` respects parent sampling decisions
- **Best for:** Very high-throughput services where you can tolerate missing rare events

### Tail Sampling (Collector/Refinery)
Decides after the trace is complete. Keeps interesting traces (errors, slow requests).
- Use Honeycomb's **Refinery** for production tail sampling
- Or configure the OTel Collector's `tail_sampling` processor
- Can sample based on: latency, error status, specific attributes, trace duration
- **Best for:** Services where debuggability matters — keeps errors and outliers while
  sampling routine traffic

### Sampling Impact on Honeycomb
- Sampling reduces data volume and cost
- SLOs, BubbleUp, and query results adjust for sampling rate automatically
- Trace completeness may be affected — missing spans if not all services sample consistently
- Start with no sampling, then add as needed for cost management

## Layered Telemetry

OpenTelemetry is "trace-first" — context propagation is the glue that correlates all
signals. But effective observability layers multiple signal types for different purposes.

A three-question test for choosing the right signal:

1. **What needs causality and full-request context?** → Traces (spans)
2. **What needs inexpensive long-term storage and fast alerting?** → Metrics
3. **What is rare vs. common, and what are the audit requirements?** → Logs / events

**The histogram-alongside-spans pattern:** For high-throughput HTTP services, emit both a
span and a histogram metric for each handled request. This lets you head-sample traces
for cost while histograms provide last-ditch alerting — and exemplars link outlier metric
points back to specific traces for deeper investigation.

The technique is *layering* (not duplication) because each signal provides a different
view at a different level of detail.

For architectural patterns where layering is essential (streaming, async jobs, ETL), see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/architectural-patterns.md`.

For AWS Lambda-specific patterns — choosing between the AWS Managed OTel Layer
and manual SDK setup, forceFlush, SDK 2.x setup, cross-Lambda trace propagation,
header normalisation, TOKEN vs REQUEST authorizers — see
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/otel-instrumentation/references/lambda.md`.

## Logs in Honeycomb

OTel can send logs too. If you have existing log infrastructure, the OTel Collector can
ingest logs and forward them to Honeycomb as structured events:

- **OTel SDK log bridge**: Captures logs from your existing logging library (`slog` in Go,
  `logging` in Python, `winston`/`pino` in Node.js) and exports them as OTel log records.
- **OTel Collector `filelog` receiver**: Reads log files, parses them, exports as OTLP.

Logs sent through OTel arrive in Honeycomb as structured events with the same query
capabilities as spans.

## Naming Conventions

- **Span names**: Describe the operation (`HTTP GET /api/users`, `db.query SELECT`, `process-payment`)
- **Attribute names**: Use dot-separated namespaces (`user.id`, `order.total`, `cache.hit`)
- **Follow OTel semantic conventions** where applicable (`http.method`, `db.system`, `rpc.service`)
- **Custom attributes**: Use your own namespace (`app.`, `checkout.`, `mycompany.`)
