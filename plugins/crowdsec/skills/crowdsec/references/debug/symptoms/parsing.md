# Debug — Logs not being parsed

Canonical docs: <https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/troubleshooting/intro> · `cscli metrics` <https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/observability/cscli_metrics>

Commands below are written for **bare-metal** (`sudo cscli …`). In docker,
prefix with `docker exec <name>`; in k8s, `kubectl exec -n <ns> <pod> --`.

The single diagnostic that answers "is parsing working" is **`cscli metrics
show acquisition`**. It prints,
per source: Lines read / parsed / unparsed / poured to bucket / whitelisted.

## Read the table first

Example output:

```
| Source                 | Lines read | Lines parsed | Lines unparsed |
| appsec:appsec          | 4          | 4            | -              |
| file:/var/log/auth.log | 49         | -            | 49             |
| file:/var/log/syslog   | 1          | -            | 1              |
```

Map the symptom to the cause:

| What the row shows | Meaning | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| **Source absent entirely** | acquisition never matched the file/journald unit | acquisition config / perms (below) |
| **0 lines read** | source matched but nothing arrives — file empty, wrong path, journald perms, container can't see the path | reachability (below) |
| **Lines read, 0 parsed, all unparsed** | lines arrive but no parser claims them | **usually normal noise** — or a `type:` mismatch (below) |
| **Read = parsed** | parsing fine; if no alerts the problem is downstream → [no-alerts.md](./no-alerts.md) |

The 49/49 row above is the typical case — `auth.log` carries `sudo`/`cron`/
`systemd-logind` lines no parser claims. Treat unparsed as a fault only when
**lines you know should match** (a real `sshd: Failed password …`, an nginx
access line) don't move the parsed counter.

## Confirm with `cscli explain` (read-only, no traffic needed)

This is the fastest way to prove a parser claims a line and which `type:` it
needs:

```bash
LINE='May 18 10:00:00 host sshd[123]: Failed password for root from 203.0.113.5 port 22 ssh2'

sudo cscli explain --log "$LINE" --type syslog     # → green ssh-bf scenarios
sudo cscli explain --log "$LINE" --type nginx      # → 🔴 parser failure
```

Same line, different `--type`: `syslog` parses to the ssh scenarios; `nginx` is
a hard parser failure. **The `type:` label in your acquisition must match the
parser family**, exactly as `--type` does here. Use `--file <path>` to replay a
whole log file; add `--only-successful-parsers` when replaying a whole file to
hide the long list of parsers that legitimately reject each line and surface
only the ones that matched (the default output is very noisy on a real log).

## The #1 real cause: `type:` label vs installed parser

Acquisition files set `labels: { type: <x> }`. A parser only runs on events
whose `type` it expects. Mismatch = lines read, 0 parsed.

```bash
sudo grep -r 'type:' /etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/        # what you declared
sudo cscli parsers list                              # what's installed/enabled
```

- nginx/apache access logs → need `crowdsecurity/nginx` / `apache2` collection,
  acquisition `type: nginx` (or the right syslog program tag).
- sshd → `crowdsecurity/sshd`, `type: syslog` reading `/var/log/auth.log`.
- A source with `type: syslog` but only file-format lines (no syslog prefix)
  won't match the syslog parser — check with `cscli explain`.

## Collection installed but no source feeds it

The inverse, high-signal case — and the reason a webserver "isn't detected" even
though its collection is enabled. If the source row is **entirely absent** from
`cscli metrics show acquisition` (not 0 parsed — *no row at all*), CrowdSec never
reads that service's logs, so nothing downstream can ever fire.

```bash
sudo cscli collections list                          # e.g. crowdsecurity/nginx enabled?
sudo grep -r 'type:' /etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/         # is there a `type: nginx` source?
```

Collection enabled but no matching `type:` = guaranteed dead end. The classic
cause: the service was installed **after** `cscli setup` ran — `cscli setup`
only detects services running at that moment, so a later-added nginx never got an
acquisition file. Fix either way:

- Add an `acquis.d/*.yaml` with the right `filenames:` + `type:`. Mind
  **non-default log paths** — e.g. nginx configured to log to
  `/var/log/nginx/access-custom.log` instead of `access.log`; point at the path
  nginx actually writes (`grep -rE 'access_log|log_format' /etc/nginx/`).
- Or re-run `cscli setup detect` then `cscli setup install-acquisition`. Re-running
  **appends** and does not dedupe — afterwards audit `acquis.d/` for the same path
  appearing twice (double-counted events → premature bans).

## Reachability (when 0 lines read)

- **File perms**: the `crowdsec` user must read the file. `sudo -u crowdsec head
  <path>` — if that fails, it's perms (or SELinux/AppArmor, or — in a
  container/k8s — the path isn't mounted in). Platform-specific causes are
  collected in [../common/platform-gotchas.md](../common/platform-gotchas.md).
- **journald**: source must be in a group that can read the journal; a
  file-source migration to journald silently reads nothing otherwise.

## Multi-stage chains

Parsing is staged (`s00` → `s01` → `s02-enrich`). A line can be parsed at s01
then dropped/whitelisted at `s02-enrich` (e.g. `crowdsecurity/whitelists` at
`/etc/crowdsec/parsers/s02-enrich/whitelists.yaml`). If "parsed" is
non-zero but "whitelisted" is also non-zero and alerts are missing, the issue is
a whitelist, not parsing → [no-alerts.md](./no-alerts.md).

## Fix path

- Missing parser for a real source → install the hub collection
  (`cscli collections install crowdsecurity/<svc>`), then
  `sudo systemctl reload crowdsec`. Authoring a custom parser is **out of scope
  for this skill**.
- Wrong `type:` or newly added source → edit the acquisition file, then run the
  validate → reload → verify loop:

  ```bash
  sudo crowdsec -t                          # validate config (exit 0 = OK)
  sudo systemctl reload crowdsec            # reload also re-runs -t first
  sudo cscli metrics show acquisition       # source of truth: new row, Lines read/parsed > 0
  ```

  `crowdsec -t` is the config validator and `cscli metrics show acquisition` is
  the source of truth for whether a source is actually read.

> **Self-test caveat:** a request you generate from `127.0.0.1` is whitelisted by
> `crowdsecurity/whitelists`, so its row shows `Lines parsed == Lines whitelisted`
> and **no decision** — that still proves the pipeline is wired. A real ban needs
> a public source IP (genuine attacker traffic, or test from off-box / mobile data).
