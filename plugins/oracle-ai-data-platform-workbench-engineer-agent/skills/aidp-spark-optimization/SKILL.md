# Spark Optimization

Field-tested techniques for optimizing **open-source Apache Spark 3.5.0** (and open-source Delta Lake) workloads. Every technique lists what it does, why it matters, **patterns** (when it helps), **anti-patterns** (when it does not help or hurts), the exact config/code, and impact evidence from real reproductions.

Applies to plain OSS Spark 3.5.0. Vendor-only features (Databricks Photon / predictive optimization / Delta disk cache, AWS Glue/EMR runtime tricks) are excluded or explicitly flagged. (Note: Delta Lake liquid clustering, OPTIMIZE/ZORDER, deletion vectors, CDF are open-source — GA in Delta 3.2.0 — see `references/08-delta-lake.md`.) Some examples run on the Oracle AI Data Platform (AIDP); AIDP-specific execution rules are in `references/aidp-notes.md`.

## Core principle

> **Optimization is a measurement loop, not a guess.** Detect → diagnose → propose → apply → re-run on the same data → compare the same metrics.

Most Spark time is lost to **moving data** (shuffle), **waiting on a straggler** (skew), **spilling** (under-memory), **doing redundant work** (re-reads, re-materialization, repeated actions), or **per-row execution overhead** (wide codegen). Almost every win below reduces one of those.

## When to use

- A job/notebook is slow, missing an SLA, or its cost is too high.
- Spark UI shows: a single slow stage, task `p100/p50 > 2x` skew, large shuffle read/write, memory/disk spill, high GC, or thousands of tiny tasks/files.
- You see code smells: `union` of the same table, a driver loop calling `collect()`/`head()`/`count()` repeatedly, `MERGE` on a huge table, wide `groupBy` (100+ fields), reading 100k+ small files, an un-filtered join with a big dimension.
- You read from / write to an **Oracle database** (ADW/ATP/Exadata): a single-task JDBC read, a slow or redo-saturating multi-TB write, or unsupported array/map/struct columns. (`references/09-oracle-database.md`)
- Before launching a large ingest/transform so the cluster + configs are right the first time.

**When NOT to use:** correctness bugs (use debugging), or sub-second jobs where tuning effort exceeds the payoff. Structured Streaming *engine* tuning (trigger interval, `maxOffsetsPerTrigger`, state store) is out of scope here — but each micro-batch is batch-shaped, so the join/skew/partition/file/codegen techniques below apply per batch.

## How to find the opportunity → which reference to read

```dot
digraph route {
  rankdir=LR; node [shape=box];
  sym [shape=diamond, label="Dominant symptom?"];
  sym -> "references/diagnosis.md" [label="not sure / need to measure"];
  sym -> "references/02-joins.md" [label="slow join, skew, SortMergeJoin"];
  sym -> "references/04-memory-and-spill.md" [label="spill, OOM, lost executors, GC"];
  sym -> "references/cluster-sizing.md" [label="right-size compute: workers/OCPU/RAM"];
  sym -> "references/03-file-layout-io.md" [label="many small files, slow scan, listing"];
  sym -> "references/01-partitioning.md" [label="too many/few partitions, weak parallelism"];
  sym -> "references/05-codegen.md" [label="CPU-bound wide aggregation"];
  sym -> "references/06-caching-materialization.md" [label="re-reads, union, driver loop, MERGE"];
  sym -> "references/07-aqe.md" [label="want runtime adaptivity"];
  sym -> "references/08-delta-lake.md" [label="Delta table: small files, OPTIMIZE/ZORDER/clustering, VACUUM, deletion vectors, CDF"];
  sym -> "references/09-oracle-database.md" [label="read/write Oracle DB / ADW / Exadata (JDBC parallelism, redo, complex types)"];
}
```

Then consult `references/config-matrix.md` for the exact key, default, impact, and **where it can be set** (notebook / cluster-create-only / non-modifiable), and `references/quick-reference.md` for the impact-ranked checklist.

## The 80/20: highest-impact moves first

Ranked by typical payoff (full details + caveats in the referenced files):

1. **Eliminate avoidable shuffle on joins** — raise `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` so a small/medium side broadcasts; or **semi-join pre-filter** the big dimension down to broadcastable size. (`02-joins.md`)
2. **Fix the small-file problem** — compact sources / size output files; tune `maxPartitionBytes` + `openCostInBytes`. Listing+opening 100k+ files can cost more than the data. (`03-file-layout-io.md`)
3. **Right-size memory to stop spill** — raise `spark.memory.fraction` (cluster-create-only on AIDP) when there are no user data structures; spill to disk is a silent multiplier. (`04-memory-and-spill.md`, `cluster-sizing.md`)
4. **Address skew** — AQE skew-join, or semi-join pre-filter + broadcast; a `p100/p50 > 2x` join stage serializes the whole stage on a straggler. (`02-joins.md`, `07-aqe.md`)
5. **Avoid redundant work** — don't `union` the same table, don't loop `collect()`/`head()` on the driver, treat intermediates as views (don't materialize), prefer JOIN over MERGE for full reloads. (`06-caching-materialization.md`)
6. **Compress shuffle/spill/output with zstd** — `spark.io.compression.codec=zstd` + `spark.sql.parquet.compression.codec=zstd`: tight like gzip, fast like snappy; cuts spill-disk and output size. (`03-file-layout-io.md`)
7. **Tune parallelism** — `shuffle.partitions` ≈ 2–3× total cores for large shuffles; pair with AQE coalescing to avoid small output files. (`01-partitioning.md`)
8. **Constrain codegen on very wide aggregations** — lower `spark.sql.codegen.maxFields` when a wide `groupBy` is CPU-bound; generated code can be *slower* than the fallback. (`05-codegen.md`)

## Workflow

1. **Measure** — run the workload, collect stage metrics + task quantiles (`diagnosis.md`). On AIDP, see `aidp-notes.md` for collecting Spark UI data.
2. **Diagnose** — read `explain(True)`/the SQL plan; map the dominant symptom to a technique.
3. **Propose** — pick the technique; check `config-matrix.md` for where the config can be set.
4. **Apply** — change code or config. On a shared cluster, remember: **one SparkSession per cluster — a `spark.conf.set` leaks to other notebooks; revert it explicitly** (`aidp-notes.md`).
5. **Re-run** on the same cluster + data, prove the workload is logically identical (same rows/columns/result), and **compare the same metrics** (wall time, shuffle, spill, task skew).

## Common mistakes

- Comparing wall time of two runs that aren't logically identical (different data/cache state). Prove equivalence first.
- Reading summed task metrics as wall-clock — stage duration is start→end timestamps; cumulative task time is summed across tasks.
- Counting AQE-skipped stages as time spent.
- `repartition()` "to be safe" — it forces a shuffle; only repartition with a reason (see `01-partitioning.md`).
- Lowering AQE skew/advisory partition size so far that you create a new small-file problem.
- Setting a cluster-create-only config (e.g. `spark.memory.fraction`) from a notebook and assuming it took effect — it didn't. Verify with `spark.conf.get` / the Environment tab (`config-matrix.md`).
