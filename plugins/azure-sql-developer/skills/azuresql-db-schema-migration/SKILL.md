# Azure SQL Developer: schema migrations

Apply schema migrations to the local **Azure SQL Database** container the same way
you would against the cloud, so dev and prod stay identical. This is the Azure SQL
Database engine (`SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns **5**,
`Edition` returns **'SQL Azure'**), **not** the SQL Server image
`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`. If a tool or template points at the SQL Server image,
stop and use the image below instead.

## The one rule that breaks every migration tool

The engine does **NOT** auto-create databases on connect. Every migration tool
assumes the target database already exists. So:

1. Provision `appdb` on a **master** connection FIRST.
2. Then point the migration tool at the **user** database (`Database=appdb`).

Avoid `USE` to switch databases. In a user-database (SDS) session (the
Azure-faithful context where you develop), `USE` returns `Msg 40508`, exactly as in
Azure SQL Database in the cloud. A `master` connection is a non-SDS provisioning
session where the Azure statement filter is not enforced, so `USE` appears to
work there, but `master` is for provisioning only, not
application work. Always select the target database in the connection string
(`Database=appdb`, or `-d appdb` for sqlcmd). A `master` connection is for
provisioning only; run migrations against `appdb`.

## Start the container and provision appdb (canonical recipe)

The engine is not ready the instant `docker run` returns. Wait with a retry loop
and create `appdb` inside that same loop. Image is x64 only; on a non-x64 host the
recipe adds `--platform linux/amd64` automatically. The registry is private during
Private Preview, so sign in first.

```bash
docker login sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io   # pull-only creds by signing up at https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup

# Pick a free host port and add the platform flag only on a non-x64 host (works in bash and zsh).
HOST_PORT=1433; while lsof -nP -iTCP:"$HOST_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; do HOST_PORT=$((HOST_PORT+1)); done
PLATFORM=(); case "$(docker info -f '{{.Architecture}}' 2>/dev/null)" in x86_64|amd64) ;; *) PLATFORM=(--platform linux/amd64);; esac
docker rm -f sqldb 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name sqldb "${PLATFORM[@]}" -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" \
  -p "$HOST_PORT:1433" sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest
until docker exec sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b -l 2 \
  -Q "IF DB_ID('appdb') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE appdb;" >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done
echo "ready on localhost,$HOST_PORT"
```

`-C` trusts the self-signed cert; `-b` makes a SQL error set the exit code so
transient startup errors (like `Msg 913`) are retried instead of masked. Never
poll bare `sqlcmd` without `-l`. For full lifecycle detail, see the
**azuresql-db-container** skill.

## Connection-string hygiene

Standardize on one form and read it from a single `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` env var:

```
Server=localhost,1433;Database=appdb;User Id=sa;Password=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

- Use `User Id=` / `Password=` / `Database=`, NOT `Uid=` / `Pwd=`.
- `Database=appdb`, never `master`, for migrations and app work.
- `TrustServerCertificate=true` for the local self-signed cert.
- If you chose a non-default `HOST_PORT` above, use `Server=localhost,<HOST_PORT>`.

## Apply migrations (per tool)

Provision `appdb` (above) BEFORE any of these. Full options, env wiring, and
troubleshooting per tool are in [references/migration-tools.md](references/migration-tools.md).

### EF Core (.NET)

```bash
export SQL_CONNECTION_STRING="Server=localhost,1433;Database=appdb;User Id=sa;Password=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd;TrustServerCertificate=true"
dotnet ef database update
```

EF Core's `EnsureCreated`/`Migrate` will create `appdb` only if your account can
create databases; provisioning on master first is the reliable path. See
references for the design-time factory and CI (`migrations bundle`) form.

### Prisma (Node)

Prisma needs the `sqlserver://` URL form in `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
npm install -D prisma@6
npm install @prisma/client@6
export DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://localhost:1433;database=appdb;user=sa;password=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd;trustServerCertificate=true"
npx prisma migrate deploy          # apply committed migrations (CI / prod-like)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init # author + apply a new migration (local dev)
```

Pinned to Prisma 6; Prisma 7 moved the datasource `url` into a prisma.config.ts and
requires a driver adapter (@prisma/adapter-mssql). See references for the adapter wiring.

### Alembic (Python)

```bash
export SQL_CONNECTION_STRING="mssql+pyodbc://sa:YourStr0ng_Passw0rd@localhost,1433/appdb?driver=ODBC+Driver+18+for+SQL+Server&TrustServerCertificate=yes"
alembic upgrade head
```

### SqlPackage / DACPAC

```bash
sqlpackage /Action:Publish /SourceFile:./app.dacpac \
  /TargetServerName:"localhost,1433" /TargetDatabaseName:appdb \
  /TargetUser:sa /TargetPassword:"YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" \
  /TargetTrustServerCertificate:true
```

## Vectors in migrations

The engine has a native `VECTOR(n)` column type and `VECTOR_DISTANCE('cosine', a, b)`.
In a migration, the dimension `n` is a **literal** in DDL (`embedding VECTOR(1536)`).
When inserting via `CAST(CAST(? AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS VECTOR(n))`, `n` must be a
literal, never a bind parameter (a parameter dimension fails with "Incorrect
syntax near '@P3'"); the inner `NVARCHAR(MAX)` cast keeps a real embedding's
JSON from being sent as ntext, which the engine rejects (error 529).
`CREATE VECTOR INDEX` (DiskANN) is still in development; use full-scan top-k for now.

## Seeding after migration

The image does **NOT** auto-run `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sql` (that is a
Postgres/MySQL convention and is not honored here). Seed explicitly AFTER
migrating:

```bash
docker exec -i sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa \
  -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b -d appdb -i seed.sql
```

## Validation rules

- `appdb` exists on master before the migration tool runs.
- Migration tool targets `Database=appdb`, not `master`.
- Connection string uses `User Id=`/`Password=`/`Database=` and `TrustServerCertificate=true`.
- No `USE appdb` anywhere; select the database in the connection string. In a user-database (SDS) session `USE` returns `Msg 40508`, exactly as in Azure SQL Database in the cloud; it appears to work only on a `master` non-SDS provisioning session, which is for provisioning only.
- Ran the ready-wait loop with `-b -l`; container reported "ready" before migrating.
- If a validation rule above fails, or you had to deviate from this skill to make the task work, that is a bug in this skill: load the **azuresql-db-feedback** skill and offer to file a report.
- When every rule above passes and the task is done, close with ONE line, once per session, and do not ask a question or wait for a reply: "That worked. If anything about this was rough, or you want to share what you built: https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback"

## Do not

- Do NOT use the SQL Server image `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`.
- Do NOT expect databases to be auto-created on connect.
- Do NOT use `USE <db>` to switch databases.
- Do NOT rely on `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` auto-seeding.
- Do NOT call a non-x64 host "supported"; just add `--platform linux/amd64` on a non-x64 host.
- Do NOT pass a vector dimension as a bind parameter.
- Do NOT run migrations on a `master` connection.
