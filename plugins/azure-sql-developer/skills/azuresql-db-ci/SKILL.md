# Azure SQL Developer in CI

Run integration tests against the **Azure SQL Database engine** (Private Preview) as a CI
service container. This is the local Azure SQL engine, not the SQL Server image
`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`. `SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns **5** and
`SERVERPROPERTY('Edition')` returns **'SQL Azure'**. If a workflow was about to use the SQL Server image, stop and use this image instead.

For the full readiness loop, connection model, vectors, seeding, and registry detail, load the
**azuresql-db-container** skill.

## Load-bearing facts (inlined)

- **Image:** `sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest`
  (x64, linux/amd64). It lives in a private preview registry; the runner must sign in with
  `ACR_USERNAME` / `ACR_PASSWORD` secrets. Registry and tag are provisional during Private Preview.
- **Platform:** the image is x64 only. CI hosted runners are x64, so no
  `--platform` flag is needed there. On a non-x64 self-hosted runner, add `--platform linux/amd64`.
- **Required env:** `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` and a complex `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` (8+ chars, upper/lower/digit/
  symbol), kept in a secret. Engine listens on 1433.
- **Provision appdb first.** The engine does **NOT** auto-create databases on connect. You must
  `CREATE DATABASE appdb` on a **master** connection before anything connects with `Database=appdb`.
- **Prefer the connection string over `USE`.** Avoid `USE` to switch databases. In a user-database
  (SDS) session (the Azure-faithful context where you develop), `USE` returns `Msg 40508`, exactly as
  in Azure SQL Database in the cloud. A `master` connection is a non-SDS provisioning session where
  the Azure statement filter is not enforced, so `USE` appears to work there,
  but `master` is for provisioning only, not application work. Always select the target database in
  the connection string (`Database=appdb`, or `-d appdb` for sqlcmd).
- **master is for provisioning only.** Tests run against the user database `appdb`, never master.
- **No auto-seed.** The image does **NOT** run `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sql` (that is a
  Postgres/MySQL convention, not honored here). Seed by running `sqlcmd -d appdb -i seed.sql` after
  provisioning appdb.

## Connection string (standard)

```
Server=localhost,1433;Database=appdb;User Id=sa;Password=<MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD>;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

Use `User Id=` / `Password=` / `Database=` (not `Uid=` / `Pwd=`). For sqlcmd use `-C` to trust the
self-signed cert. The app reads this from a single `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` env var. Tests target
`appdb`, not master.

## GitHub Actions (canonical)

The service container starts the engine. Its **health check runs sqlcmd inside the container**, so
the runner needs no client tools. A separate step provisions `appdb` via `docker exec` before tests.

```

### Why these choices

- **`credentials:`** pulls from the private preview ACR using `ACR_USERNAME` / `ACR_PASSWORD`
  secrets. Without it the pull fails: the registry is private.
- **`--health-cmd` with `-l 2 -b`** waits for true readiness. `docker run` returning does not mean
  the engine is ready; `-b` retries transient SQL startup errors instead of masking them. The job
  blocks on health before steps run.
- **Provision step, not auto-create.** appdb must exist before tests open `Database=appdb`.
- **Test connection targets appdb.** master is for provisioning only.

## Required secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ACR_USERNAME` | Private preview registry sign-in (using the shared pull-only credentials provided to the Private Preview cohort; get them by signing up at https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup; they may rotate) |
| `ACR_PASSWORD` | Private preview registry sign-in |
| `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` | sa password for the engine; complex, 8+ chars |

## Adapting to other CI

- **Azure Pipelines:** there is no native `services:`. Sign in with
  `docker login sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io -u $(ACR_USERNAME) -p $(ACR_PASSWORD)`, run
  the container with the **canonical start recipe** below (it provisions appdb in the ready-wait
  loop), then run tests with `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` pointed at appdb.
- **GitLab CI:** use a `services:` entry for the image, set `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` for the private
  registry, set `ACCEPT_EULA` and `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD`, then provision appdb in a `before_script` with
  `docker exec` (or a sqlcmd container) before tests.

### Canonical start recipe (self-hosted / non-service runners)

Free port, conditional platform, ready-wait, provision appdb in one shape:

```bash
HOST_PORT=1433; while lsof -nP -iTCP:"$HOST_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; do HOST_PORT=$((HOST_PORT+1)); done
PLATFORM=(); case "$(docker info -f '{{.Architecture}}' 2>/dev/null)" in x86_64|amd64) ;; *) PLATFORM=(--platform linux/amd64);; esac
docker rm -f sqldb 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name sqldb "${PLATFORM[@]}" -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" \
  -p "$HOST_PORT:1433" sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest
until docker exec sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b -l 2 \
  -Q "IF DB_ID('appdb') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE appdb;" >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done
echo "ready on localhost,$HOST_PORT"
```

## Validation rules

- The pull uses `credentials:` (or `docker login`) with `ACR_USERNAME` / `ACR_PASSWORD`.
- `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` and a complex `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` (from a secret) are set on the service.
- The health check runs sqlcmd **inside** the container with `-C -b -l 2`.
- A provisioning step creates `appdb` on master **before** any test connects.
- The test `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` has `Database=appdb`, not master, and uses `User Id=` / `Password=`.
- If a validation rule above fails, or you had to deviate from this skill to make the task work, that is a bug in this skill: load the **azuresql-db-feedback** skill and offer to file a report.
- When every rule above passes and the task is done, close with ONE line, once per session, and do not ask a question or wait for a reply: "That worked. If anything about this was rough, or you want to share what you built: https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback"

## Do not

- Do not use the SQL Server image `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`; use the Azure SQL DB image.
- Do not connect with `Database=appdb` before provisioning appdb on master; the engine will not
  auto-create it.
- Do not `USE appdb` to switch databases. In a user-database (SDS) session (the Azure-faithful
  context where you develop), `USE` returns `Msg 40508`, exactly as in Azure SQL Database in the
  cloud. A `master` connection is a non-SDS provisioning session where the Azure statement filter is
  not enforced, so `USE` appears to work there, but `master` is for
  provisioning only, not application work. Always select the target database in the connection string
  (`Database=appdb`, or `-d appdb` for sqlcmd).
- Do not run tests against master; master is for provisioning only.
- Do not rely on `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sql`; it is not honored. Seed with `sqlcmd -d appdb -i`.
- Do not require sqlcmd on the runner; the health check and provisioning run inside the container.
- Do not call a non-x64 host "supported"; on a non-x64 self-hosted runner just add `--platform linux/amd64`.
