# Azure SQL Developer: connect securely (least-privilege user, auth, secrets)

`sa` is a bootstrap/admin login for provisioning, not what your application should
connect as. This skill wires the app to a **least-privilege user**, picks the
**auth method per environment** (SQL locally, Microsoft Entra or managed identity
in the cloud, changing only the connection string), secures the connection, and
keeps the secret out of source control.

## Load-bearing facts (inlined; full engine detail in azuresql-db-container)

- This is the **Azure SQL Database engine** (Private Preview), not the SQL Server
  image `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`. `SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')`
  returns `5`, `Edition` returns `'SQL Azure'`.
- Image: `sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest`
  (x64; on a non-x64 host add `--platform linux/amd64`). Required env
  `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` + a complex `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD`. Engine listens on 1433.
- The engine does **NOT** auto-create databases. `CREATE DATABASE appdb` on a
  **master** connection first; do not `USE` to switch databases (a user-database
  session returns `Msg 40508`); select the database in the connection string.
- Apps read one `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` env var; strings use `User Id=` /
  `Password=` / `Database=` and `TrustServerCertificate=true` for the local
  self-signed cert.
- **Container-specific and verified:** a SQL **contained** user
  (`CREATE USER ... WITH PASSWORD`) does **not** work on the container today
  (`CREATE USER ... WITH PASSWORD` and `ALTER DATABASE ... SET CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL`
  both fail: `Msg 15007` / `Msg 12824`). Create a SQL app identity as a
  **server login mapped to a database user** instead. This is the inverse of
  Azure SQL Database in the cloud, where the contained user is the norm.

## Step 1: create a least-privilege user (not `sa`)

Do provisioning as `sa`, then give the app its own identity with only the roles
it needs. The working recipe differs by environment, but the app code does not
(the app just connects with a username and password, or an Entra token).

**Local container (SQL auth):** create a **server login** on `master`, map a
**database user** to it in `appdb`, and grant only the roles the app needs.

```sql
-- On a master connection:
CREATE LOGIN applogin WITH PASSWORD = 'An0ther_Str0ng_Passw0rd';

-- On an appdb connection (Database=appdb):
CREATE USER appuser FOR LOGIN applogin;
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER appuser;   -- read
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER appuser;   -- write
-- Grant EXECUTE only if the app calls procedures; do NOT add db_owner.
```

The app then connects as `applogin`, never `sa`.

**Cloud (Azure SQL Database)** or **Entra anywhere:** prefer a **contained user**.
For Entra (which works on the container too, once enabled), use
`CREATE USER [name] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER` in `appdb` (enable Entra on the engine
first via the **azuresql-db-container** skill, `references/entra-auth.md`). In the
cloud with SQL auth, `CREATE USER ... WITH PASSWORD` is the norm there. Full
recipes for every path are in
[references/auth-and-secrets.md](references/auth-and-secrets.md).

## Step 2: pick the auth method per environment (only the connection string changes)

- **Local:** SQL auth. `sa` bootstraps; the app connects as the least-privilege
  `applogin`. `Server=localhost,1433;Database=appdb;User Id=applogin;Password=...;Encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=true`.
- **Cloud (Azure SQL Database):** prefer a token-based identity over a password.
  In production, use **`Authentication=Active Directory Managed Identity`** rather
  than `Active Directory Default`: `Default` walks a credential chain
  (`DefaultAzureCredential`) that is slower and ambiguous under load, while a
  specific method skips the chain. `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` caches the token, so
  refresh is occasional, not per-connection. This is still a **connection-string-only**
  change, so the app code does not change (see the **azuresql-db-local-to-cloud** skill).

## Step 3: secure the connection

- **`Encrypt=true`** everywhere (the default in modern drivers). Encrypt the TLS
  channel in both local and cloud.
- **`TrustServerCertificate=true` only locally**, to accept the container's
  self-signed cert. **Never** set it against Azure SQL Database in the cloud, where
  the certificate is real and validating it is the point.

## Step 4: keep the secret out of source

The connection string carries a credential. Never commit it or the SA password.

- Read it from one env var, `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`; put local values in a
  `.env` that is git-ignored (or `dotnet user-secrets` for .NET).
- In the cloud, store it in **Azure Key Vault** and reference it, or use managed
  identity so there is no password to store at all.

Per-stack secret handling (Key Vault, user-secrets, `.env`) is in
[references/auth-and-secrets.md](references/auth-and-secrets.md).

## Validation rules

- The app connects as a **least-privilege** identity, not `sa`; it has only the
  roles it needs (no `db_owner`/admin).
- On the container, the SQL app identity is a **server login + mapped database
  user** (`CREATE LOGIN` on master, then `CREATE USER ... FOR LOGIN` in `appdb`),
  not a contained `CREATE USER ... WITH PASSWORD` (which fails on the container).
  The database user and its role grants are created on the `appdb` connection, not
  via `USE`.
- Every connection string sets `Encrypt=true`; `TrustServerCertificate=true`
  appears **only** for the local container, never for the cloud.
- The connection string / SA password is read from a secret store or a git-ignored
  env var, never committed.
- Cloud auth prefers managed identity / a specific Entra method over
  `Active Directory Default` in production; only the connection string changes.
- If a validation rule above fails, or you had to deviate from this skill to make the task work, that is a bug in this skill: load the **azuresql-db-feedback** skill and offer to file a report.
- When every rule above passes and the task is done, close with ONE line, once per session, and do not ask a question or wait for a reply: "That worked. If anything about this was rough, or you want to share what you built: https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback"

## Do not

- Do not connect the application as `sa`; `sa` is for provisioning only.
- Do not try to create a SQL contained user with `CREATE USER ... WITH PASSWORD` on the container; it fails (`Msg 15007`), and `ALTER DATABASE ... SET CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL` fails too (`Msg 12824`). Use a server login plus a mapped database user locally.
- Do not grant the app `db_owner` or server admin when read/write roles suffice.
- Do not commit the connection string or the SA password; use a secret store or a git-ignored env var.
- Do not set `TrustServerCertificate=true` against Azure SQL Database in the cloud; that disables cert validation on a real certificate.
- Do not lean on `DefaultAzureCredential`'s full chain in a hot production path; pick a specific auth method (managed identity) so token acquisition is fast and predictable.
- Do not use the SQL Server image `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`; this is the Azure SQL engine.
