# Azure SQL Developer: capabilities, limits, and why

Use this skill to answer "can I / why can't I / is X supported / what's different
from the cloud" questions accurately, instead of guessing from general SQL Server
or Azure SQL Database knowledge. A base model does not know this preview product's
specifics, and the honest answers are often nuanced.

## The mental model: engine vs. managed service vs. SQL Server

The container is the **Azure SQL Database engine, running locally**. It is not the
managed cloud service, and it is not the SQL Server. Sort almost any
"is X supported" question into one of four buckets and the answer follows:

1. **Engine features -> present.** T-SQL dialect, system views, `VECTOR` type and
   `VECTOR_DISTANCE`, Always Encrypted (basic).
   `SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns `5`, `Edition` is `'SQL Azure'`.
2. **Managed-service features -> NOT present.** Automated backups, point-in-time
   restore, geo-replication, elastic pools, hyperscale, serverless auto-pause,
   per-database DTU/vCore caps, audit-to-cloud, and Azure portal / CLI / ARM
   management. These wrap the engine in the cloud; the container is only the engine.
3. **SQL Server-only features -> intentionally absent** (they are not in Azure
   SQL Database either): SQL Agent jobs, FILESTREAM / FileTable, full cross-instance
   Service Broker, linked servers, cross-server distributed transactions, Windows
   Authentication / NTLM.
4. **In-progress in this preview -> works with a caveat:** `CREATE VECTOR INDEX`
   DDL, the VS Code MSSQL extension UI and SSMS, and full PaaS restriction
   enforcement are still being completed.

## Most-asked questions (quick answers)

- **"Can I run this container in Azure / in production?"** No. It is your local inner loop (development, testing, CI, demos), not a production database. For production, deploy the same code to Azure SQL Database in the Microsoft Azure cloud (the outer loop), usually by changing only the connection string. You do not run this container in Azure.
- **"Can I take a backup?"** No: `BACKUP DATABASE` and `RESTORE DATABASE` return **Msg 40510 ("not supported in this version")** on the container, in every session. Azure SQL Database in the cloud likewise does not support them, because backups there are managed by the platform (not run with the `BACKUP` statement). For local data persistence, use a Docker named volume (`-v sqldb-data:/var/opt/mssql`); for managed backups, point-in-time restore, or geo-replication, use Azure SQL Database in the cloud.
- **"Why does `USE otherdb` fail with Msg 40508?"** Because a connection to a user database is an Azure-faithful session that enforces the same restriction as Azure SQL Database in the cloud. Select the database in the connection string (`Database=appdb`), do not switch with `USE`. (`USE` "works" only on a `master` connection, which is a provisioning session.)
- **"Why does connecting fail until I create the database?"** The engine does **not** auto-create databases on connect. Provision once on a `master` connection (`CREATE DATABASE appdb`), then connect with `Database=appdb`.
- **"Is a non-x64 host supported? / Is there an ARM64 build?"** The image is x64 only; there is no native ARM64 build. On an ARM64 host it runs under emulation: add `--platform linux/amd64` (Docker) or `platform: linux/amd64` (compose). Say "runs under emulation", never "ARM64 is supported", and do not promise a native build or a date. If the user wants one, point them at https://aka.ms/azuresql-developer-feature-request.
- **"Why can't I `CREATE VECTOR INDEX`?"** That DDL is still in development. The `VECTOR` type and `VECTOR_DISTANCE` work today; use a full-scan top-k query for now (fine for prototype-sized corpora).
- **"Is Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication supported?"** Yes. Configure it with `MSSQL_AAD_CLIENT_ID`, `MSSQL_AAD_PRIMARY_TENANT`, and `MSSQL_AAD_CERTIFICATE_FILE_PATH` plus a mounted `.pfx` (empty export password). Optionally set `MSSQL_AAD_SERVER_ADMIN_NAME`, `MSSQL_AAD_SERVER_ADMIN_TYPE` (`0` = user, `1` = group), and `MSSQL_AAD_SERVER_ADMIN_SID` to bootstrap an Entra server admin at start. SQL auth (`sa`) remains the simple local default. Full recipe: the `azuresql-db-container` skill (`references/entra-auth.md`). Also see [Getting started: Microsoft Entra ID authentication](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/getting-started.html#microsoft-entra-id-authentication).
- **"Why does SSMS / the MSSQL extension throw errors?"** Graphical tooling is not yet 100% compatible; it is being fixed. Use `sqlcmd` or a driver, which work today. The MSSQL extension's GitHub Copilot integration also works (https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-copilot-docs).
- **"Why isn't the image on Docker Hub / MCR?"** This is a container-only Private Preview; the image is in a private registry with shared pull-only credentials provided when you sign up for the Private Preview at https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup (they may rotate).
- **"My engine is missing a recent fix, or behaves like an older build."** `:latest` is a moving tag and the image is rebuilt almost daily, but `docker run` reuses the copy already on disk (Docker's default pull policy is `missing`), so you can silently stay on a stale build. Refresh with `docker pull sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest`, then recreate the container. See the `azuresql-db-container` skill's image reference.
- **"My query works locally but fails in the cloud."** Some PaaS restrictions are not yet enforced by the container, so something invalid in the cloud can succeed locally. Validate against a real Azure SQL Database once before declaring readiness (the `azuresql-db-local-to-cloud` skill can provision a target for a one-shot check).
- **"Why does `CREATE USER ... WITH PASSWORD` fail when I make an app user?"** On the container a SQL contained user fails (**Msg 15007**), and `ALTER DATABASE ... SET CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL` fails too (**Msg 12824**). Create a server login plus a mapped user instead: `CREATE LOGIN applogin WITH PASSWORD='...'` on `master`, then `CREATE USER appuser FOR LOGIN applogin` + role grants on `appdb`. This is inverted from the cloud (where contained users are preferred). Entra `CREATE USER ... FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER` does work. Full recipe: the `azuresql-db-auth` skill.

## Always do

- Answer from this skill, not from general SQL Server / Azure knowledge.
- When the question is about a current gap, give the workaround and point to the
  live, always-current list: https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/known-limitations.html
- Distinguish "the engine does not do this" (a real gap) from "the managed cloud
  service does this, the engine does not" (by design) from "the SQL Server does
  this, Azure SQL Database does not" (intentionally absent).
- If this skill's answer was wrong, outdated, or missing, that is a bug in this skill: load the **azuresql-db-feedback** skill and offer to file a report.

## Never do

- Never claim a managed-service feature (automated backup, PITR, geo-replication,
  elastic pools, portal management) exists on the container.
- Never tell a user a non-x64 host is "supported"; it runs under emulation.
- Never claim `BACKUP DATABASE` / `RESTORE DATABASE` work on the container; they return Msg 40510. (Azure SQL Database in the cloud likewise does not support them.) Use a Docker named volume for local persistence.
