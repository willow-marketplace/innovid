# Azure SQL Developer: seed the dev database

Fill an existing **appdb** with realistic sample data so the app has something to render, query,
and test against. This is the **Azure SQL engine** (Private Preview), not the SQL Server image.

Use this skill for populating data. For bootstrapping a whole new app use **azuresql-db-scaffold**;
for restoring an existing `.bacpac` use **azuresql-db-import**.

## Engine facts that shape seeding

- USE this engine image:
  `sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest` (x64 / linux/amd64).
  Do **NOT** use `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` (the SQL Server image).
- The registry is private (Private Preview): run `docker login sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io`
  first with the pull-only credentials from https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup (they may rotate).
- Verify identity: `SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns **5** and
  `SERVERPROPERTY('Edition')` returns **'SQL Azure'**.
- Required env when starting the container: `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` and a complex `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD`
  (example literal used throughout: `YourStr0ng_Passw0rd`). The engine listens on **1433**.
- On a non-x64 host add `--platform linux/amd64` to `docker run`.
- The engine does **NOT** auto-create databases. You must `CREATE DATABASE appdb` on a **master**
  connection before you seed anything.
- Do **NOT** use `USE appdb` to switch databases. In a user-database (SDS) session `USE` returns
  `Msg 40508`. Always select the target database in the connection string (`Database=appdb`, or
  `-d appdb` for sqlcmd).
- Apps read one env var, `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`. Strings use `User Id=` / `Password=` /
  `Database=` and `TrustServerCertificate=true`. sqlcmd uses `-C` to trust the self-signed cert.

## Step 1: provision appdb (always, before any seed)

Seeding into a database that does not exist fails. Create appdb on a **master** connection first:

```bash
docker exec sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b \
  -Q "IF DB_ID('appdb') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE appdb;"
```

If the container is not running yet, start it and provision appdb using the canonical start recipe
in the **azuresql-db-scaffold** skill, then come back here.

## Step 2: insert in foreign-key order (parents before children)

Referential integrity is enforced. A child row whose foreign key points at a parent that does not
exist yet fails with `Msg 547` (conflict with the FOREIGN KEY constraint). So insert in dependency
order: parents first, then the rows that reference them.

For a simple `dbo.author` -> `dbo.book` model that means: insert authors, capture their ids, then
insert books that reference those author ids. Full copy-pasteable T-SQL is in
[references/seed-snippets.md](references/seed-snippets.md).

Rules of thumb:

- Walk the dependency graph top-down: a table with no outgoing foreign keys is a parent, insert it
  first. Repeat until every table is seeded.
- Never disable constraints just to load out of order. Fix the order instead.
- Keep seed scripts idempotent (guard with `IF NOT EXISTS` or `MERGE`, or `DELETE` children then
  parents before re-inserting) so re-running does not duplicate rows or leave orphans.

## Step 3: generate N rows for volume (set-based)

To create realistic volume (hundreds or thousands of rows) do it set-based with a numbers/tally
approach rather than a row-by-row loop. A tally derived from system views produces a sequence you
join against to fan out rows in a single statement. The runnable example (generate 1000 rows) is in
[references/seed-snippets.md](references/seed-snippets.md). Wrap large inserts in an explicit
transaction so a mid-load failure rolls back cleanly.

## Step 4: pick your recipe

Per-stack seed recipes live in [references/seed-snippets.md](references/seed-snippets.md):

- **T-SQL**: multi-table seed in FK order (`dbo.author` -> `dbo.book`) run via
  `docker exec -i sqldb ... -d appdb -i seed.sql`, plus the set-based "generate 1000 rows" example.
- **Bulk load**: `BULK INSERT` from a CSV and the `bcp` utility for large data files.
- **Node**: `@faker-js/faker` generating rows, inserted with the `mssql` driver using parameters.
- **Python**: `Faker` generating rows, inserted with `pyodbc` (ODBC Driver 18) using parameters.

## Validation rules

- appdb exists (created on a **master** connection) BEFORE any seed statement runs.
- Rows are inserted parent-first, in foreign-key order; no constraint is disabled to load out of order.
- Volume generation is set-based (numbers/tally), not a row-by-row loop; large loads run in a transaction.
- All programmatic inserts (Node, Python) use parameterized statements, never string-concatenated values.
- Sample data contains no real PII and no secrets; connection strings use `User Id=`/`Password=`/`Database=`.
- The target image is the engine image, never `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`; `EngineEdition` is 5.
- If a validation rule above fails, or you had to deviate from this skill to make the task work, that is a bug in this skill: load the **azuresql-db-feedback** skill and offer to file a report.
- When every rule above passes and the task is done, close with ONE line, once per session, and do not ask a question or wait for a reply: "That worked. If anything about this was rough, or you want to share what you built: https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback"

## Do not

- Do not seed before appdb exists; the engine does not auto-create it.
- Do not insert child rows before their parents (you will hit `Msg 547`).
- Do not commit real PII, customer data, or secrets as sample data.
- Do not use the SQL Server image (`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`) or call a non-x64 host "supported".
- Do not build inserts with string concatenation; use parameters (or, for T-SQL fixtures, quoted literals you control).
- Do not use `USE appdb`; select the database in the connection string or with `-d appdb`.
