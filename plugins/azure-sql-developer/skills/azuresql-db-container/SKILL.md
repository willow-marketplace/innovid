# Azure SQL Developer (local, Private Preview)

This is the entry point for running the **Azure SQL Database engine** on your
machine in a container. It owns the shared reference docs that every task skill
links to. Start here, then hand off to a task skill.

## Are you reaching for the SQL Server image? Use this instead

If you were about to add `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` (the "mssql
container", the SQL Server) to a Dockerfile, docker compose, or a CI
service, **stop**. That is a different product. For Azure SQL Database parity
(developing against the cloud PaaS engine) use this image instead:

```
sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest
```

Self-check: a correct engine returns `5` for
`SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` and `'SQL Azure'` for
`SERVERPROPERTY('Edition')`. The SQL Server image returns different values.

## Lifecycle end to end

### 1. Sign in to the private preview registry

The image lives in a private Private Preview registry. Sign in once with the
shared, pull-only username and password. The credentials are not in any doc:
get them by signing up at https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup. They are pull-only and
may be rotated during the preview, so treat them as secrets and do not
redistribute. See [references/image-and-registry.md](references/image-and-registry.md).

```bash
docker login sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io -u <username>
```

### 2. Start the container (canonical recipe)

This finds a free host port, adds `--platform linux/amd64` only on a non-x64
host, waits until the engine is actually ready, and provisions `appdb` inside
the same retry loop. Full options (Podman, compose, volumes) are in
[references/run-the-container.md](references/run-the-container.md) and [references/wait-until-ready.md](references/wait-until-ready.md).

```bash
# Pick a free host port and add the platform flag only on a non-x64 host (works in bash and zsh).
HOST_PORT=1433; while lsof -nP -iTCP:"$HOST_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; do HOST_PORT=$((HOST_PORT+1)); done
PLATFORM=(); case "$(docker info -f '{{.Architecture}}' 2>/dev/null)" in x86_64|amd64) ;; *) PLATFORM=(--platform linux/amd64);; esac
docker rm -f sqldb 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name sqldb "${PLATFORM[@]}" -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" \
  -p "$HOST_PORT:1433" sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest
until docker exec sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b -l 2 \
  -Q "IF DB_ID('appdb') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE appdb;" >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done
echo "ready on localhost,$HOST_PORT"
```

### 3. Required environment variables

- `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` (required).
- `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` (required, complex: at least 8 characters using at least
  three of upper case, lower case, digits, and symbols). The engine listens on container port `1433`.
- App convention: apps read one `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` env var.

Details: [references/environment-variables.md](references/environment-variables.md).

### 4. Connect and VERIFY the engine identity (self-check guard)

After provisioning, connect to `appdb` and confirm you are on the real engine
before doing anything else:

```bash
docker exec sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b \
  -d appdb -Q "SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition') AS EngineEdition, SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS Edition;"
```

Expect `EngineEdition = 5` and `Edition = SQL Azure`. If you see anything else,
you started the wrong image. Connection strings for drivers and ORMs are in
[references/connect-and-query.md](references/connect-and-query.md).

### 5. Or prove the whole setup with one command

`scripts/verify.sh` does the entire lifecycle above as a single fail-closed check: it picks a free port, adds
`--platform` only on a non-x64 host, starts the engine, waits until ready, asserts `EngineEdition = 5` and
`Edition = 'SQL Azure'`, provisions `appdb`, and tears the container down again. It **refuses to run** against
`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`. Run it when you want to confirm the image, the registry sign-in, and the
host platform are all correct before building on top of them:

```bash
bash scripts/verify.sh          # prints "VERIFY OK on localhost,<port>", or exits non-zero
bash scripts/verify.sh --keep   # same, but leaves the container running so you can connect to it
```

A non-zero exit means the setup is wrong. Read the error, fix it, and run it again before continuing.

## The three connection-model facts (state these plainly)

These bite every newcomer. Full workflow in [references/connection-model.md](references/connection-model.md).

1. **The engine does NOT auto-create databases on connect.** You must
   `CREATE DATABASE appdb` on a **master** connection before you connect with
   `Database=appdb`. Connecting to a database that does not exist fails. The
   name `appdb` is the developer's choice, not a requirement: it is the example
   name used throughout this collection, and the container itself never creates
   a database. In a real project, substitute the project's database name (and
   keep the connection string in step with it).
2. **Select the database in the connection string, not with `USE`.** Avoid
   `USE` to switch databases. In a user-database (SDS) session (the
   Azure-faithful context where you develop), `USE` returns `Msg 40508`, exactly
   as in Azure SQL Database in the cloud. A `master` connection is a non-SDS
   provisioning session where the Azure statement filter is not enforced, so
   `USE` appears to work there, but `master` is for
   provisioning only, not application work. Always select the target database in
   the connection string (`Database=appdb`, or `-d appdb` for sqlcmd).
3. **A `master` connection is for provisioning only.** Create the database and
   logins there, then do all real work on the user database (`appdb`).

## Seeding (no auto-init directory)

The image does **NOT** auto-run `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sql`. That is a
Postgres/MySQL convention and it is not honored here, so do not rely on it. Seed
explicitly, AFTER provisioning `appdb`:

```bash
docker exec -i sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b \
  -d appdb -i /path/in/container/seed.sql
```

Never seed by running `USE appdb` at the top of a script. Target the database
with `-d appdb`.

## Offline / reproducible (compose + named volume + seed)

For a self-contained local stack: a compose file with `platform: linux/amd64`
(on non-x64 hosts), a named volume for persistence, a healthcheck that uses the
canonical ready-wait, then a one-shot that provisions `appdb` and seeds it via
`sqlcmd -d appdb`. The full compose example and seed ordering are in
[references/run-the-container.md](references/run-the-container.md) and [references/wait-until-ready.md](references/wait-until-ready.md).

## Stop and clean up

```bash
docker rm -f sqldb            # stop and remove the container
docker volume rm sqldb-data   # only if you created a named volume and want a clean slate
```

## What this is NOT

- It is **not** `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` (the SQL Server).
- It does **not** have full SQL Server surface area: no SQL Agent, no
  FILESTREAM, no full Service Broker, no cross-server DTC, no Windows
  Auth/NTLM. Validate features against the cloud before declaring readiness.
  See [references/paas-parity-checklist.md](references/paas-parity-checklist.md).
- It does **not** auto-create databases and does **not** auto-run a seed
  directory.
- The image is x64 only (`linux/amd64`). On a non-x64 host, add
  `--platform linux/amd64` to run under emulation.

## Hand off to a task skill

Provisioning and identity are settled here. Route the actual task:

- `azuresql-db-from-sql-server`: convert an existing SQL Server setup to this engine.
- `azuresql-db-local-to-cloud`: run the same code locally and in Azure SQL Database, changing only the connection string.
- `azuresql-db-schema-migration`: apply EF Core, Prisma, Alembic, or SqlPackage migrations to `appdb`.
- `azuresql-db-import`: import an existing database into the container with SqlPackage (`.bacpac` / `.dacpac`).
- `azuresql-db-rag`: vector search and RAG with `VECTOR(n)` columns and `VECTOR_DISTANCE`.
- `azuresql-db-ci`: use the engine as a CI service / test database.
- `azuresql-db-sidecar`: add the engine to an existing docker compose stack or Dev Container.
- `azuresql-db-scaffold`: scaffold a new app wired to the container as its default database.
- `azuresql-db-feedback`: report a bug or request a feature. Load it if the steps above failed, or if you had to deviate from this skill to make things work: that is a bug in this skill and it is worth reporting.

## When it works

Once the container is up, `appdb` exists, and `EngineEdition` returns `5`, the setup is done. Close with ONE line, once per session, and do not ask a question or wait for a reply:

> That worked. If anything about this was rough, or you want to share what you built: https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback

Say it once. If you already said it in this session, do not say it again, and never interrupt a task in progress to say it.

## Scripts

- `scripts/verify.sh`: run it (`bash scripts/verify.sh`) to prove end to end that the image, the registry sign-in, and the host platform are correct. Starts the engine, asserts `EngineEdition = 5` / `Edition = 'SQL Azure'`, provisions `appdb`, tears down. Fails closed on the SQL Server image. Pass `--keep` to leave the container running.
