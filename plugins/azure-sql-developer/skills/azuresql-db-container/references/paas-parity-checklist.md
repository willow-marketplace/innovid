# PaaS parity checklist

This container is the Azure SQL Database engine (EngineEdition 5), not the SQL
Server SQL Server. Some SQL Server features are intentionally absent because
they are not part of the PaaS surface. Validate features against the cloud
before declaring readiness.

## Not present (vs the SQL Server)

- **SQL Server Agent**: no Agent jobs/schedules. Use an external scheduler.
- **FILESTREAM / FileTable**: not available.
- **Full Service Broker**: not the full SQL Server Service Broker surface; do
  not assume cross-instance broker messaging.
- **Cross-server DTC / distributed transactions**: no cross-server MSDTC.
- **Windows Authentication / NTLM**: not available; use SQL authentication
  (`sa` or a SQL login) with the standardized connection string.
- **Cross-database `USE`**: avoid `USE` to switch databases. In a user-database
  (SDS) session (the Azure-faithful context where you develop), `USE` returns
  `Msg 40508`, exactly as in Azure SQL Database in the cloud. A `master`
  connection is a non-SDS provisioning session where the Azure statement filter
  is not enforced, so `USE` appears to work there, but
  `master` is for provisioning only, not application work. Always select the
  target database in the connection string (`Database=appdb`, or `-d appdb` for
  sqlcmd). See `connection-model.md`.

## Vectors: present, with one caveat

- `VECTOR(n)` column type and `VECTOR_DISTANCE('cosine', a, b)` are available.
- Insert with `CAST(CAST(? AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS VECTOR(n))` where **n is a
  literal dimension, never a bind parameter**. A parameterized dimension fails
  with "Incorrect syntax near '@P3'". The inner `CAST(? AS NVARCHAR(MAX))` keeps
  a real embedding's JSON (which exceeds the driver's 4000-char threshold) from
  being sent as ntext, which the engine rejects (error 529).
- `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` (DiskANN) is still in development. For now, use a
  full-scan top-k query with `VECTOR_DISTANCE` instead of an index.

See the `azuresql-db-vectors` task skill for full patterns.

## Current preview limitations

- **`master` is a non-SDS session**: the Azure SQL statement filter (`USE`,
  `SHUTDOWN`, `RECONFIGURE`) is not enforced there, so `USE` works. (`BACKUP` and
  `RESTORE` are not supported in any session and return `Msg 40510`; Azure SQL
  Database in the cloud likewise does not support them.) Never develop or validate
  against `master`; use it only to
  `CREATE`/`DROP DATABASE`, then connect directly to the user database (SDS),
  which enforces Azure SQL Database semantics.
- **Two-step provisioning flow**: provisioning via `master`, then reconnecting to
  the user database, is a current preview limitation. Public preview will let the
  container set a default startup database (for example `MSSQL_DB=appdb`) so you
  connect straight into an Azure-faithful (SDS) session without going through
  `master`.
- **Container-only preview**: the image is not published to public registries
  (MCR / Docker Hub); the shared registry credentials are pull-only and may be
  rotated.

## How to validate parity

Because this is the same engine family as the cloud, treat the cloud as the
source of truth:

1. Confirm identity locally: `SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns
   `5` and `SERVERPROPERTY('Edition')` returns `'SQL Azure'`.
2. For any feature you depend on (Agent-like scheduling, broker, distributed
   transactions, auth mode), confirm it exists in Azure SQL Database before
   building on it. If it is in the "not present" list above, design around it.
3. For features still in development (vector index DDL), use the documented
   interim approach and re-check before declaring production readiness.

## Do not

- Do not assume SQL Server features (Agent, FILESTREAM, full Service Broker,
  cross-server DTC, Windows Auth) are available.
- Do not declare readiness without validating the feature against Azure SQL
  Database in the cloud.
- Do not pass the `VECTOR` dimension as a bind parameter.
- Do not depend on `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` yet; use full-scan top-k.
