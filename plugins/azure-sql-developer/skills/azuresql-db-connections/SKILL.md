# Azure SQL Developer: reliable connections (pooling + retry)

Make the app's database connections reliable with **connection pooling** and **retry /
transient-fault handling**. This is the **Azure SQL engine** (Private Preview), not the SQL
Server image.

## Why do this locally (local-to-cloud parity)

The local container rarely drops a connection, so it is tempting to skip pooling and retry. Do
not. **Azure SQL Database in the cloud throttles and drops connections** during failovers,
scaling, and load; a client with no retry surfaces those as hard errors. Build pooling and
retry now, against the local container, and the **same code survives in the cloud** with no
rewrite. For the full promote-to-cloud story see the **azuresql-db-local-to-cloud** skill.

Verify identity once running: `SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition')` returns **5** and
`SERVERPROPERTY('Edition')` returns **'SQL Azure'**. For full engine detail see the
**azuresql-db-container** skill.

## The engine and the connection contract

- Image: `sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest` (x64 /
  linux/amd64, Private Preview registry). Sign in first:
  `docker login sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io` with the shared pull-only credentials
  from https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup (they may rotate). On a non-x64 host add
  `--platform linux/amd64` (Docker) or `platform: linux/amd64` (compose).
- Do **NOT** use `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` (the SQL Server image).
- Required env: `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` and a complex `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` (example literal:
  `YourStr0ng_Passw0rd`). The engine listens on 1433.
- The engine does **NOT** auto-create databases. `CREATE DATABASE appdb` on a **master**
  connection first. Do not `USE` to switch databases: a user-database (SDS) session returns
  `Msg 40508`. Select the database in the connection string (`Database=appdb`).
- Apps read **one** env var, `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`. Strings use `User Id=` / `Password=` /
  `Database=` and `TrustServerCertificate=true`. sqlcmd uses `-C`.

## Start the container and provision appdb

```bash
HOST_PORT=1433; while lsof -nP -iTCP:"$HOST_PORT" -sTCP:LISTEN >/dev/null 2>&1; do HOST_PORT=$((HOST_PORT+1)); done
PLATFORM=(); case "$(docker info -f '{{.Architecture}}' 2>/dev/null)" in x86_64|amd64) ;; *) PLATFORM=(--platform linux/amd64);; esac
docker rm -f sqldb 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name sqldb "${PLATFORM[@]}" -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" \
  -p "$HOST_PORT:1433" sqldbpreview-dpgaeqhmgphzd4bk.azurecr.io/azure-sql/db-dev:latest
until docker exec sqldb /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P "YourStr0ng_Passw0rd" -C -b -l 2 \
  -Q "IF DB_ID('appdb') IS NULL CREATE DATABASE appdb;" >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 2; done
echo "ready on localhost,$HOST_PORT"
```

The canonical string the app consumes (replace `1433` with the chosen `HOST_PORT` if 1433 was
occupied):

```
Server=localhost,1433;Database=appdb;User Id=sa;Password=YourStr0ng_Passw0rd;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

## Pooling: reuse connections, do not reopen per query

A connection pool keeps a set of open connections and hands one back on each `Open()`. Opening
a pooled connection is cheap; opening a brand-new physical connection per query is not, and it
exhausts server resources under load.

- Keep pooling **on** (it is on by default in most drivers) and let one pool serve the app.
- Set a **bounded** `Max Pool Size` (default 100 in .NET) so a spike cannot open unlimited
  connections. Size it to real concurrency, not a guess.
- A small `Min Pool Size` keeps a few connections warm and cuts cold-start latency.
- One connection string means one pool. Do not build strings dynamically per request (each
  distinct string is a separate pool) and do not open a fresh, unpooled connection per call.
- Always close/dispose connections (or use `using` / `with` / context managers) so they return
  to the pool instead of leaking.

## Retry: only for transient faults, with backoff

A **transient fault** is a temporary condition (throttling, a brief failover, a dropped idle
connection) that succeeds on a retry. In Azure SQL these arrive as specific error numbers (for
example 40501 throttling, 40613 database unavailable, 49918/49919/49920 busy, 4060, 10928,
10929, 40197, 233, and connection-timeout / broken-pipe socket errors).

- Retry **only** transient errors. Retrying a non-transient error (login failure 18456, syntax
  error, constraint violation, permission denied) just fails slower and hides the real bug.
- Use **exponential backoff** with a cap and a small jitter, and a bounded attempt count (for
  example 5 attempts). Do not hammer a throttled server.
- Be careful with **non-idempotent writes**. A retry can double-apply an `INSERT` if the first
  attempt actually committed before the connection dropped. Make writes idempotent (natural or
  client-generated keys, `MERGE`, or wrap the unit of work in a transaction that a retry can
  safely re-run as a whole). The built-in EF Core execution strategy handles this for you when
  work is wrapped in its `Execute`/transaction API.
- Prefer a framework retry policy over hand-rolled loops where one exists (EF Core
  `EnableRetryOnFailure` for .NET). Hand-roll only for raw drivers.

## Per-stack

Copy-pasteable pooling config and transient-only retry for each stack live in
[references/retry-snippets.md](references/retry-snippets.md):

- **.NET** (`Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`): pooling keywords (`Max Pool Size`, `Min Pool Size`,
  `Pooling=true`) and connection-string retry keywords (`ConnectRetryCount`,
  `ConnectRetryInterval`); plus EF Core `EnableRetryOnFailure` (the SqlServer execution
  strategy).
- **Node** (`mssql` / tedious): pool config (`max` / `min` / `idleTimeoutMillis`) and a
  transient-error retry wrapper.
- **Python** (`pyodbc`): connection reuse and a `tenacity` retry decorator that retries only
  transient ODBC errors.

Keep the single `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` contract: pooling and retry are tuned in code and in
driver-specific keywords, not by inventing new env vars.

## Validation rules

- Retry fires **only** on transient errors; non-transient errors (auth, syntax, constraint)
  surface immediately.
- Retry uses bounded attempts with exponential backoff, and non-idempotent writes are made
  safe to re-run (keys, `MERGE`, or a retriable transaction).
- Pooling is on with a **bounded** `Max Pool Size`; connections are disposed and returned to
  the pool, never opened per query.
- One connection string / one pool; the app still reads a single `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`.
- Runs against the engine image with `EngineEdition` 5; appdb was created on a master
  connection before the app connected.
- If a validation rule above fails, or you had to deviate from this skill to make the task work, that is a bug in this skill: load the **azuresql-db-feedback** skill and offer to file a report.
- When every rule above passes and the task is done, close with ONE line, once per session, and do not ask a question or wait for a reply: "That worked. If anything about this was rough, or you want to share what you built: https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback"

## Do not

- Do not retry non-transient errors (auth, syntax, constraint); they will just fail slower.
- Do not retry non-idempotent writes without idempotency (keys, `MERGE`, or a retriable
  transaction).
- Do not set an unbounded pool; do not open a new connection per query instead of pooling.
- Do not invent extra env vars; keep the single `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING` contract.
- Do not use the `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` SQL Server image, and do not call a non-x64
  host "supported".
