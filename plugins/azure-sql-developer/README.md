Azure SQL Developer is the Azure SQL Database engine, running locally in a container. It runs on any modern container runtime (Docker, Podman, containerd, Rancher Desktop) on macOS, Linux, and Windows, and works with the drivers, ORMs, and editors developers already use. It supports the same AI-native capabilities as Azure SQL Database in the Microsoft Azure cloud: the native vector type, vector search with `VECTOR_DISTANCE`, and in-database embeddings (DiskANN vector indexes are in development).

For the first time, developers can build, test, and ship applications against the Azure SQL Database engine without an Azure subscription and without a shared cloud instance. When you deploy to Azure SQL Database in the Microsoft Azure cloud, it is a connection-string change, not a code change.

> The container image is in a private registry. **[Sign up for the Private Preview](https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup)** to get the registry username and password you need to pull it. Signing up is the only way to get access.

## Agent skills

Point your AI coding agent at Azure SQL Developer and let it start the container, provision the database, scaffold the schema, write the migrations, and build the data layer. The repo ships [16 agent skills](docs/agent-skills.md) that work in **Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and VS Code with GitHub Copilot**:

```bash
npx skills add microsoft/azure-sql-database-container
```

Claude Code and Codex users can also install them as a native plugin (`/plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-sql-database-container`). See the **[Agent skills page](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-sql-database-container/agent-skills.html)** for per-tool install and what each skill does, or [browse the skill source](skills/README.md).

Each skill carries its knowledge in layers (instructions, bundled `references/` with version-pinned config shapes, and an optional live layer via the public [Microsoft Learn MCP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/mcp) for the current docs on demand). The MCP is optional; the skills work without it. See [Knowledge layers](skills/README.md#knowledge-layers) and [Using the Microsoft Learn MCP](skills/README.md#using-the-microsoft-learn-mcp-optional).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first: it covers what we are looking for during the Private Preview, how to build the site locally, and the conventions the agent skills follow (which are easy to break in ways that only show up when an agent silently stops loading a skill).
