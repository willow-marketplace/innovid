# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the Azure SQL Database container. This repository holds the documentation, the ready-made prompts, and the `azuresql-db-*` agent skills for the Private Preview. **The container image itself is not built from this repository**, so code changes here affect the docs, the site, and the skills, not the engine.

## What we are looking for

During the Private Preview, the most valuable contributions are:

- **Bug reports about the container.** Something behaves differently from Azure SQL Database in the cloud, or does not work at all: [file a bug](https://aka.ms/azuresqldb-container-bug).
- **Feedback on the agent skills.** A skill told your agent the wrong thing, or no skill loaded when one should have: [tell us](https://aka.ms/sql-agent-skills-feedback). This is the feedback we are least able to get any other way.
- **Feature requests.** Something missing that would change how you use it: [request it](https://aka.ms/azuresqldb-container-feature-request). Filing one also lets us count how many people need the same thing, which is a real input to what we prioritize.
- **Documentation fixes.** Typos, unclear steps, broken commands, missing platform notes. Send a pull request.

## Before you open a pull request

Please **open an issue first** for anything beyond a small documentation fix, so we can agree on the approach before you spend time on it.

If you are changing the agent skills in `skills/`, keep these in mind:

- **Frontmatter is `name` and `description` only.** Anything else is agent-specific and breaks portability across Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex, and Cursor.
- **Descriptions are written in the third person** and name concrete trigger phrases. The description is what the model uses to decide whether to load the skill; it is not documentation for a human.
- **Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines.** Detail belongs in `references/`, which is read only when needed.
- **A skill never references a path outside its own folder.** Skills install independently, so a path into a sibling skill resolves to nothing.
- **Every skill stands alone, even where that means repeating a canonical fact.** A user may install one skill rather than the collection.
- **Do not rename a skill.** The names are published identifiers.

The conventions and the reasoning behind them are in the [skills README](skills/README.md#authoring-standard).

## Not in this repo, on purpose

These were considered and **deliberately left out**. Please do not add them back without opening an issue first; a check in the eval flow fails if they reappear.

- **`.mcp.json.sample`** (a shipped Microsoft Learn MCP config file). Users install the skills into their own project with `npx skills add`; they never clone this repo, so a sample file here is not something they copy. The copy-pasteable snippet lives inline in [Using the Microsoft Learn MCP](skills/README.md#using-the-microsoft-learn-mcp-optional), which is the discoverable, usable form. Keep it there, not as a repo-root file.
- **`docs/llms-full.txt`** (a concatenated dump of every skill + prompt) **and its generator `docs/build-llms-full.sh`**. It duplicates content that is already installed via `npx skills add`, has to be regenerated on every change (a drift risk), and works against the skills' progressive-disclosure design, which loads the one skill an agent needs rather than a ~25k-token blob. The [`docs/llms.txt`](docs/llms.txt) index is the right granularity and stays.

## Building the site locally

The site is Jekyll and is published from `docs/` with GitHub Pages. To preview it:

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4000`.

## Style

- Write for a developer who is new to the product. Explain the why, not just the what.
- Prefer plain language over internal jargon. No severity labels, no codenames.
- The product is the **Azure SQL Database container**, the Azure SQL Database engine shipped as a container for local development. Establish the full name on first mention, then just call it **the container**: keep the technical language technical.
- Commands should be copy-pasteable and correct on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Note when a command differs by container runtime.
