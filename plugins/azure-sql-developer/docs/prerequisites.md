## Private Preview access

The container image is in a private registry, so you must be in the Private Preview to pull it. **[Sign up for the Private Preview](https://aka.ms/sqldbcontainerpreview-signup)** to get the registry username and password (pull-only; may be rotated during the preview). Signing up is the only way to get these credentials, so do this first.

The container is for **local development** (your inner loop). It is not a production database; for production, deploy the same code to Azure SQL Database in the Microsoft Azure cloud (the outer loop).

## Supported host platforms

The image is x64 (`linux/amd64`); on a non-x64 host, add `--platform linux/amd64`.

| Host OS                        | Architecture | Status                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| macOS 14 or later              | x86_64       | Supported (native)                           |
| Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora) | x86_64       | Supported (native)                           |
| Windows 11                     | x86_64       | Supported (WSL2)                             |

## Supported container runtimes

The container is OCI-compliant and runs on any modern runtime. Tested runtimes:

- **Docker** 24 or later
- **Podman** 5.0 or later
- **Rancher Desktop** 1.13 or later
- **containerd** (via `nerdctl` or Kubernetes)
- **[WSL containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers)** (`wslc`, included with WSL on Windows)

Pick the runtime that already works on your machine. The container image and the connection behavior are the same across runtimes.

## System resources

Minimum allocation for the container runtime:

- **CPU:** 2 cores
- **Memory:** 4 GB available to the runtime VM
- **Disk:** 10 GB free for the image and a small database; more for larger datasets

If your container runtime's VM is set lower than this, the container may fail to start or may run with reduced performance.

## Network and connectivity

- **Initial pull:** You need an internet connection the first time you pull the image. After the pull, the container runs fully offline.
- **TDS port:** The container exposes port `1433` by default. Make sure it is not already in use, or remap it in your `docker compose.yml` or run command.
- **No outbound calls.** The container does not call home. It does not require internet connectivity at runtime.

## Tooling

Recommended developer tooling for working with the container:

- **sqlcmd** (the modern Go-based `sqlcmd`) or **mssql-cli** for terminal access. The container also bundles `sqlcmd`, so you can query it with `docker exec` and no host install.
- **A driver or ORM for your stack.** Any driver that talks to Azure SQL Database works with the container without changes: `mssql` (Node.js), `mssql-python`, `pyodbc`, EF Core, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, JDBC.

## Azure account (optional, for local-to-cloud)

The container itself does not require an Azure subscription. The local-to-cloud leg (deploying the same application against Azure SQL Database in production) does require an Azure subscription with permission to create:

- An Azure SQL Database server and database
- A target compute resource for the application: Azure App Service, Azure Container Apps, or Azure Functions, depending on the stack

See the [local-to-cloud skill](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-sql-database-container/tree/main/skills/azuresql-db-local-to-cloud) for the deploy flow. If you do not have an Azure subscription, you can still do all local development and exercise the full inner loop.

## Agent skills (optional, for AI-driven setup)

You do not need these to run the container: the [manual path](getting-started.md#manual-run-it-yourself) is three commands. They matter only if you want an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, or Cursor) or the CLI to do the setup for you. In that case, install the container skills first: they teach your agent the registry sign-in, image name, ports, connection string, and the local-to-cloud handoff, so a single plain-English prompt is enough.

```bash
npx skills add microsoft/azure-sql-database-container
```

> **Check that the skills loaded.** Run `ls .claude/skills/` (Claude Code) and confirm you see the `azuresql-db-*` directories. If that folder is empty while `.agents/skills/` is populated, the installer did not target your agent, and it can report success when this happens. Re-run it naming your agent explicitly, for example `npx skills add microsoft/azure-sql-database-container -a claude-code`. Other agents read from different folders; see the [install matrix](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-sql-database-container/tree/main/skills#install-matrix).

Even with the skills installed, sign in to the registry yourself first with `docker login` (see [Private Preview access](#private-preview-access)). The agent cannot do it: the password is a secret it does not have, and the login is interactive. The skills know the sign-in *step*, the image name, and how to connect, but you supply the credentials. See [Agent skills](agent-skills.md) for per-tool install and ready-made prompts.
