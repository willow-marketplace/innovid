# Spotify Ads API v3 Reference

## Overview

The Spotify Ads API v3 enables programmatic management of advertising campaigns on Spotify. It follows a strict resource hierarchy and uses OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication.

## Base URL

`https://api-partner.spotify.com/ads/v3`

## Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token and tracking headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
X-Spotify-Ads-Sdk: <sdk-product>/<version>
X-Spotify-Ads-Skill: <skill-name>
```

The request wrapper script (`scripts/api-request.sh`) injects these headers automatically. Skills define a local `api()` function that delegates to the wrapper:

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}}"
api() { "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/api-request.sh" <skill-name> "$@"; }
```

To set up authentication, run the configure skill (`/spotify-ads-api:configure` on Claude/Codex, `/configure` on Antigravity), which supports OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh, manual OAuth, or direct token input.

## Resource Hierarchy

```
Business
  └── Ad Account
        ├── Campaign
        │     └── Ad Set
        │           └── Ad (references Assets)
        ├── Draft Campaign (staging — not live until published)
        │     └── Draft Ad Set
        │           └── Draft Ad
        ├── Audience
        ├── Asset
        └── Reports
```

Every CRUD operation on campaigns, ad sets, ads, assets, and audiences is scoped under an **ad account ID**.

**Draft workflow (default for campaign hierarchy writes):** Create drafts for new entities or from published entities → edit → validate → publish only after explicit confirmation. Use this flow for campaign, ad set, and ad creation or modification unless the user explicitly requests a direct live write.

For draft `VALIDATE` and `PUBLISH`, always fetch the draft campaign immediately before the action and use its current `draft_hierarchy_version`. `PUBLISH` creates live entities and always requires explicit user confirmation, even when automatic execution is enabled.

## Key Conventions

- **Budgets use micro-amounts**: Multiply values by 1,000,000 (amounts are in the ad account's billing currency). A $50 budget = `50000000` micro-amount.
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 in UTC (e.g., `2025-09-23T04:56:07Z`).
- **IDs**: UUID format (e.g., `ce4ff15e-f04d-48b9-9ddf-fb3c85fbd57a`).
- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support `limit` (1-50, default 50) and `offset` (default 0).
- **Sorting**: Most list endpoints support `sort_direction` (ASC/DESC) and entity-specific sort fields.
- **Updates use PATCH**: Partial updates with minimum 1 property required. For campaign, ad set, and ad changes, PATCH the draft endpoint by default.
- **No DELETE on live campaigns/ad sets/ads**: Use status changes (ARCHIVED, PAUSED) instead. Draft entities _can_ be deleted.

### Drafts (Default for Campaign Hierarchy Writes)

Draft entities are staging versions that are not live until explicitly published. The full lifecycle:
create drafts → edit → validate → publish.

For changes to published campaigns, ad sets, or ads, first check whether a same-ID draft already exists. Reuse and disclose an existing draft rather than recreating or overwriting pending work. If none exists, use the create-from-published endpoint, PATCH the draft endpoint, and validate the parent draft campaign. A denied direct write does not by itself mean the credentials are read-only; draft staging may still be available.

**Campaign drafts:**
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/campaigns` — Create draft campaign
- `GET /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/campaigns` — List draft campaigns
- `GET /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/campaigns/{draft_id}` — Get draft campaign
- `PATCH /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/campaigns/{draft_id}` — Update draft campaign
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/campaigns/{draft_id}` — Publish or validate (body: `{"action": "PUBLISH"|"VALIDATE", "draft_hierarchy_version": N}`)
- `DELETE /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/campaigns/{draft_id}` — Delete draft campaign

**Ad set drafts:**
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ad_sets` — Create draft ad set (requires `campaign_id` referencing a draft campaign)
- `GET /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ad_sets` — List draft ad sets
- `GET /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ad_sets/{draft_id}` — Get draft ad set
- `PATCH /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ad_sets/{draft_id}` — Update draft ad set
- `DELETE /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ad_sets/{draft_id}` — Delete draft ad set

**Ad drafts:**
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ads` — Create draft ad (requires `ad_set_id` referencing a draft ad set)
- `GET /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ads` — List draft ads
- `GET /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ads/{draft_id}` — Get draft ad
- `PATCH /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ads/{draft_id}` — Update draft ad
- `DELETE /ad_accounts/{id}/drafts/ads/{draft_id}` — Delete draft ad

**Create draft from published entity:**
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/campaigns/{campaign_id}/drafts` — Draft from live campaign
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/ad_sets/{ad_set_id}/drafts` — Draft from live ad set
- `POST /ad_accounts/{id}/ads/{ad_id}/drafts` — Draft from live ad

## Making API Calls

All skills use the request wrapper script (`scripts/api-request.sh`) which handles settings discovery, authentication, and tracking headers automatically:

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT:-${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}}"
api() { "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/api-request.sh" <skill-name> "$@"; }

# GET
api GET "ad_accounts/{ad_account_id}/campaigns?limit=50"

# Draft-first POST with JSON body
api POST "ad_accounts/{ad_account_id}/drafts/campaigns" '{"name":"...","delivery_goal_group":"AWARENESS"}'

# Retrieve settings values for use outside API calls
eval $(api --env)
```

The wrapper reads the user's plugin settings from the active platform settings file (with platform-ordered fallback), reads the plugin version from the platform manifest, and injects `Authorization`, `X-Spotify-Ads-Sdk`, and `X-Spotify-Ads-Skill` headers. It appends `\nHTTP_STATUS:<code>` to every response. Paths use `{ad_account_id}` as a placeholder (auto-substituted from settings).

If the settings file does not exist, the wrapper exits with an error. Instruct the user to run the configure skill first (`/spotify-ads-api:configure` on Claude/Codex, `/configure` on Gemini).
