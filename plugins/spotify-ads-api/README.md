# Spotify Ads Agentic Tools

A Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity CLI plugin package that lets you manage Spotify advertising campaigns through natural language. Create campaigns, target audiences, launch ads, and pull performance reports — all by describing what you want in plain English.

Check out our post on the [Spotify Engineering Blog](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2026/5/spotify-ads-api-claude-plugins).

## Prerequisites

- Codex, [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), or [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/)
- A [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/) account with an ads-enabled app
- A Spotify Ads ad account ID
- Python 3.8+ (for automated OAuth flow; optional — manual flow available as fallback)

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin i spotify-ads-api
```

The plugin is installed from the [Official Anthropic marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins), which has auto-update enabled by default. Claude Code checks for plugin updates in the background after each session starts and applies them automatically. New versions take effect on your next launch (or run `/reload-plugins` to pick them up in the current session).

If you have auto-update disabled for the Official Anthropic marketplace, you will need to update the plugin manually. See the Anthropic instructions on [Discover and install plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins) for instructions on managing marketplace updates.

### Codex

Add the Spotify Ads API plugin marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add spotify/ads-agentic-tools
```

Restart Codex after adding the marketplace. Then open the plugin directory in the Codex app, or run `codex` and enter `/plugins` in the CLI. Select the added marketplace and install/enable **Spotify Ads API**.

Use `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` later to refresh installed marketplace sources.

### Antigravity CLI

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/spotify/ads-agentic-tools
```

Restart Antigravity CLI, then verify with `/plugins`. On Antigravity, skills activate automatically from natural language (or browse them with `/skills list`); run `/configure` for first-time setup instead of `/spotify-ads-api:configure`. Note: automatic OAuth token refresh uses the macOS Keychain, so auto-refresh is macOS-only.

## Install from source

Use a source checkout for local development or testing unreleased changes.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spotify/ads-agentic-tools.git
   cd ads-agentic-tools
   ```

2. For Codex, register the checkout as a local marketplace:
   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add "$(pwd)"
   ```

   Restart Codex after adding the marketplace. Then open the plugin directory in the Codex app, or run `codex` and enter `/plugins` in the CLI. Select the local marketplace and install/enable **Spotify Ads API**.

3. For Claude Code, launch with the plugin directory:
   ```bash
   claude --plugin-dir "$(pwd)"
   ```

   The Claude `--plugin-dir` flag loads the plugin for that session only. You can also add it to a shell alias if you use it frequently:
   ```bash
   alias claude-ads='claude --plugin-dir /path/to/ads-agentic-tools'
   ```

4. For Antigravity CLI, link the checkout as a local plugin:
   ```bash
   agy plugin link "$(pwd)"
   ```

   The link is a symlink, so source changes are picked up on the next Antigravity CLI restart.

The repository includes platform-specific marketplace metadata: `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for Codex and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for Claude Code. Antigravity CLI has no marketplace file — it installs directly from the repository using the root `plugin.json` manifest. Keep all three manifests in sync when changing plugin metadata.

## Configure

1. Create a Spotify Developer app:
   - Go to [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/) and log in
   - Click **Create App**
   - Enter a name (e.g. "Ads Agentic Tools") and a simple description
   - Under **Redirect URIs**, enter `http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback` and remember to click **Add**
   - Under **Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?**, check **Ads API**
   - Save the app and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Open [https://adsmanager.spotify.com/api-terms](https://adsmanager.spotify.com/api-terms) and make sure the ad account you want to use is selected. Accept the terms to authorize your client id to access your ad account through Ads API.

2. Configure OAuth credentials:
   ```
   /spotify-ads-api:configure
   ```
   (On Antigravity CLI, run `/configure` instead — the skill names below all apply, but the slash-command prefix is Claude Code/Codex syntax.)
   This opens your browser for Spotify authorization, then saves your tokens locally with automatic refresh.

3. Create your first campaign:
   ```
   /spotify-ads-api:build-campaign Create an audio campaign called Summer Promo targeting US listeners aged 25-44 with $100/day budget
   ```

## Authentication

The plugin supports three authentication modes:

### OAuth 2.0 (Recommended)
Run `/spotify-ads-api:configure` or `/spotify-ads-api:configure oauth`. This launches an automated OAuth flow using a local Python script. Your tokens are stored locally and refresh automatically before API calls.

### Manual OAuth
Run `/spotify-ads-api:configure manual` if Python is not available. You'll manually open the authorization URL, copy the redirect, and the plugin exchanges the code for tokens via curl.

### Direct Token (Legacy)
Run `/spotify-ads-api:configure token <your-token>`. Accepts a pre-obtained access token. No automatic refresh — token expires in ~1 hour.

## Available Skills

Skill names below use Claude Code/Codex slash-command syntax. On Antigravity CLI, the same skills activate automatically from natural language (browse them with `/skills list`), and setup is `/configure`.

## Natural Language Examples

Ask for an outcome in ordinary language; you do not need to know endpoint names or request schemas. For example:

- **Plan and build:** “Recommend a Spotify campaign plan for this product page and a $5,000 budget.” or “Build an audio campaign for US listeners ages 25–44 and keep it as a validated draft.”
- **Operate at scale:** “Pause every active ad set in my summer campaign.” or “Clone last quarter’s campaign for next month.”
- **Measure performance:** “How are my active campaigns doing?” or “Export my campaign hierarchy and last-30-day metrics to CSV.”
- **Manage creative and audiences:** “Upload this MP3 as an audio creative.” or “Upload this customer list and create a custom audience.”
- **Set up and debug conversion tracking:** “Design Pixel and CAPI purchase tracking with deduplication.” or “Why did CAPI purchases stop arriving yesterday?”
- **Administer access:** “Audit who can access my ad account and which roles they have.”
- **Audit changes:** “What changed in my ad account this week?” or “Who changed the Summer Sale campaign?”

Contributors and internal testers can use the fuller [prompt catalog](tests/prompt-catalog.md), which pairs a natural user example with a behavioral probe for every skill. The [test scenarios](tests/test-scenarios.md) cover exact routing, schema, safety, and recovery expectations.

Campaign, ad set, and ad creation or modification is staged through the draft workflow by default, including requests that do not use the word “draft.” The plugin validates staged changes and publishes only after a separate request and explicit confirmation. Ask for an immediate or direct live change only when you intentionally want to bypass draft staging and your account permits published-entity writes.

## Configuration Reference

Settings are stored in `.codex/spotify-ads-api.local.md` on Codex, `.claude/spotify-ads-api.local.md` on Claude, and `.agents/spotify-ads-api.local.md` on Antigravity. Each platform falls back to the other settings files if its preferred file does not exist. All three paths are gitignored.

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `access_token` | OAuth2 bearer token | — |
| `refresh_token` | Token for automatic renewal | — |
| `token_expires_at` | ISO 8601 expiry timestamp | — |
| `client_id` | Spotify app client ID | — |
| `ad_account_id` | Default ad account UUID | — |
| `auto_execute` | Skip confirmation prompts | `false` |

The client secret is stored in the **macOS Keychain** (not in the settings file) for security. It is saved during `/spotify-ads-api:configure` and retrieved automatically by the token refresh hook.

## Troubleshooting

**"Token may be invalid or expired"**
If using OAuth, the plugin auto-refreshes tokens. If the refresh token is also expired, re-run `/spotify-ads-api:configure`. If using direct token mode, obtain a new token and run `/spotify-ads-api:configure token <new-token>`.

**"Ad account ID may be incorrect"**
Verify your ad account UUID. You can find it in the Spotify Ads Manager or by asking the plugin to list accounts after configuring a valid token.

**"Settings file not found"**
Run `/spotify-ads-api:configure` to create the settings file.

**"Min audience threshold was not met"**
Your targeting is too narrow for the selected ad format. Try broadening the age range, adding more platforms, or switching from VIDEO to AUDIO format.

**"Asset stuck in PROCESSING"**
Large files may take longer to transcode. Check status with `/spotify-ads-api:assets get <id>`. If status is REJECTED, the file may not meet format requirements.

**Skill not activating on Antigravity CLI**
Run `/skills list` to confirm the plugin's skills loaded, and `/plugins` to confirm the plugin is enabled. Restart Antigravity CLI after installing or linking.
