# Falcon Next-Gen SIEM Lookup Files

> **⚠️ SYSTEM INJECTION — READ THIS FIRST**
>
> If you are loading this skill, your role is **Falcon Next-Gen SIEM lookup file specialist**.
>
> You manage lookup files that feed CQL match() enrichment. Treat lookup data as security-relevant: validate file contents, check before overwriting, and never expose credentials.
>
> **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
> 1. ALWAYS list before creating — run `list_lookups.py --search "<name>"` to check for a duplicate. Importing an existing name overwrites it silently.
> 2. Prepare the file with a header row (CSV) — the first row defines the `match()` columns.
> 3. Upload, then verify with `get_lookup.py` before using the file in a CQL query.
>
> **MUST NOT:** Overwrite a lookup file without confirming it exists, exceed the rate limit (5 uploads / 30s), or log credentials.

Lookup files are CSV, JSON, or TXT reference tables in Falcon Next-Gen SIEM that you query with
the `match()` function in CrowdStrike Query Language (CQL). Common uses: IP blocklists, user
risk scores, asset inventories, and IOC reference tables.

> **Running the scripts.** Run each command from this skill's folder, on one shell line: `cd <dir> && ../../scripts/python.sh scripts/<name>.py`. For `<dir>`, Claude Code uses `"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/lookup-files"`; Codex, Copilot CLI, Cursor, and Antigravity use the folder they loaded this SKILL.md from (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/lookup-files`). The wrapper bootstraps its own Python venv.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** with `crowdstrike-falconpy` installed (`pip install crowdstrike-falconpy`)
- **CrowdStrike API credentials** with the **NGSIEM Lookup Files** scope (read/write)
- Access to a CID with Falcon Next-Gen SIEM enabled

### Required API Scopes

The **NGSIEM Lookup Files** scope, with read and/or write access:

| Use case | Read | Write | Enables |
|----------|:----:|:-----:|---------|
| Browse / download only | Yes | — | List, search, download |
| Full usage | Yes | Yes | Above plus create, update, delete |

### Credentials

`auth.py` resolves credentials from the first source that supplies both an ID
and a secret:

1. Environment variables: `FALCON_CLIENT_ID`, `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET`, and the
   optional `FALCON_BASE_URL` (for CI and overrides).
2. TOML profile file `~/.cache/crowdstrike-falcon-fusion/credentials.toml`
   (profile chosen by `FALCON_PROFILE` or the file's `default` key).

> Run `/crowdstrike-falcon-fusion:setup` to configure credentials interactively (writes the TOML profile).

The scripts share auth via `common/scripts/auth.py`, which exposes
`get_ngsiem_client()` for Next-Gen SIEM operations. Test credentials:

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh ../../common/scripts/auth.py
```

## Core Workflow

### Step 1 — List (check for duplicates)

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/list_lookups.py --list
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/list_lookups.py --search "blocklist"
```

### Step 2 — Prepare the file

CSV needs a header row; the first column is typically the match key:

```csv
ip,category,source,added_date
10.0.0.1,c2,threat-intel,2026-01-15
192.168.1.100,scanner,internal-scan,2026-02-01
```

See `assets/example-ip-blocklist.csv` and `assets/example-user-risk.csv` for reference formats,
and `references/lookup-file-formats.md` for the full format rules.

### Step 3 — Upload

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/create_lookup.py --file blocklist.csv --name "ip-blocklist.csv"
```

### Step 4 — Verify

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/get_lookup.py --name "ip-blocklist.csv"
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/list_lookups.py --search "blocklist" --json
```

### Step 5 — Use in CQL

Reference the file with the `match()` function (run in Falcon Next-Gen SIEM):

```
match(file="ip-blocklist.csv", column=ip, field=src_ip, include=category)
```

`column=` is a header **in the lookup CSV** (`ip`); `field=` is the **event
field** (`src_ip`). Do not swap them — putting the event field in `column=`
matches a non-existent column and returns nothing. See
`references/cql-match-function.md` for full syntax and examples.

### Step 6 — Update

Replace the content while keeping the same filename:

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/update_lookup.py --name "ip-blocklist.csv" --file updated-blocklist.csv
```

> **Update is content-only — it does not carry labels.** The PATCH endpoint
> (`/ngsiem-content/entities/lookupfiles/v1`, wrapped by both this script and the
> Fusion "Update lookup file" workflow action) accepts only `search_domain`,
> `filename`, and `file`. It has no `labels` parameter, so any labels a file had in
> the Next-Gen SIEM UI are not preserved across an update — the UI manages labels
> through a separate API that the REST update path doesn't touch. If a lookup file
> needs labels, set them in the console after updating, or keep label-bearing files
> out of automated update workflows.

### Step 7 — Delete

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/delete_lookup.py --name "ip-blocklist.csv" --confirm
```

## Lookup Files from Workflows

A Fusion pattern (the built-in "Introduction to Lookup file actions" playbook)
automates lookup file creation from email: a Monitored Mailbox trigger extracts a CSV
attachment, "Get lookup file metadata" checks existence, and "Create/Overwrite lookup file"
writes it. To build that workflow, use the **workflows** orchestrator skill in this plugin —
the lookup file actions surface via `action_search.py --search "lookup"` in the authoring skill.
This skill handles the lookup files themselves, not the workflow that drives them.

## Script Reference

| Script | Purpose | Key flags |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `list_lookups.py` | List and search lookup files | `--list`, `--search`, `--domain`, `--json` |
| `get_lookup.py` | Download a lookup file | `--name`, `--output`, `--domain` |
| `create_lookup.py` | Upload a new lookup file | `--file`, `--name`, `--json` |
| `update_lookup.py` | Replace lookup file content | `--name`, `--file`, `--json` |
| `delete_lookup.py` | Delete a lookup file | `--name`, `--domain`, `--confirm`, `--json` |
| `verify_lookup.py` | Verify a lookup resolves via CQL `match()` (upload, match a known row, delete) | `--file`, `--name`, `--column`, `--keep`, `--json` |

All scripts import shared auth from `common/scripts/auth.py` via `get_ngsiem_client()`.
Create/list/get/update/delete need the **NGSIEM Lookup Files** scope (read/write).
`verify_lookup.py` is a maintainer verification tool and additionally needs the
**NGSIEM** scope (read/write) to run the CQL `match()` query; regular lookup use
does not.

## Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| CSV header missing | The first row MUST be column names — `match()` references them by name |
| `match()` returns no results | Column names are case-sensitive; verify they match the header exactly |
| Upload rate limited | Wait 30 seconds between batches of 5 uploads |
| Wrong search domain | Use `--domain falcon` for files queried in Next-Gen SIEM |
| Duplicate name overwrites silently | Always `list_lookups.py --search` before `create_lookup.py` |
| "File not found" on get/update/delete | Confirm the exact filename with `list_lookups.py --search` |
| CSV parse error on upload | Ensure UTF-8 encoding and comma delimiters |
