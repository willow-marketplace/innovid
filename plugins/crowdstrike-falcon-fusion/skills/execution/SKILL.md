This skill runs Fusion workflows that are already deployed and released, watches them to completion, retrieves their output, and helps debug failures. Writing the YAML happens in the **authoring** skill; importing and releasing happens in the **deployment** skill.

An execution moves through states and ends in a **terminal** state. The terminal states are `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Canceled`, `NonRecoverable`, and `ActionRequired`. (`ActionRequired` is terminal for polling: it waits on human input and will not progress on its own.) Anything else means the execution is still running.

> **Running the scripts.** Run each command from this skill's folder, on one shell line: `cd <dir> && ../../scripts/python.sh scripts/<name>.py` (a sibling skill's script is `../<skill>/scripts/<name>.py`). For `<dir>`, Claude Code uses `"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/execution"`; Codex, Copilot CLI, Cursor, and Antigravity use the folder they loaded this SKILL.md from (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/execution`). The wrapper bootstraps its own Python venv.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+**
- **FalconPy** SDK installed (`pip install crowdstrike-falconpy` — leave unpinned per CrowdStrike guidance)
- API credentials resolved by `common/scripts/auth.py` from environment
  variables (for CI/overrides) or the TOML profile:
  - `FALCON_CLIENT_ID`
  - `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `FALCON_BASE_URL` (optional; defaults to `https://api.crowdstrike.com`)

  Run `/crowdstrike-falcon-fusion:setup` to configure credentials interactively (writes the TOML profile).
- An API client with the **Workflow** API scope
- The **definition ID** of the workflow to run (from the deployment skill's import output, or `query_workflows.py --search`)
- Verify auth before running:
  ```bash
  ../../scripts/python.sh ../../common/scripts/auth.py
  ```

## Core Workflow

### 1. Verify the workflow is deployed and released

A workflow must be enabled before it will execute. Confirm it exists and is enabled:

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh ../deployment/scripts/query_workflows.py --search "my workflow"
```

Look for `Status: enabled` in the output. If it shows `disabled`, release it first with the deployment skill (`release_workflow.py --id <id>`).

### 2. Trigger the workflow with a payload

```bash
# Pass parameters inline as JSON
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/trigger_workflow.py --id <definition_id> --params '{"device_id":"abc123"}'

# Or let the script prompt you interactively from the workflow's parameter schema
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/trigger_workflow.py --id <definition_id>
```

On success the script prints an **execution ID**. Capture it — you need it to monitor and to fetch results.

### 3. Monitor the execution

Poll until the execution reaches a terminal state:

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/monitor_execution.py --execution-id <execution_id>

# Tune the cadence for long-running workflows
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/monitor_execution.py --execution-id <execution_id> --interval 10 --timeout 600
```

Status updates go to stderr; the final result goes to stdout, so you can pipe the result while still watching progress.

> **Shortcut:** `trigger_workflow.py --wait` triggers and polls in one step. Use `monitor_execution.py` directly when you triggered earlier, from the console, or from another tool.

### 4. Get the results

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/get_execution_results.py --execution-id <execution_id>
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/get_execution_results.py --execution-id <execution_id> --json
```

This is a single fetch — use it after `monitor_execution.py` reports a terminal state, or any time you want the current status and output without polling.

### 5. Debug failures

When an execution ends in `Failed` or `NonRecoverable`:

- Pull the full record with `--json` to see the `output` and any error detail:
  ```bash
  ../../scripts/python.sh scripts/get_execution_results.py --execution-id <execution_id> --json
  ```
- Check the inputs you sent. Missing or empty required parameters are the most common cause.
- Re-run with corrected parameters. For workflows that support resume, the Fusion console can resume a failed execution; these scripts trigger fresh executions.
- **Analyzing failures across many executions** (success rates, top failing workflows, error-code breakdowns, find-by-value) is a job for CQL over the `fusion` execution-log repo, not the per-execution scripts. See `references/execution-log-queries.md`.
- **A workflow that looks stuck "in progress"** may be **throttled**, not failed — Fusion paces an action when its execution volume exceeds a limit, queuing and auto-retrying it (up to 6 hours). This is not an error. See `references/throttling.md`.

## Script Reference

All scripts add `common/scripts` to `sys.path` and import from the shared `auth` module. `monitor_execution.py` and `trigger_workflow.py` reuse `fetch_results` and the terminal-status set from `get_execution_results.py`, so they stay in sync on the API response shape.

| Script | Purpose | Key flags |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `trigger_workflow.py` | Execute a workflow with params; optionally wait | `--id DEF_ID` (required), `--params JSON`, `--wait`, `--timeout SECS`, `--json` |
| `monitor_execution.py` | Poll an execution until terminal/timeout | `--execution-id ID` (required), `--interval SECS`, `--timeout SECS`, `--json` |
| `get_execution_results.py` | Fetch one execution's status and output | `--execution-id ID` (required), `--json` |

### trigger_workflow.py

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/trigger_workflow.py --id <def_id> --params '{"k":"v"}'
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/trigger_workflow.py --id <def_id>                 # Interactive prompts
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/trigger_workflow.py --id <def_id> --params '{}' --wait --timeout 120
```

Parameters come from `--params` (a JSON string) or interactive prompts derived from the workflow's parameter schema, with type coercion for integers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The execute endpoint returns the execution ID as a bare string or an object; the script handles both shapes.

### monitor_execution.py

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/monitor_execution.py --execution-id <exec_id>
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/monitor_execution.py --execution-id <exec_id> --interval 10 --timeout 600 --json
```

Defaults: `--interval 5`, `--timeout 300`. Prints status updates to stderr and the final result to stdout. Exits `0` only when the execution `Succeeded`; non-zero on any other terminal state or timeout, so CI can react.

### get_execution_results.py

```bash
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/get_execution_results.py --execution-id <exec_id>
../../scripts/python.sh scripts/get_execution_results.py --execution-id <exec_id> --json
```

Single fetch. Reads `resources[0]` from the API envelope for the execution's `status` and `output`.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Triggering an unreleased workflow.** A disabled definition will not execute. Confirm `Status: enabled` (step 1) before triggering, and release it via the deployment skill if needed.

2. **Missing required parameters.** When triggered via API (not the console UI), parameters are not prompted by the platform. Pass every required field in `--params`. Empty params are the most common failure cause.

3. **Assuming success without checking status.** A returned execution ID means the run started, not that it succeeded. Always confirm the terminal status with `monitor_execution.py` or `get_execution_results.py`.

4. **Too-short timeout.** Long workflows (loops over many devices, paginated API calls) can exceed the 120s/300s defaults. Raise `--timeout` and `--interval` for these — a timeout does not cancel the execution; it just stops polling.

5. **Malformed `--params` JSON.** The value must be valid JSON (double-quoted keys/strings). `{'k':'v'}` is not valid JSON and will raise a parse error before the workflow is triggered.

6. **Treating `ActionRequired` as still-running.** `ActionRequired` is terminal for polling — the workflow is paused for human input and will not advance on its own. Resolve the input request in the Fusion console; it will not clear from these scripts.

## Handoff

- **Came from deployment?** You have a definition ID and a released workflow — start at step 2 (trigger).
- **Execution failed?** If the YAML logic is wrong, return to the **authoring** skill to fix it, then re-import and re-release via **deployment** before triggering again.
