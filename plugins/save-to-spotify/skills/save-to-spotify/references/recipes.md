# Recipes

Ready-to-use content templates for the onboarding flow. Each recipe is fully defaulted — the agent can produce a complete episode without asking the user anything beyond "what would you like to create?"

When the user picks a recipe, **do not ask the input question**. Use the default input instead. The user can always refine after hearing the result. The goal is zero typing to first episode.

Each recipe carries a **default Kokoro voice** in its table below — use it as the first suggestion when the user is on Kokoro (they can still pick another at the voice step). The rows are the single source of truth for which voice fits which recipe.

## Daily briefing

**Description:** Your calendar, tasks, and repo activity as a short morning brief.

**Default input:** Pull from whatever is available — Google Calendar, GitHub, Linear. Auto-detect connected services.
**Input question (only if user asks to customize):** "What accounts or services should I pull from?"

| Default | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Length | ~8 min |
| Segments | 3–4 (schedule, repo, tasks, optional weather) |
| Show name | Daily Briefings |
| Kokoro voice | af_heart |

**Data sources:** Google Calendar API, GitHub notifications/PRs, Linear tasks, optionally weather API.

**Example prompt:**
> Make me a daily briefing from my Google Calendar, GitHub notifications, and Linear tasks.

## Deep dive

**Description:** Turn a topic into a personalized audio explainer.

**Default input:** Cannot be fully defaulted — the topic is the user's intent; a deep dive on a topic they didn't choose is homework, not a gift. Suggest, don't pick.
**Input question:** "What should we dive into?" — present **3 personalized topic suggestions as options** (inferred from the user's repos, role, and recent activity — the same signals you'd have used to pick silently) plus the free-text field for their own topic. One click, no interview.

**One topic per episode.** Multiple sources are fine when they cover the same topic — never mix unrelated topics into one deep dive.

| Default | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Length | ~8 min |
| Segments | 4–6 (intro, background, key points, analysis, takeaways) |
| Show name | Deep Dives |
| Kokoro voice | af_heart |

**Data sources:** Web search, user-provided URLs, PDFs, and documents.

**Example prompt:**
> Deep dive into this article: https://example.com/interesting-post

|---------|-------|
| Length | ~20 min |
| Segments | 6–8 (slow, meandering, low-stakes) |

## Using recipes

Recipes are pick-and-go. The user picks one and the agent starts generating immediately:

1. User picks a recipe (or the agent picks the best fit from their prompt)
2. Agent uses the **default input** — no questions asked
3. Smart defaults apply (language from locale, length from recipe, voice from TTS default)
4. Show auto-created from recipe name
5. Generate, preview, save

Only ask the input question if the recipe cannot be defaulted (travel guide needs a destination, meeting recap needs a transcript) or the user explicitly asks to customize.

After the first episode, users can customize any default through the standard interview flow in SKILL.md.
