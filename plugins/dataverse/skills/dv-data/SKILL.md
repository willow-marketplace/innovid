# Skill: Data — Create, Update, Delete, and Bulk Import

> **This skill uses Python exclusively.** Do not use Node.js, JavaScript, or any other language for Dataverse scripting. If you are about to run `npm install` or write a `.js` file, STOP — you are going off-rails. See the overview skill's Hard Rules.

Use the official Microsoft Power Platform Dataverse Client Python SDK for all data write operations.

**Official SDK:** https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPlatform-DataverseClient-Python
**PyPI package:** `PowerPlatform-Dataverse-Client` (this is the only official one — do not use `dataverse-api` or other unofficial packages)
**Status:** GA (`1.0.0`, Production/Stable)

## Skill boundaries

| Need | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Query or read records | **dv-query** |
| Create tables, columns, relationships, forms, views | **dv-metadata** |
| Export or deploy solutions | **dv-solution** |
| ERP writes | See [`references/erp-writes.md`](references/erp-writes.md) |

## Choosing MCP vs the SDK for writes

**If MCP tools are available** (`create_record`, `update_record`, `delete_record`), they are the quickest path for a **small, interactive** set of writes — they batch up to 25 records per call, no script needed. The SDK is the default when the task needs bulk writes beyond 25 (it holds rows in memory for large batches), data transformation, retry logic, CSV import, or SDK-only operations (upsert — MCP has no upsert tool). Sequential MCP tool calls are not "multi-step logic" — MCP handles those fine. Pick the surface that fits the volume and shape of the work; neither order is mandated.

## When you script a write, use the SDK — not hand-rolled HTTP

The MCP-vs-SDK choice is capability-based (above; and see the overview's **Tool Capabilities** / Hard Rule 2). This section is narrower: **once you've decided to write via a script**, use the SDK for anything in its "supports" list rather than hand-rolled `urllib`/`requests` — the SDK carries the auth, paging, and retry those re-implement. For the rare operation the SDK doesn't cover, use the `dataverse api` escape hatch — not hand-rolled `urllib`.

**Correct import** (always preceded by `sys.path.insert` in a full script — see Setup below):
```
from auth import get_client
```

**WRONG for SDK-supported operations:**
```
from auth import get_token, load_env  # WRONG for SDK-supported ops
import requests                        # WRONG for SDK-supported ops
```

`get_token()` and `requests` exist ONLY for genuine gaps with no managed path (global option sets, unbound actions) — and even then prefer the managed `dataverse api` escape hatch. Forms/views, aggregation, and N:N reads are all covered by the SDK; see **dv-query** and **dv-metadata**.

---

## What This SDK Supports (Data Operations)

- Record writes: create, update, delete
- Record reads within write workflows (e.g., lookup resolution) — for standalone queries see **dv-query**
- Upsert (with alternate key support)
- Bulk operations: `CreateMultiple`, `UpdateMultiple`, `UpsertMultiple`
- File column uploads (chunked for files >128MB)
- Context manager with HTTP connection pooling

## What This SDK Does NOT Support

Forms/views (`systemform`/`savedquery`) **are** ordinary records — create/modify them with `client.records.*` (see **dv-metadata**), and read N:N with `records.list(expand=...)`. For the genuine gaps below, prefer the managed `dataverse api` escape hatch over raw `urllib`:
- Global option sets — see **dv-metadata**
- N:N record association — CLI `dataverse data associate`, or `POST /api/data/v9.2/<entity>(<id>)/<nav-property>/$ref`
- `$apply` aggregation — use `client.query.fetchxml()`; see **dv-query**
- Unbound actions (e.g., `PublishXml`, `InstallSampleData`) — `dataverse api request`/`invoke`
- DeleteMultiple, general OData batching

---

## Setup

```python
import os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "scripts"))
from auth import get_client

# get_client sets a plugin attribution context on the User-Agent header.
# Do not modify the context value — it is a closed schema for server-side
# telemetry (app/skill/agent). Never include secrets or PII.
client = get_client("dv-data")
```

`get_client(skill)` handles auth, environment URL, and plugin attribution (User-Agent tagging). See `scripts/auth.py`.

For scripts that run to completion: wrap in `with DataverseClient(...) as client:` for automatic connection cleanup (recommended). For notebooks and interactive sessions, the explicit client above is simpler.

---

## Field Name Casing Rule

Getting this wrong causes 400 errors.

| Property type | Convention | Example | When used |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Structural** (columns) | LogicalName — always lowercase | `new_name`, `new_priority` | Record payload keys |
| **Navigation** (lookups) | Navigation Property Name — case-sensitive, matches `$metadata` | `new_AccountId` | `@odata.bind` keys |

The SDK lowercases structural keys automatically but preserves `@odata.bind` key casing.

---

## Create a Record

```python
guid = client.records.create("new_ticket", {
    "new_name": "Ticket 001",
    "new_priority": 100000002,          # choice column — integer value, not string
    "new_AccountId@odata.bind": "/accounts(<account-guid>)",
})
print(f"Created: {guid}")
```

**`@odata.bind` notes:**
- Key is the Navigation Property Name: `new_AccountId@odata.bind` (the SDK preserves casing automatically, but matching the schema name is still the correct form)
- Value is `"/<EntitySetName>(<guid>)"` — e.g., `"/accounts(<guid>)"`
- If you just created the lookup column, wait 5–10 seconds before inserting. Metadata propagation delays cause "Invalid property" errors.
- Choice columns use integer values, not strings: `"new_priority": 100000002` (not `"High"`)

### Common `@odata.bind` patterns

| Lookup | Correct key | Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| Custom: `new_AccountId` | `new_AccountId@odata.bind` | ~~`new_accountid@odata.bind`~~ |
| System polymorphic: `customerid` | `customerid_account@odata.bind` | ~~`customerid@odata.bind`~~ |
| System: `parentcustomerid` | `parentcustomerid_account@odata.bind` | ~~`_parentcustomerid_value@odata.bind`~~ |

### Find the Navigation Property Name

After creating a lookup via SDK: `result.lookup_schema_name` is the navigation property name.

For existing system tables, query:
```
GET /api/data/v9.2/EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<entity>')/ManyToOneRelationships
  ?$select=ReferencingEntityNavigationPropertyName,ReferencedEntity
```

---

## Update a Record

```python
client.records.update("new_ticket", "<record-guid>",
    {"new_status": 100000001})
```

---

## Delete a Record

```python
client.records.delete("new_ticket", "<record-guid>")
```

---

## Bulk Create (SDK uses CreateMultiple internally)

```python
records = [{"new_name": f"Ticket {i}", "new_priority": 100000000} for i in range(500)]
guids = client.records.create("new_ticket", records)
print(f"Created {len(guids)} records")
```

Volume guidance: MCP `create_record` batches up to 25 records per call. SDK `CreateMultiple` for larger bulk.

**Important:** The SDK sends all records in a single POST to `CreateMultiple`. It does **not** chunk automatically. Dataverse has no fixed record count limit — the constraints are payload size and request timeout (SDK default: 120s for POST). For larger datasets, you **must** chunk in your script. The `bulk_upsert` and `bulk_create` helpers below use adaptive chunking: start at 1,000, double on success (up to 4,000), halve on payload/timeout failure, and cap at the last successful size. Tables with few columns can handle larger chunks than tables with many columns.

---

## Bulk Update

```python
# Broadcast same change to multiple records
client.records.update("new_ticket",
    [id1, id2, id3],
    {"new_status": 100000001})
```

---

## DataFrame Write-Back

To create or update records from a pandas DataFrame, use the `client.dataframe` namespace (`create`/`update`). This is documented in **dv-query** but is a write operation — include it in your data write workflow:

```python
# Update records — DataFrame must include the primary key column
client.dataframe.update("opportunity", df_updates, id_column="opportunityid")

# Create records — returns a Series of new GUIDs
guids = client.dataframe.create("opportunity", df_new_records)
```

See **dv-query** for the full `client.dataframe` write reference; for reads use `client.query.builder(...).execute().to_dataframe()`.

---

## Upsert (Alternate Keys)

Idempotent — re-running the same import does not create duplicates. The alternate key must be defined on the table first — see **dv-metadata**.

**Do NOT include alternate key columns in the record body.** The alternate key identifies the record; the record body contains the data to set. If the same column appears in both, `UpsertMultiple` fails with "An unexpected error occurred" (single upsert tolerates it, bulk does not).

```python
from PowerPlatform.Dataverse.models.upsert import UpsertItem

client.records.upsert("account", [
    UpsertItem(
        alternate_key={"accountnumber": "ACC-001"},
        record={"name": "Contoso Ltd", "description": "Primary account"},
    ),
    UpsertItem(
        alternate_key={"accountnumber": "ACC-002"},
        record={"name": "Fabrikam Inc"},
    ),
])
```

---

## Bulk Import from CSV

> **For imports that may be re-run** (most real-world cases), use `UpsertItem` with alternate keys instead of `create()` — see [`references/multi-table-fk-import.md`](references/multi-table-fk-import.md). The `create()` pattern here is for one-shot loads only.

| Volume | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1–10 records | MCP `create_record` | Simple, no script |
| 10+ records | SDK `client.records.create(table, list)` | Uses CreateMultiple; chunk large datasets (start at 1K, adapt) |

```python
import csv, os, sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "scripts"))
from auth import get_client

# get_client sets a plugin attribution context on the User-Agent header.
# Do not modify the context value — it is a closed schema for server-side
# telemetry (app/skill/agent). Never include secrets or PII.
client = get_client("dv-data")

with open("data/customers.csv", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    rows = list(csv.DictReader(f))

records = [{"new_name": row["name"], "new_email": row["email"]} for row in rows]

# SDK sends all in one POST — chunk to avoid payload/timeout limits
# Start at 1000; for narrow tables (few columns) you can go higher
chunk_size = 1000
for i in range(0, len(records), chunk_size):
    guids = client.records.create("new_customer", records[i:i + chunk_size])
    print(f"Imported {i + len(guids)}/{len(records)} customers", flush=True)
```

### Lookup resolution during import

If the CSV has a human-readable key (e.g., `customer_email`) but Dataverse needs a GUID, pre-resolve with a lookup dict:

```python
# Build email -> GUID map first
email_to_guid = {}
for r in client.records.list("new_customer", select=["new_customerid", "new_email"]):
    email_to_guid[r["new_email"]] = r["new_customerid"]

# Use it during import
records = []
for row in rows:
    customer_guid = email_to_guid.get(row["customer_email"])
    if not customer_guid:
        print(f"Skipping row — unknown email: {row['customer_email']}")
        continue
    records.append({
        "new_channel": row["channel"],
        "new_CustomerId@odata.bind": f"/new_customers({customer_guid})",  # verify entity set name via EntityDefinitions
    })

guids = client.records.create("new_interaction", records)
```

### Required field discovery for system tables

Before bulk-creating in a system table (account, contact, opportunity):
1. Create a single test record with your intended minimal payload
2. If `HttpError` 400 is raised, the error message names the missing required field
3. Some required fields are plugin-enforced and not visible in `describe`
4. Delete the test record, then proceed with bulk create

---

## Multi-Table Import with FK Dependencies

When importing data across multiple tables with foreign key relationships, the import must run in dependency order with `UpsertItem` + alternate keys (idempotent, safe for re-runs).

**Quick reference:**
1. Create tables with source ID columns + alternate keys + lookup relationships (see **dv-metadata**).
2. Import Level 0 (no FK deps) tables in parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Sequential chunks within each table (concurrent writes deadlock).
3. Build source-ID → GUID maps by querying back (upsert doesn't return GUIDs).
4. Repeat per dependency level — Level 1 needs Level 0's maps for `@odata.bind`.

For the full pattern — adaptive `bulk_upsert` helper, composite-key handling, post-import verification, and the first-time `bulk_create` variant — see [`references/multi-table-fk-import.md`](references/multi-table-fk-import.md).

Key invariants (apply even without reading the reference):

- **Parallelize across tables at the same level**, sequential between levels, sequential chunks within a table.
- **Alternate key columns must NOT also appear in the record body** — `UpsertMultiple` fails.
- **Catch per-table failures** in the executor — one table failing must not kill the others.
- Start `chunk_size=1000`; the helper ramps up adaptively.

## Error Handling

```python
from PowerPlatform.Dataverse.core.errors import HttpError

try:
    guid = client.records.create("new_ticket", {"new_name": "Test"})
except HttpError as e:
    print(f"Status {e.status_code}: {e.message}")
    if e.details:
        print(f"Details: {e.details}")
    # 400 — bad field name, @odata.bind format, or missing required field
    # 403 — check security roles
    # 404 — table or record not found
    # 429 — rate limited; SDK retries automatically, reduce batch size if persistent
```

## Writing ERP data

On ERP-linked envs, writes to ERP entities do not go through the Python SDK. See [`references/erp-writes.md`](references/erp-writes.md).

---

## Windows Scripting Notes

- **ASCII only** in `.py` files — curly quotes and em dashes cause `SyntaxError` on Windows.
- **No `python -c` for multiline code** — write a `.py` file instead.
- **Generate GUIDs in scripts**: `str(uuid.uuid4())`, not shell backtick substitution.

---

## Sample Data Generation

Generate realistic sample records inline — schema-driven, table-agnostic, PII-safe defaults (`@example.com` emails, `555-01xx` phones).

**Quick reference:** confirm environment + count + table → query `EntityDefinitions(LogicalName='<table>')/Attributes?$filter=AttributeOf eq null` for required columns → dispatch by `AttributeType` (String / Memo / Integer / DateTime / Picklist / etc.) → `client.records.create()` (use `CreateMultiple` for count >= 10).

For the schema-driven `fake()` template, the `EntityDefinitions` query, and the safety rules, see [`references/sample-data-generation.md`](references/sample-data-generation.md).

Key invariants:
- Skip Lookup, Uniqueidentifier, State, Status, Owner, Customer fields unless the user explicitly provides values.
- `UserLocalizedLabel` may be null — dereference safely.

### Confirmation-flow examples

**Generate N sample records (destructive — preview the snippet, ask for env):**
- ❌ "Which environment should I target? Please provide the Dataverse URL."
- ✅ "I'll run the Sample Data Generation snippets with `TABLE=\"contact\"`, `COUNT=20`. Uses `CreateMultiple`, `.example.com` emails, `555-01xx` phones, against the active `pac auth list` environment. Confirm to proceed, or specify a different environment."

**Sample data on a custom entity (schema unknown — prose is enough):**
- ❌ "I need more info about the entity. What are the required fields?"
- ✅ "Custom entity — I'll query `EntityDefinitions` for `cr123_project` to discover required columns, then generate 5 records inline mapping each column to a generator by `AttributeType` and call `client.records.create(\"cr123_project\", records)`. Confirm to proceed, or tell me a different count."
