# Skill: Finance and Operations X++ Development

> ## Critical safety rules — read first
>
> 1. **Windows only.** `pac tool xpp install` and `pac package compile --package-type erp` require Windows. Do not invent a Linux/macOS or SDK-based fallback.
> 2. **Confirm the target before any deploy or DB sync.** Show the Dataverse environment URL, obtain explicit confirmation, then run `pac org who --environment <url>` and verify both the Dataverse URL and linked ERP URL/version.
> 3. **Never assume Full DB sync.** Although standalone `pac package db-sync` defaults to `Full`, require the user to choose `Full`, `Module`, or `Incremental` when the request is ambiguous.
> 4. **Do not call deployment successful until PAC reaches a successful terminal state.** Preserve and report the async operation ID on failure.
> 5. **Do not overwrite existing models or source files.** Inspect `.erp/xpp.json`, descriptors, and target metadata paths before scaffolding or editing.
> 6. **Pin every runtime surface before ERP verification.** PAC and the Dataverse CLI have separate active profiles. Before any `dataverse ... --target erp` check, require `dataverse auth who` and `dataverse org who --json` to match the confirmed Dataverse and linked ERP URLs. Validate ERP MCP according to its transport: direct HTTP must target `<erp-url>/mcp`; an stdio proxy must receive the base `<erp-url>` and route effectively to `/mcp`. Profile selection does not retarget an existing MCP connection.
> 7. **Treat runtime verification as possible data mutation.** After the separate post-deployment opt-in, inspect the X++ implementation, disclose exact test inputs and expected mutations, and obtain confirmation for those inputs and effects. Do not apply a generic test matrix to non-idempotent operations.
> 8. **All additional validation after an ERP X++ package deployment is opt-in.** After `pac package deploy --package-type erp`, capture PAC's terminal result, then ask whether the user wants any further validation and which checks to run. Do not query the async operation, execute an X++ artifact, query its ERP entity, or test its security unless selected. For runtime validation, confirm exact inputs, success criteria, and failure criteria; never invent values or execute an unapproved failure path. This rule is scoped to ERP X++ package deployment, not Dataverse solution ALM.

PAC CLI is the managed surface for the X++ lifecycle. Do not replace these commands with raw Dataverse APIs, direct calls to the ERP sidecar, LCS upload automation, or hand-written compiler invocations.

For a planning-only X++ request, loading skills and reading local references is allowed; do not make environment calls or write local files.

## Intent routing

| User intent | Action |
|---|---|
| Create an ERP package/model | `pac package init --package-type erp` |
| Install compiler metadata for an environment | `pac tool xpp install` |
| Check/remove local SDKs | `pac tool xpp list` / `pac tool xpp uninstall` |
| Compile or build X++ | `pac package compile --package-type erp` |
| Deploy one prebuilt ZIP | `pac package deploy --package-type erp --package <zip>` |
| Deploy all models in a repo | `pac package deploy --package-type erp --solution-root <root>` |
| Run DB sync only | `pac package db-sync` |
| Create an ERP custom service | Author its X++ class/contracts plus `AxService` and `AxServiceGroup` metadata, then compile and deploy |
| Create an ERP `ICustomAPI` action | Author an `ICustomAPI` class, action menu item, and privilege/duty/role security, then compile, deploy, DB-sync when required, and verify through ERP MCP |
| Author, compile, deploy, and verify | Follow [End-to-end workflow](#end-to-end-workflow) |

**There is no `pac package build` or top-level `pac xpp` command.** For ERP, `pac package compile --package-type erp` compiles labels and X++, runs best-practice checks, and builds deployable managed ZIPs.

## Skill boundaries

| Need | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Connect/authenticate, install or update PAC CLI | **dv-connect** |
| Read or analyze ERP business data | **dv-query** |
| Create/update/delete ERP business records or import DMF data | **dv-data** |
| List/cancel ERP batch jobs | **dv-admin** |
| Dataverse solution ALM | **dv-solution** |
| ERP UI personalization, workflow editing, or environment lifecycle | Finance and Operations UI / Power Platform admin tooling; not covered |

## Preflight

1. Confirm Windows.
2. Run `pac` and inspect its banner; `pac --version` is invalid. These commands require the PAC CLI .NET tool version 2.11.1 or later.
3. Run `pac package help` and `pac tool xpp help`. If `compile`, `db-sync`, or `tool xpp` is absent, load **dv-connect** and update to the latest .NET tool installation before continuing.
4. For environment operations, run:

```bash
pac auth list
pac org who --environment <dataverse-url>
```

The output must identify the confirmed Dataverse environment and include a linked ERP URL/version. Do not substitute the ERP URL for `--environment`; PAC accepts the Dataverse URL and resolves ERP linkage.

5. Before runtime verification through the Dataverse CLI or ERP MCP, run:

```bash
dataverse auth who
dataverse org who --json \
  --context "app=dataverse-skills/<ver>;skill=erp-xpp;agent=<agent>"
```

Require the selected CLI profile's environment URL and returned `erpUrl` to match the PAC target confirmed above. If they do not, run `dataverse auth select --name <profile-name>`, then repeat both checks. Pass `--environment <dataverse-url>` on commands that support it, but never treat that option as a substitute for selecting the correct profile; some ERP data commands have no environment override.

For ERP MCP verification, inspect the active server configuration. Require direct HTTP to use the confirmed `<erp-url>/mcp`, or require an stdio proxy such as `dataverse mcp` to receive the confirmed base `<erp-url>` and use its effective `/mcp` endpoint. If it differs, stop and reconnect or reinitialize the matching ERP MCP server before discovery or invocation.

Before every MCP runtime invocation, establish a fresh transport-specific session and verify its caller through an MCP-originated identity/current-session check. `dataverse auth who` proves only the CLI identity. If MCP cannot prove its caller, do not invoke through that session. For security acceptance, the proven caller must be the intended non-administrator test user.

6. Before a first SDK install, explain that it downloads roughly 4 GB and expands to roughly 16 GB under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Dynamics365\<version>\PackagesLocalDirectory`.

## Command quick reference

```bash
# Scaffold one or more models
pac package init --outputDirectory <root> --package-type erp \
  --model <ModelA,ModelB> --publisher <publisher> --layer ISV

# SDK lifecycle
pac tool xpp install --environment <dataverse-url>
pac tool xpp list
pac tool xpp uninstall --version <four-part-version>

# Compile/build all configured models
pac package compile --solution-root <root> --package-type erp \
  --app-version <four-part-version> --language en-US

# Compile one model during the edit loop
pac package compile --solution-root <root> --package-type erp \
  --model <ModelName> --app-version <four-part-version> \
  --language en-US --incremental

# Deploy one compiled package, without DB sync
pac package deploy --environment <dataverse-url> --package-type erp \
  --package <root>/bin/<Model>_<version>_managed.zip \
  --build-type Full --release-type Dev --db-sync None \
  --logConsole --logFile <deployment-log-path>

# Deploy every model in .erp/xpp.json in dependency order
pac package deploy --environment <dataverse-url> --package-type erp \
  --solution-root <root> --build-type Full --release-type Dev \
  --db-sync None --logConsole --logFile <deployment-log-path>
```

Use explicit values rather than relying on defaults in automation. Full argument tables and DB-sync rules are in [`references/commands.md`](references/commands.md).

## Authoring X++ source

The repo root contains `.erp/xpp.json`; source defaults to `src/`. Each model has a descriptor and metadata under:

```text
<root>/
  .erp/xpp.json
  src/<Model>/Descriptor/<Model>.xml
  src/<Model>/<Model>/AxClass/<Class>.xml
```

Run `pac package init` instead of hand-writing the descriptor/config. Add metadata files surgically after inspecting existing paths. PAC compiles and packages authored metadata; it does not scaffold custom services, `ICustomAPI` actions, or data entities. For runnable classes, labels, custom services, `ICustomAPI` actions, public OData data entities, and artifact-specific verification, use [`references/authoring.md`](references/authoring.md).

## Compile/build rules

- A normal compile runs labels -> X++ -> best-practice checks -> deployable ZIP.
- Use `--incremental` only for the edit loop. Run a non-incremental compile before a final deployment.
- Do not use `--skip-bp` unless the user explicitly requests it and understands the reduced validation.
- If multiple SDKs are installed, pass `--app-version`; otherwise PAC may reject ambiguous selection.
- Treat `Compile summary: ... failed` or any nonzero exit as failure even if a ZIP already exists from an earlier run.
- Verify the output ZIP was produced by the current run under `<root>/bin/`.
- If label compilation reports `XPPLC2010` and PAC fails despite exit code 0 from LabelC, add a valid label resource; do not delete logs or bypass the stage.

## Deploy and DB-sync rules

- **Deploy-only** means `--db-sync None`.
- `--build-type` controls how the server applies the package: `Full`, `Incremental`, or `Delete`; it is not a local build command.
- `--release-type Dev` is the normal test/development choice. `Release` forces Full DB sync server-side when a sync is requested.
- `Delete` ignores DB-sync settings.
- Single-package deployment uses `--package <zip>`. Solution-mode deployment omits `--package`, reads `.erp/xpp.json`, topologically orders models, deploys them, then runs one requested DB sync.
- PAC injects `fnomoduledefinition.json` into the ZIP at deploy time. Copy the artifact first if an immutable checksum must be retained.
- Standalone DB sync and deploy-with-sync are separate supported workflows; never redeploy merely to satisfy a DB-sync-only request.

See [`references/workflows.md`](references/workflows.md) for compile-only, deploy-only, DB-sync-only, multi-model, and full lifecycle sequences. Apply the success gates, diagnostics flow, and error mappings in [`references/validation.md`](references/validation.md) to every compile, deployment, DB sync, and runtime verification.

## End-to-end workflow

For “make this X++ change and deploy it”:

1. Inspect the repo and preserve existing work.
2. Confirm model/class names, publisher, and layer before scaffolding a new model.
3. Run `pac package init --package-type erp` only when the model does not exist.
4. Add or edit the requested X++ metadata, such as classes, contracts, custom services, service groups, `ICustomAPI` actions and security, public data entities, and required labels.
5. Confirm/authenticate the target environment and verify ERP linkage/version.
6. Install or reuse the matching SDK.
7. Compile non-incrementally and require zero compile errors. Address best-practice warnings unless the user accepts them.
8. Deploy with explicit build/release/DB-sync modes.
9. Capture PAC's exit code, async operation ID, terminal state, and DB-sync result as part of the deployment command. Do not run additional validation automatically.
10. Ask whether the user wants post-deployment validation and which checks they authorize: async-operation re-query, API/action discovery, runtime behavior, data-entity query, multiple-case testing, and/or security acceptance. Earlier deployment approval and selection of one check do not authorize another.
11. If all validation is declined, report the PAC deployment result and state that no additional validation was performed. If runtime validation is selected, inspect only the deployed custom artifact and its contract, then ask for each required input plus the expected success and failure criteria. Repeat exact values or criteria already in the prompt for confirmation; never invent or broaden them.
12. For selected runtime checks, pin the Dataverse CLI profile and transport-specific ERP MCP target to the confirmed environment, then verify only the approved artifact:
   - Runnable class: open `https://<erp-host>/?mi=SysClassRunner&cls=<ClassName>`.
   - Custom service: inspect the X++ implementation for side effects before invoking `erp:<ServiceGroup>/<Service>/<Operation>` with `dataverse api invoke --target erp --context "app=dataverse-skills/<ver>;skill=erp-xpp;agent=<agent>"`; use `list`/`describe` only for discovery.
   - `ICustomAPI` action: if discovery was selected, use ERP MCP `api_find_actions` to validate its action menu item and contract. If execution was selected, invoke only approved inputs using the confirmed source contract or approved discovery result, then compare every returned property and expected mutation with the observed result.
   - Public OData data entity: if discovery was selected, inspect it with `dataverse data describe --target erp`. If query execution was selected, query the confirmed entity set with `dataverse data query --target erp`. Add `--context "app=dataverse-skills/<ver>;skill=erp-xpp;agent=<agent>"` to each command that runs.
   - Security acceptance: only when runtime execution and security acceptance were both selected, invoke the approved case as a non-administrator test user assigned the intended custom role. Administrator execution is diagnostic only and does not validate the privilege/duty/role chain.
13. Report the package path, environment, async operation ID, terminal status, DB-sync mode, the validation checks accepted or declined, and results only for checks actually performed.

## Common mistakes — do not use these

| Wrong | Correct |
|---|---|
| `pac xpp install` | `pac tool xpp install` |
| `pac xpp compile` | `pac package compile --package-type erp` |
| `pac package build` | `pac package compile --package-type erp` |
| `pac package deploy --package-type xpp` | `--package-type erp` |
