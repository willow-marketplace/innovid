# Skill: Overview — What to Use and When

This skill provides cross-cutting context that no individual skill owns: tool capabilities, UX principles, and the skill index. Per-task routing is handled by each skill's WHEN/DO NOT USE WHEN frontmatter triggers — not duplicated here.

---

## Hard Rules — Read These First

These rules are non-negotiable. Violating any of them means the task is going off-rails.

### 0. Check Init State Before Anything Else

Before writing ANY code or creating ANY files, check if the workspace is initialized:

```bash
ls .env scripts/auth.py 2>/dev/null
```

- If BOTH exist: workspace is initialized. Proceed to the relevant task.
- If EITHER is missing: **Automatically run the connect flow** (see the `dv-connect` skill). Do NOT ask the user whether to initialize — just do it. Do not create your own `.env`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, or auth scripts. The `dv-connect` skill handles all of this.

Do NOT create `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, or scaffold files manually. The connect flow produces the correct file structure. Skipping it is the #1 cause of broken setups.

### 1. Python Only — No Exceptions

All scripts, data operations, and automation MUST use **Python**. This plugin's entire toolchain — `scripts/auth.py`, the Dataverse SDK, all skill examples — is Python-based.

**NEVER:**
- Run `npm init`, `npm install`, or any Node.js/JavaScript tooling
- Install packages via `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- Write scripts in JavaScript, TypeScript, PowerShell, or any language other than Python
- Use `@azure/msal-node`, `@azure/identity`, or any Node.js Azure SDK
- Import or reference `node_modules/`

**ALWAYS:**
- Use `pip install` for Python packages
- Use `scripts/auth.py` for authentication tokens and credentials
- Use the Python Dataverse SDK (`PowerPlatform-Dataverse-Client`) for data and schema operations
- Use `azure-identity` (Python) for Azure credential flows

If you find yourself about to run `npm` or create a `package.json`, STOP. You are going off-rails. Re-read Hard Rule 1 above.

### 2. MCP → SDK → Web API (in that order)

**Before writing ANY code, ask: can MCP handle this?** If MCP tools are available in your tool list (`list_tables`, `describe_table`, `read_query`, `create_record`, etc.):

- **Writes:** ≤10 records → use MCP directly. 10+ records → use Python SDK (`dv-data`).
- **Reads:** Simple filter, small result set (no paging needed) → use MCP. Multi-page iteration, DataFrame loading, aggregation, or queries hitting SQL limits (DISTINCT, HAVING, subqueries) → use Python SDK (`dv-query`).

Examples where MCP is sufficient: "how many accounts have 'jeff' in the name?", "show me the columns on the contact table", "create an account named Contoso."

**If MCP can't handle it** (bulk operations, large reads, schema creation, multi-step workflows, analytics, or MCP tools aren't available), **use the Python SDK — not raw HTTP.** This is the most common mistake agents make.

**SDK checklist — evaluate EVERY time you write a script:**
- Creating/updating/deleting records? → `client.records.create()`, `.update()`, `.delete()` — see `dv-data`
- Bulk record operations? → `client.records.create(table, [list_of_dicts])` — see `dv-data`
- Querying or filtering records? → `client.records.get(table, select=[...], filter="...")` — see `dv-query`
- Aggregation (top-N, sum, count by group, "most/least")? → Single-table: `$apply` server-side aggregation (raw Web API). Cross-table: `client.dataframe.get()` with `$select` + `pd.merge()` — see `dv-query`. Do NOT load all records without `$select` and aggregate in Python.
- Loading data into pandas? → `client.dataframe.get(table)` — see `dv-query`
- Single record by GUID? → `client.records.get(table, guid)` — see `dv-query`
- Creating tables, columns, relationships? → `client.tables.create()`, `.add_columns()`, `.create_lookup_field()` — see `dv-metadata`
- Creating publishers or solutions? → `client.records.create("publisher", {...})`, `client.records.create("solution", {...})` — see `dv-solution`

**Before using `from auth import get_token` or `import requests`:** check whether the operation is in the Raw Web API list below. If it is not in that list — the SDK supports it — use `from auth import get_client` instead. Using raw HTTP for SDK-supported operations is the most common off-rails mistake.

**Raw Web API (`get_token()`) is ONLY acceptable for:** forms, views, global option sets, N:N `$ref` associations, N:N `$expand`, `$apply` aggregation, memo columns, and unbound actions. Everything else MUST use MCP (if available) or the SDK.

**NEVER use raw Web API (`get_token()` / `urllib` / `requests`) for:**
- Record CRUD or bulk operations — use `client.records.create()`, `.update()`, `.delete()` (see `dv-data`)
- Publisher or solution creation — use `client.records.create("publisher", {...})` (see `dv-solution`)
- Table, column, or relationship creation — use `client.tables.create()`, `.add_columns()`, `.create_lookup_field()` (see `dv-metadata`)
- Querying records — use `client.records.get()` or `client.query.builder()` (see `dv-query`)

If an SDK method fails or a PAC CLI command doesn't exist, **consult the relevant skill** before falling back to raw HTTP. Improvising raw Web API calls is the #1 cause of off-rails behavior.

**Field casing:** `$select`/`$filter` use lowercase logical names (`new_name`). `$expand` and `@odata.bind` use Navigation Property Names that are case-sensitive and must match `$metadata` (e.g., `new_AccountId`). Getting this wrong causes 400 errors. **SDK record payloads:** pre-b6 the SDK accidentally lowercased `@odata.bind` keys; b6+ no longer does — but you must still provide the correct SchemaName casing (e.g., `new_AccountId@odata.bind`). The SDK does not auto-correct wrong casing. **Raw Web API calls** (forms, views, metadata): casing is entirely manual — a lowercase `new_accountid@odata.bind` will 400.

**Publisher prefix:** Never hardcode a prefix (especially not `new`). Always query existing publishers in the environment and ask the user which to use. The prefix is permanent on every component created with it. See the solution skill's publisher discovery flow.

### 3. Use Documented Auth Patterns

Authentication is handled by `pac auth create` (for PAC CLI) and `scripts/auth.py` (for Python scripts and the SDK).

**NEVER:**
- Read or parse raw token cache files (e.g., `tokencache_msalv3.dat`)
- Implement your own MSAL device-code flow
- Hard-code tokens or credentials in scripts
- Invent a new auth mechanism

If auth is expired or missing, re-run `pac auth create` or check `.env` credentials. See the `dv-connect` skill.

### 4. Follow Skill Instructions, Don't Improvise

Each skill documents a specific, tested sequence of steps. Follow them. If a skill says "use the Python SDK," use the Python SDK — do not substitute a raw HTTP call, a different library, or a different language. If a skill says "run this command," run that command — do not invent an alternative.

**Do NOT introspect the SDK** with `dir()`, `inspect.signature()`, or `help()` to discover APIs. The skills document the exact methods and parameters to use. If a method call fails with `AttributeError`, the installed SDK version may not have it — check the version note in the skill and fall back to the documented alternative. Introspecting the SDK wastes time and leads to using deprecated or internal APIs.

If you hit a gap (something the skills don't cover), say so honestly and suggest a workaround. Do not hallucinate a path or improvise a solution using tools the skills don't mention.

---

## UX Principle: Natural Language First

Users should never need to invoke skills or slash commands directly. The intended workflow is:

1. Install the plugin
2. Describe what you want in plain English
3. The agent figures out the right sequence of tools, APIs, and scripts

**Example prompt:** *"I want to create an extension called IronHandle for Dynamics CRM in this Git repo folder that adds a 'nickname' column to the account table and populates it with a clever nickname every time a new account is created."*

From that single prompt, the agent should orchestrate the full sequence: check if the workspace is initialized → create metadata via Web API → write and deploy a C# plugin → pull the solution to the repo. No skill names, no commands — just intent.

Skills exist as **the agent's knowledge**, not as user-facing commands. Each skill documents how to do one thing well. The agent chains them together based on what the user describes. If a capability gap exists (e.g., prompt columns aren't programmatically creatable yet), say so honestly and suggest workarounds rather than hallucinating a path.

---

## Multi-Environment Rule (MANDATORY)

Pro-dev scenarios involve multiple environments (dev, test, staging, prod) and multiple sets of credentials. **Never assume** the active PAC auth profile, values in `.env`, or anything from memory or a previous session reflects the correct target for the current task.

**Before the FIRST operation that touches a specific environment** — creating a table, deploying a plugin, pushing a solution, inserting data — you MUST:

1. Show the user the environment URL you intend to use
2. Ask them to confirm it is correct
3. Run `pac org who` to verify the active connection matches

> "I'm about to make changes to `<URL>`. Is this the correct target environment?"

**Do not proceed until the user explicitly confirms.** This is the single most important safety check in the plugin. Skipping it risks making irreversible changes to the wrong environment.

Once confirmed for a session, you do not need to re-confirm for every subsequent operation in the same session against the same environment.

## What This Plugin Covers

This plugin covers **Dataverse / Power Platform development**: solutions, tables, columns, forms, views, and data operations (CRUD, bulk, analytics).

It does **not** cover:

- Power Automate flows (use the maker portal or Power Automate Management API)
- Canvas apps (use `pac canvas` or the maker portal)
- Azure infrastructure beyond what's needed for service principal setup
- Business Central or other Dynamics products

## Tool Capabilities — Which Tool for Which Job

Understanding the real limits of each tool prevents hallucinated paths. This is the one piece of context no individual skill owns.

| Tool | Use for | Does NOT support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MCP Server** | Data CRUD (create/read/update/delete records), table create/update/delete/list/describe, column add via `update_table`, keyword search, single-record fetch | Forms, Views, Relationships, Option Sets, Solutions. **Note:** table creation may timeout but still succeed — always `describe_table` before retrying. Run queries sequentially (parallel calls timeout). Column names with spaces normalize to underscores (e.g., `"Specialty Area"` → `cr9ac_specialty_area`). **SQL limitations:** The `read_query` tool uses Dataverse SQL, which does NOT support: `DISTINCT`, `HAVING`, subqueries, `OFFSET`, `UNION`, `CASE`/`IF`, `CAST`/`CONVERT`, or date functions. For analytical queries that need these (e.g., finding duplicates, unmatched records, filtered aggregates), use `$apply` (single-table aggregation) or `client.dataframe.get()` with pandas (cross-table) — see `dv-query`. **Bulk operations:** MCP `create_record` creates one record at a time. For 10+ records, use the Python SDK `CreateMultiple` instead — see `dv-data`. |
| **Python SDK (`dv-data`)** | **Preferred for all scripted data writes.** Record CRUD, upsert (alternate keys), bulk create/update/upsert (CreateMultiple/UpdateMultiple/UpsertMultiple), CSV import with lookup resolution, file column uploads (chunked >128MB) | Forms, Views, global Option Sets, record association (`$ref`), `$apply` aggregation, N:N `$expand`, table/column/relationship creation (use `dv-metadata`), custom action invocation |
| **Python SDK (`dv-query`)** | **Preferred for bulk reads and analytics.** Multi-page record iteration, OData queries (select/filter/expand/orderby), QueryBuilder fluent API (b8+), GUID-free display (formatted values), `$expand` to resolve lookups, pandas DataFrame handoff (`client.dataframe.get()`) for cross-table joins and exports, Jupyter notebook snippets | `$apply` aggregation (use Web API), N:N `$expand` (use Web API) |
| **Web API** | Everything — forms, views, relationships, option sets, columns, table definitions, unbound actions, `$ref` association | Nothing (full MetadataService + OData access) |
| **PAC CLI** | Solution export/import/pack/unpack, environment create/list/delete/reset, auth profile management, plugin updates (`pac plugin push` — first-time registration requires Web API), user/role assignment (`pac admin assign-user`), solution component management | Data CRUD, metadata creation (tables/columns/forms) |
| **Azure CLI** | App registrations, service principals, credential management | Dataverse-specific operations |
| **GitHub CLI** | Repo management, GitHub secrets, Actions workflow status | Dataverse-specific operations |

**Tool priority (always follow this order):** MCP for simple reads/queries (small result set, no paging) and ≤10 record writes → Python SDK for bulk reads, scripted writes, bulk operations, and analysis → Web API for operations the SDK doesn't cover (forms, views, option sets, `$apply`, N:N `$expand`) → PAC CLI for solution lifecycle. Schema creation (tables/columns/relationships) → SDK via `dv-metadata`. MCP tools not in your tool list? → Load `dv-connect` to set them up (see below).

**Volume guidance — writes:** MCP `create_record` for 1-10 records. For 10+ records, use `dv-data` (`client.records.create(table, list_of_dicts)`) — it uses `CreateMultiple` internally. **Note:** the SDK does not chunk automatically; for large datasets, chunk in your script starting at 1,000 and adapt up or down based on success (see `dv-data` for the adaptive pattern).

**Volume guidance — reads:** MCP `read_query` for simple filters and small result sets (no paging needed). For bulk reads (multi-page iteration, all-records loads, DataFrame handoff), use `dv-query` SDK — it streams pages automatically and avoids MCP SQL limitations. For aggregation queries (`$apply`), use the Web API directly (see `dv-query`).

Note: The Python SDK is in **preview** — breaking changes possible.

### MCP Availability Check

If the user's request involves MCP — either explicitly ("connect via MCP", "use MCP", "query via MCP") or implicitly (conversational data queries where MCP would be the natural tool) — check whether Dataverse MCP tools are available in your current tool list (e.g., `list_tables`, `describe_table`, `read_query`, `create_record`).

**If MCP tools are NOT available and the user explicitly asked for MCP** (e.g., "use MCP to query", "why isn't MCP working"):
1. **Do NOT silently fall back** to the Python SDK or Web API
2. Tell the user: "Dataverse MCP tools aren't configured in this session yet."
3. Load the `dv-connect` skill to set up the MCP server
4. After MCP is configured, **stop here** — the session must be restarted for MCP tools to appear. Remind the user to resume the session without losing context (Claude Code: `claude --continue`; Cursor: reload the window with Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"; Copilot: reopen the Copilot panel). Do not proceed with SDK. Wait for the user to restart.

**If MCP tools are NOT available and the user asked a data question without explicitly requesting MCP** (e.g., "how many accounts with 'jeff'?", "show me open tickets"):
1. This is a SDK fallback case — use the Python SDK to answer the question. Do not block the user.
2. After answering, offer: "MCP would handle this conversationally — want me to set it up?"

The distinction matters: explicit MCP request → block and set up MCP. Implicit/conversational question → answer with SDK, offer MCP setup.

**If MCP tools ARE available**, prefer MCP for simple reads/queries/small CRUD. Use the SDK only when a script is needed.

## Available Skills

Each skill's frontmatter contains WHEN/DO NOT USE WHEN triggers that the agent uses for automatic routing. This index is for human reference only.

| Skill | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| **dv-connect** | Connect to Dataverse: install tools, authenticate, create `.env`, configure MCP, verify connection |
| **dv-metadata** | Create/modify tables, columns, relationships (SDK), forms and views (Web API) |
| **dv-data** | Record CRUD, bulk create/update/upsert, CSV import with lookup resolution, multi-table FK-ordered import, file uploads, alternate key upserts, sample data generation |
| **dv-query** | Bulk reads, multi-page iteration, OData queries, QueryBuilder, `$expand`, `$apply` aggregation (Web API), GUID-free display, pandas DataFrame handoff, Jupyter notebook snippets |
| **dv-solution** | Solution create/export/import/pack/unpack, post-import validation |
| **dv-admin** | Bulk delete, data retention/archival, org settings (audit, plugin trace, session timeout), OrgDB settings (MCP, search, copilot, fabric), recycle bin. PAC CLI for bulk delete/retention/org settings; Python SDK for OrgDB XML and recycle bin. Multi-environment: parallel with `&` and `wait` |
| **dv-security** | Role assignment (`pac admin assign-user`), self-elevation (`pac admin self-elevate`). **PAC CLI only** |

---

## Scripts

The plugin ships utility scripts in `scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `auth.py` | Azure Identity token/credential acquisition — used by all other scripts and the SDK |

For data write operations (create, update, bulk import), see `dv-data`. For queries, aggregation, and analytics, see `dv-query`. For post-import validation queries, see `dv-solution`.

Any Web API call that goes beyond a one-off query should be written as a Python script and committed to `/scripts/`. Use `scripts/auth.py` for token acquisition.

---

## Windows Scripting Rules

When running in a Unix-style shell on Windows (Git Bash is the default for Claude Code on Windows; Cursor and Copilot may use PowerShell — the same rules apply, adapt path/quoting syntax as needed):

- **ASCII only in `.py` files.** Curly quotes, em dashes, or other non-ASCII characters cause `SyntaxError`. Use straight quotes and regular dashes.
- **No `python -c` for multiline code.** Shell quoting differences between Git Bash and CMD break multiline `python -c` commands. Write a `.py` file instead.
- **PAC CLI may need a PowerShell wrapper.** If `pac` hangs or fails in Git Bash, use `powershell -Command "& pac.cmd <args>"`. See the setup skill for details.
- **Generate GUIDs in Python scripts**, not via shell backtick-substitution: `str(uuid.uuid4())` inside the `.py` file.
- **Background job output may be empty on Windows.** Agent background task runners on Windows (e.g., Claude Code's "Running in the background") can silently produce no output. Always use `python -u` (unbuffered stdout) and `print(..., flush=True)` in long-running scripts. For foreground execution with logging: `python -u scripts/import_data.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/out.txt`. Do NOT assume a background task succeeded just because it appeared to finish.

---

## Before Any Metadata Change: Confirm Solution

Before creating tables, columns, or other metadata, ensure a solution exists to contain the work:

1. Ask the user: "What solution should these components go into?"
2. If a solution name is in `.env` (`SOLUTION_NAME`), confirm it with the user
3. If no solution exists yet, **load the `dv-solution` skill** and follow its publisher discovery + solution creation flow. Use the SDK — **never raw Web API** — to create publisher and solution records:

```python
# Quick reference — full pattern with publisher discovery is in dv-solution
publisher_id = client.records.create("publisher", {
    "uniquename": "<name>", "friendlyname": "<display>",
    "customizationprefix": "<prefix>", "description": "<desc>",
})
solution_id = client.records.create("solution", {
    "uniquename": "<Name>", "friendlyname": "<Display>",
    "version": "1.0.0.0",
    "publisherid@odata.bind": f"/publishers({publisher_id})",
})
```

4. Pass `solution="<UniqueName>"` on all SDK calls, or include `"MSCRM.SolutionName": "<UniqueName>"` header on raw Web API metadata calls.

Creating metadata without a solution means it exists only in the default solution and cannot be cleanly exported or deployed. Always solution-first.

---

## After Any Change: Pull to Repo (MANDATORY)

Any time you make a metadata change (via MCP, Web API, or the maker portal), **you must** end the session by pulling:

```bash
pac solution export --name <SOLUTION_NAME> --path ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip --managed false
pac solution unpack --zipfile ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip --folder ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>
rm ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>.zip
git add ./solutions/<SOLUTION_NAME>
git commit -m "feat: <description>"
git push
```

The repo is always the source of truth.
