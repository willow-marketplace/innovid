# Qdrant Monitoring

Route first, then answer. Match the user's symptom in the table, `Read` that file, and answer from it.
Do not answer from this page alone: it contains routing only, not the guidance. If two rows match, read both.

| The user says | Read |
|---|---|
| Want to set up Prometheus, Grafana, or health checks | `setup/SKILL.md` |
| Need to know which metrics to track | `setup/SKILL.md` |
| Setting up alerting, log centralization, or Hybrid Cloud metrics | `setup/SKILL.md` |
| Optimizer stuck or running forever | `debugging/SKILL.md` |
| Memory keeps growing in production | `debugging/SKILL.md` |
| Requests are slow and I need to find out why | `debugging/SKILL.md` |
| Is Qdrant healthy right now | `debugging/SKILL.md` |

Qdrant monitoring tracks performance and health, and catches issues before they become outages. See the metric reference before tuning anything:
