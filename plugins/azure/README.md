# Azure Skills Plugin

Azure work is not just a code problem. It is a decision problem: which service fits this app, what needs to be validated before deployment, which tools should run, and what guardrails matter. The Azure Skills Plugin packages Azure expertise and MCP-backed execution together so compatible coding agents can do real Azure work instead of giving generic cloud advice.

## One install, three layers of capability

### Azure skills: the brain

This plugin ships **curated Azure skills** that teach an agent how Azure work gets done. They provide workflows, decision trees, and guardrails for scenarios such as:

- **Build, deploy, and evolve** with `azure-prepare`, `azure-validate`, `azure-deploy`, `azure-upgrade`, `azure-enterprise-infra-planner`, `azure-hosted-copilot-sdk`, `azure-kubernetes`, and `airunway-aks-setup`
- **Troubleshoot, monitor, and govern** with `azure-diagnostics`, `appinsights-instrumentation`, `azure-compliance`, `azure-resource-lookup`, and `azure-quotas`
- **Optimize architecture and cost** with `azure-cost`, `azure-compute`, `azure-resource-visualizer`, and `azure-cloud-migrate`
- **Work across data, AI, identity, and platform services** with `azure-ai`, `azure-aigateway`, `azure-storage`, `azure-kusto`, `azure-messaging`, `azure-rbac`, `entra-app-registration`, and `microsoft-foundry`

### Azure MCP Server: the hands

The plugin wires in the **Azure MCP Server**, which gives your agent **200+ structured tools across 40+ Azure services**. That is the execution layer for listing resources, checking prices, querying logs, diagnosing issues, and driving real Azure workflows.

### Foundry MCP: the AI specialist

The plugin also includes **Foundry MCP** for Microsoft Foundry scenarios such as model discovery, model deployment, and agent workflows.

## Why this plugin is different

This is not a prompt pack. It is a packaged Azure capability layer:

- **Skills** teach the agent when to use Azure workflows and what to avoid.
- **MCP tools** let the agent act on live Azure and Foundry resources.
- **The plugin** keeps the guidance layer and execution layer aligned in one install.
- **Multi-host support** lets you use the same Azure capability across environments such as GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and other compatible hosts.

## What you get

| Component | What it adds | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Azure skills** | Azure expertise, workflows, and guardrails | Prepare, validate, deploy, diagnostics, cost, AI, RBAC |
| **Azure MCP Server** | Live Azure tooling | Resource inventory, monitoring, pricing, storage, databases, messaging |
| **Foundry MCP** | Microsoft Foundry workflows | Model catalog, deployments, agents, evaluations |

The plugin payload lives in `.github/plugins/azure-skills/`, and the included MCP configuration shows how Azure and Foundry connectivity are wired for compatible hosts.

## Install in 60 seconds

### Prerequisites

Before you install, make sure you have:

- An Azure account or subscription
- **Node.js 18+** available on your PATH (`npx` is used to start the MCP servers)
- **Azure CLI** installed and authenticated with `az login`
- **Azure Developer CLI** installed and authenticated with `azd auth login` if you plan to use deployment workflows

### APM (one install, multiple harnesses)

The Azure Skills Plugin is multi-harness. If you use [APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm), one command installs it across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, and Gemini from a single `apm.yml`:

```bash
apm install microsoft/azure-skills
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

**Add the marketplace** (first time only):

```
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-skills
```

**Install the plugin**:

```
/plugin install azure@azure-skills
```

**Update the plugin**:

```
/plugin update azure@azure-skills
```

### VS Code

Install the **Azure MCP** extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace:

👉 [Azure MCP Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-mcp-server)

The Azure MCP extension will also install a companion extension that brings the Azure skills into VS Code. Together they configure the Azure MCP Server, Foundry MCP, and the full skills layer automatically.

> **Note:** The skills extension requires **Git CLI** to be installed on your machine. If you don't have it, ask Copilot to help you install Git for your OS.

### Claude Code

**Install the plugin** — either run:

```bash
/plugin install azure@claude-plugins-official
```

Or run `/plugin` and search for "azure" in the marketplace:

### IntelliJ IDEA

#### Prerequisites

Before installing Azure skills in IntelliJ IDEA, ensure you have:
- **Node.js 18+** installed on your system with `npx` available on your PATH
- **Git** installed and accessible from the command line

You can verify these prerequisites by running:
```bash
npx --version
git --version
```

#### Step 1: Install GitHub Copilot Plugin

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Go to **File** > **Settings** (on Windows/Linux) or **IntelliJ IDEA** > **Preferences** (on macOS)
3. Navigate to **Plugins** in the left sidebar
4. Search for "GitHub Copilot" in the Marketplace tab
5. Install the [GitHub Copilot plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot--your-ai-pair-programmer) (requires version 1.5.64-242 or higher)
6. Restart IntelliJ IDEA when prompted

#### Step 2: Enable Skills for GitHub Copilot

#### Step 3: Install Azure Skills

**Option 1: Install Azure Toolkit For IntelliJ Plugin**

1. **Install the Azure Toolkit plugin** from the JetBrains Marketplace:
   👉 [Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8053-azure-toolkit-for-intellij)
   
2. **Restart IntelliJ IDEA** to complete the plugin installation

3. **Install Azure Skills** when prompted:
   - After restarting, you'll see a notification offering to install Azure Skills
   - Click **Install** to add the Azure skills to your environment
   - See screenshot below for reference

   ![alt text](assets/intellij-install-skills-notification.png)

4. **Verify installation** by opening the GitHub Copilot chat window and typing:
   ```
   /skill:azure
   ```
   This will display all available Azure skills you can now use in your projects.

   ![alt text](assets/intellij-verify-azure-skills.png)


**Option 2:** Install Azure Skills manually

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Run the following command to install Azure skills globally for GitHub Copilot:

   ```bash
   npx skills add https://github.com/microsoft/azure-skills/tree/main/.github/plugins/azure-skills/skills -a github-copilot -g -y
   ```

   **Command explanation:**
   - `npx skills add` - Uses the skills CLI to add a new skills package
   - The GitHub URL points to the Azure skills directory in this repository
   - `-a github-copilot` - Specifies the skills are for GitHub Copilot
   - `-g` - Installs the skills globally (available across all projects)
   - `-y` - Automatically accepts prompts during installation

3. Wait for the installation to complete. You should see confirmation that the Azure skills have been successfully added.

## Sovereign Cloud Configuration

By default, the Azure MCP server connects to the Azure Public Cloud. If you use a sovereign cloud (Azure China Cloud or Azure US Government), you need to configure the MCP server to use the appropriate cloud environment.

### Copilot CLI

After installing the plugin, Azure MCP server should be configured for copilot as well. You can list the configured MCP servers by running `/mcp show`

![MCP Servers](assets/mcp_servers.png)

Edit the Azure MCP server named `azure` from `plugin:azure` to add the `--cloud` argument. Execute `/mcp edit azure`. Navigate to the `Command` section to add the `--cloud` argument, use `AzureChinaCloud` to access Azure China Cloud, and use `AzureUSGovernment` to access Azure US Government Cloud.

![Edit MCP Server](assets/edit_mcp_server.png)

Before starting the MCP server, ensure your local CLI tools are authenticated against the correct cloud:

| Cloud | Azure CLI | Azure PowerShell | Azure Developer CLI |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| China | `az cloud set --name AzureChinaCloud && az login` | `Connect-AzAccount -Environment AzureChinaCloud` | `azd config set cloud.name AzureChinaCloud && azd auth login` |
| US Government | `az cloud set --name AzureUSGovernment && az login` | `Connect-AzAccount -Environment AzureUSGovernment` | `azd config set cloud.name AzureUSGovernment && azd auth login` |

For more details, see [Connect to sovereign clouds](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/how-to/connect-sovereign-clouds) in the Azure MCP Server documentation.

## Verify the installation

After install, try three quick checks.

### 1. Verify the skills layer

Ask:

> What Azure services would I need to deploy this project?

You should get structured Azure guidance, not just a generic cloud answer.

### 2. Verify Azure MCP

Ask:

> List my Azure resource groups.

You should see a real tool-backed response from your Azure account.

### 3. Verify Foundry MCP

Ask:

> What AI models are available in Microsoft Foundry?

You should get a Foundry-backed response rather than a generic summary.

## Authentication

The recommended authentication path is Azure CLI:

```bash
az login
```

If you plan to deploy with `azd`, also run:

```bash
azd auth login
```

You can also authenticate with service principal credentials:

**Bash/Zsh**

```bash
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

**PowerShell**

```powershell
$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID = "your-tenant-id"
$env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id"
$env:AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET = "your-client-secret"
```

When the agent runs inside Azure, the Azure MCP Server can also use managed identity.

## Prompts to try

Once the plugin is installed, try prompts like these:

- `Prepare this app for Azure.`
- `Validate my Azure deployment files before I run azd up.`
- `Deploy this project to Azure Container Apps.`
- `List my Azure storage accounts.`
- `Find cost savings across my Azure subscription.`
- `Troubleshoot why my container app is failing health probes.`
- `What role should I assign to let this managed identity read blobs?`
- `What AI models are available in Microsoft Foundry?`

## Repository layout

If you are exploring or customizing the plugin source, the key pieces are:

- `.github/plugins/azure-skills/skills/` - the Azure skill definitions
- `.github/plugins/azure-skills/.mcp.json` - included MCP configuration for Azure and Foundry
- `landing-page/` - Astro GitHub Pages site source and maintenance guide
- `README.md` - high-level overview and install guide for the plugin

## Troubleshooting

### The agent is not using Azure skills

- Make sure the plugin installed successfully in your host
- Confirm the Azure skills directory is present
- Reload or restart your host so it re-indexes plugins and MCP configuration

### MCP tools are not showing up

- Verify Node.js is installed and `npx` works
- Check that the Azure and Foundry MCP entries were added for your host
- Restart MCP servers or reload the host after configuration changes

### Azure commands fail with auth errors

- Re-run `az login`
- Re-run `azd auth login` for deployment scenarios
- Make sure the correct Azure subscription is selected
