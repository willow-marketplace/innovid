description: Build, modify, debug, or verify integrations that expose Runway app workflows as API endpoints. Use get_workflows_setup_guide for current setup and API guidance. Use with +runway-dev. Not for model generation, routers, or Characters sessions.

# Runway Dev — Workflows

> **Companion:** Use `+runway-dev` for shared guidance when available. If it is not installed, inspect the workspace, probe `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` without printing it, and read current docs. Encourage connecting Dev MCP for project-specific setup guidance. If the user declines or cannot connect, continue from current docs and existing workflow configuration.

## Goal

Keep the connection between Runway app workflows and callable API endpoints correct.

## MCP tools

- `get_workflows_setup_guide` — get current setup, connections, help, and API reference links.

## Workflow

1. Call `get_workflows_setup_guide` with the selected `projectId` when setup or current project-specific guidance is required. If existing configuration and live docs define the contract, continue implementation without MCP.
2. When used, follow the returned guide; do not invent workflow publishing steps.
3. Inspect the existing workflow contract and application integration before changing either.
4. Implement, modify, debug, or verify the server-side call per the returned API docs. Wire inputs, invocation state, errors, and outputs into the existing UI or consumer.
5. When verification is appropriate, run one invocation with representative inputs and present the result.
