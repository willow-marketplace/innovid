## Overview

Help the user create one or more deal records in the Carta CRM. First fetch available
pipelines and custom fields, then collect deal details conversationally, then call
`create_deal`.

## Step 1 — Fetch available pipelines and stages

Call the pipelines tool so the user can pick a pipeline and stage by name:

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_deal_pipelines_with_stages()
```

Present the pipeline and stage names to the user. If the call fails, proceed without
it — pipeline and stage default to the organization's defaults if omitted.

## Step 2 — Discover available custom fields (optional)

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_deal_custom_fields()
```

Use returned field IDs and labels as hints when collecting deal data.
If the call fails, proceed without it.

## Step 3 — Collect deal information

Ask the user for:
- **Pipeline** (optional) — which pipeline this deal belongs to (from Step 1)
- **Stage** (optional) — which stage within the pipeline (from Step 1)
- **Company name** (optional) — the company associated with the deal
- **Company URL** (optional) — company website (used for auto-enrichment)
- **Comment** (optional) — notes or comments about the deal
- **Tags** (optional) — array of tag strings
- **Deal lead** (optional) — user ID to assign as deal lead
- **Added at** (optional) — ISO 8601 date the deal was added
- **People** (optional) — contact IDs for advisers, introducers, management
- **Custom fields** (optional) — any fields returned in Step 2

If the user has already provided details in their message, extract them directly
without re-asking.

## Step 4 — Create the deal

Call:

```
mcp__carta_crm__create_deal({
  pipelineId: "<pipeline id>",
  stageId: "<stage id>",
  company: {
    name: "<company name>",
    url: "<company url>"
  },
  comment: "<comment>",
  tags: ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
  dealLead: "<user id>",
  addedAt: "<ISO 8601 date>",
  people: {
    advisers: ["<contact id>"],
    introducer: ["<contact id>"],
    management: ["<contact id>"]
  },
  fields: {
    "<field_id>": "<value>"
  }
})
```

Omit any key the user did not provide. Omit `company` if neither name nor URL was given.

## Step 5 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Deal for **{company name}** created successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Verify pipeline and stage IDs — run `get_deal_pipelines_with_stages` to list valid options
- Check that custom field IDs are valid

## Adding multiple deals

If the user wants to add multiple deals at once, repeat Steps 3–5 for each one.
After all are done, summarize:
> "Created N deals: [list of company names with IDs]"
