## Overview

Search for deals in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch that deal
directly. Otherwise use `search_deals` with filters. Always surface the deal ID
so the user can reference it for updates.

**Important:** Call `get_deal_fields` before every `search_deals` call to discover
valid field IDs for filters. Do not skip this step.

## Step 1 — Fetch deal fields

Always call this before searching:

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_deal_fields()
```

Read the field IDs, types, and descriptions carefully. Map the user's intent to the
most specific matching field(s) and use those in the `filters` parameter.

## Step 2 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided a deal ID → call `fetch_deal_by_deal_id`
- **By filters / keyword** — user provided a company name, stage, or criteria → call `search_deals`

## Step 3 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__fetch_deal_by_deal_id({ id: "<deal id>" })
```

**By filters:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__search_deals({
  query: "<free-text search — last resort only>",
  stages: ["<stage id>"],
  filters: [
    { field_id: "<field id>", operator: "eq", value: "<value>" }
  ],
  limit: 50
})
```

Prefer `filters` over `query` whenever a specific field matches the user's intent.
Available operators: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `contains`, `in`, `between`.
Use `stages` to filter by pipeline stage (funnel, tracking, due-diligence, execution, dead, completed).

Increase `limit` or use `offset` to paginate if `remainingCount > 0`.

## Step 4 — Present results

For each deal returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
`fetch_deal_by_deal_id` returns full detail including all notes and linked people — surface those if relevant.
Always show the deal ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-deal`.

If no deals are found:
> "No deals found matching your search. Try a different company name or adjust the filters."

Note the total count and offer to paginate if there are more results.
