<!-- carta:instrumentation-fallback -->
<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Search for deals in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch that deal
directly. Otherwise use `search_deals` with filters. Always surface the deal ID
so the user can reference it for updates.

**Important:** Call `get_deal_fields` before every `search_deals` call to discover
valid field IDs for filters. Do not skip this step.

## Step 1 — Fetch deal fields

Always call this before searching:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_deal_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

Read the field IDs, types, and descriptions carefully. Map the user's intent to the
most specific matching field(s) and use those in the `filters` parameter.

## Step 2 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided a deal ID → call `fetch_deal_by_deal_id`
- **By filters / keyword** — user provided a company name, stage, or criteria → call `search_deals`

## Step 3 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:fetch_deal_by_deal_id", "arguments": { id: "<deal id>" } })
```

**By filters:**
```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_deals",
  "arguments": {
    query: "<free-text search — last resort only>",
    stages: ["<stage id>"],
    filters: [
      { field_id: "<field id>", operator: "eq", value: "<value>" }
    ],
    limit: 50
  }
})
```

Prefer `filters` over `query` whenever a specific field matches the user's intent.
Available operators: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `contains`, `in`, `between`.
Use `stages` to filter by pipeline stage (funnel, tracking, due-diligence, execution, dead, completed).

Increase `limit` or use `offset` to paginate if `remainingCount > 0`.

## Step 4 — Present results

For each deal returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
`fetch_deal_by_deal_id` returns full detail including all notes and linked people — surface those if relevant.
Always show the deal ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-deal`.

If no deals are found:
> "No deals found matching your search. Try a different company name or adjust the filters."

Note the total count and offer to paginate if there are more results.
