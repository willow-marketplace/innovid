<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Search for companies in the Carta CRM. Choose the right tool based on what the user
provided. Always surface the company ID so the user can reference it for updates.

## Step 1 — Determine search mode

- **By domain** — user provided a website domain (e.g. "stripe.com") → use `fetch_company_by_domain`
- **By name / keyword** — user provided a company name or keyword → use `search_companies`

If it's unclear, default to search by name and ask for a search term.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

**By domain:**
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:fetch_company_by_domain", "arguments": { domain: "<domain>" } })
```

**By name / keyword:**
```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_companies",
  "arguments": {
    query: "<search term>",
    limit: 20
  }
})
```

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each company returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
Always show the ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-company`.

If no companies are found:
> "No companies found matching your search. Try a different name, keyword, or domain."

If multiple results are returned, list them all and note the total count.
