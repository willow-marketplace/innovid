name: add-contact
description: Adds one or more contact records to the Carta CRM via the Carta CRM MCP Server. Use this skill when the user says things like "add a contact", "create a contact record", "add contact to CRM", "save a contact", "upload contact to Carta CRM", or "/add-contact". Collects contact information conversationally, then creates it via the MCP server. Only name is required — all other fields are optional.

<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Help the user create one or more contact records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_contact` MCP tool. Only `name` is required — collect that and any other
details the user has already provided, then call the tool. Do not block on optional fields.

## Step 1 — Collect contact information

Only `name` is required. Extract everything the user has already provided in their
message without re-asking. If `name` is missing, ask for it once.

Fields you can collect:
- **name** (required) — full name, or derived from firstName + lastName
- **firstName**, **lastName**, **middleName** (optional)
- **emailDetail** — primary email; emailDetailSecond/Third/Fourth for additional emails
- **phone** — primary phone; businessPhone/thirdPhone/fourthPhone for additional numbers
- **title** — job title
- **headline** — short bio or tagline
- **location** — work location: city, state, country
- **socialLinks** — linkedinUrl, twitterUrl, githubUrl, facebookUrl
- **jobs** — work experience: array of {companyName, title, startedOn, endedOn}
- **tags** — array of string tags
- **notes** — free-text notes
- **listId** — if provided, adds the contact to that list

If the user wants to populate custom fields, fetch the schema first:
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_contact_custom_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

Never ask for `listId` unless the user brings it up.

## Step 2 — Create the contact

Call:

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:create_contact",
  "arguments": {
    name: "<contact name>",
    firstName: "<first>",
    lastName: "<last>",
    emailDetail: "<email>",
    phone: "<phone>",
    title: "<title>",
    tags: ["<tag1>"],
    fields: { "<field_id>": "<value>" }
  }
})
```

Include only the fields the user provided. Omit everything else.

## Step 3 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Contact **{name}** saved successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify the `listId` exists if one was provided

## Adding multiple contacts

If the user wants to add multiple contacts, repeat Steps 1–3 for each one, then
summarize:
> "Created N contacts: [list of names with IDs]"
