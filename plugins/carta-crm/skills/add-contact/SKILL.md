## Overview

Help the user create one or more contact records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_contact` MCP tool. Only `name` is required — collect that and any other
details the user has already provided, then call the tool. Do not block on optional fields.

## Step 1 — Collect contact information

Only `name` is required. Extract everything the user has already provided in their
message without re-asking. If `name` is missing, ask for it once.

Fields you can collect:
- **name** (required) — full name, or derived from firstName + lastName
- **firstName**, **lastName**, **middleName** (optional)
- **emailDetail** — primary email; emailDetailSecond/Third/Fourth for additional emails
- **phone** — primary phone; businessPhone/thirdPhone/fourthPhone for additional numbers
- **title** — job title
- **headline** — short bio or tagline
- **location** — work location: city, state, country
- **socialLinks** — linkedinUrl, twitterUrl, githubUrl, facebookUrl
- **jobs** — work experience: array of {companyName, title, startedOn, endedOn}
- **tags** — array of string tags
- **notes** — free-text notes
- **listId** — if provided, adds the contact to that list

If the user wants to populate custom fields, fetch the schema first:
```
mcp__carta_crm__get_contact_custom_fields()
```

Never ask for `listId` unless the user brings it up.

## Step 2 — Create the contact

Call:

```
mcp__carta_crm__create_contact({
  name: "<contact name>",
  firstName: "<first>",
  lastName: "<last>",
  emailDetail: "<email>",
  phone: "<phone>",
  title: "<title>",
  tags: ["<tag1>"],
  fields: { "<field_id>": "<value>" }
})
```

Include only the fields the user provided. Omit everything else.

## Step 3 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Contact **{name}** saved successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify the `listId` exists if one was provided

## Adding multiple contacts

If the user wants to add multiple contacts, repeat Steps 1–3 for each one, then
summarize:
> "Created N contacts: [list of names with IDs]"
