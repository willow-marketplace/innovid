## Overview

Enrich a company profile by fetching its website and extracting key business information.
The result is returned as structured JSON and saved locally for auditing.

## Step 1 — Normalize the target URL

Take the `target` input and produce a clean `https://` URL:
- If it already starts with `http://` or `https://`, use it as-is.
- If it looks like a bare domain (e.g., `acme.com`), prepend `https://`.
- Strip any trailing paths — use only the root URL (e.g., `https://acme.com`).

Also extract the bare domain (e.g., `acme.com`) — you'll need it for the output filename.

## Step 2 — Fetch the company website

Use WebFetch to retrieve the homepage. Look for:
- Page `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` content
- `<h1>` / `<h2>` headings and hero/tagline text
- Any "About", "What we do", or "Our mission" sections

If the homepage returns insufficient content (e.g., a login wall, placeholder, or very sparse text),
also try fetching `[root-url]/about` as a fallback.

## Step 3 — Supplement with web search if needed

If the website alone doesn't clearly reveal the company's industry or what it does,
run a WebSearch for:

```
"[company name]" company what does it do
```

Use the top 2–3 results to fill in gaps — especially for `industry` and `description`.

## Step 4 — Extract structured data

From the gathered content, produce the following fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `name` | string | Official company name (not the domain) |
| `industry` | string | Primary industry, e.g. "FinTech", "SaaS", "Healthcare IT", "Climate Tech" |
| `tags` | array of strings | 3–6 short topic tags, e.g. `["payments", "B2B", "API", "embedded finance"]` |
| `description` | string | 1–2 sentence plain-English summary of what the company does |
| `website` | string | Canonical root URL, e.g. `https://acme.com` |

Use specific, meaningful tags — avoid generic ones like "technology" or "software" on their own.

## Step 5 — Save the enrichment record

Write the JSON to a local audit file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.carta-crm/enriched-companies
cat > ~/.carta-crm/enriched-companies/[domain].json << 'ENDJSON'
{
  "name": "...",
  "industry": "...",
  "tags": [...],
  "description": "...",
  "website": "..."
}
ENDJSON
```

Replace `[domain]` with the bare domain (e.g., `acme.com`).
Confirm the file was written with `echo $?` (should be 0).

## Step 6 — Return the result

Return the enrichment record as a JSON block, followed by the save path:

```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "industry": "...",
  "tags": [...],
  "description": "...",
  "website": "..."
}
```

State: `Saved to ~/.carta-crm/enriched-companies/[domain].json`

## Handling multiple companies

If the user provides multiple targets, repeat Steps 1–5 for each one, then return all
results together and summarize: `Enriched N companies — saved to ~/.carta-crm/enriched-companies/`
