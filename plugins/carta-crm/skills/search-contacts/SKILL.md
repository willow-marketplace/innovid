## Overview

Search for contacts in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch the single
record directly. Otherwise search by name/keyword and return results in a readable
summary. Always surface the contact ID so the user can reference it for updates.

## Step 1 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided a contact ID → call `fetch_contact_by_id`
- **By name / keyword** — user provided a name, email, or keyword → call `search_contacts`

If it's unclear, default to search and ask the user for a search term.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__fetch_contact_by_id({ id: "<contact id>" })
```

**By name / keyword:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__search_contacts({
  query: "<search term>",
  limit: 20
})
```

If the user mentions a specific list or folder by name, call `get_contact_lists` first
to resolve the name to a list ID, then pass `list_id` to narrow the search.

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each contact returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary,
including name, title, company, email, phone, and tags.
Always show the ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-contact`.

`fetch_contact_by_id` also returns related deals and notes — surface those if the
user is looking for context on a specific person.

If no contacts are found:
> "No contacts found matching your search. Try a different name, email, or keyword."

If multiple results are returned, list them all and note the total count.
