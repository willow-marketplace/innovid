name: update-fundraising
description: Updates an existing fundraising record in the Carta CRM. Use this skill when the user says things like "update a fundraising", "edit fundraising", "update fundraising details", "change fundraising stage", "update fundraising fields", or "/update-fundraising". Accepts a fundraising ID or name (will search if no ID provided). Only the fields explicitly provided are changed — all other fields are left untouched.

<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Partially update an existing fundraising. Only fields provided are modified — this is
a partial update, not a replacement. First resolve the fundraising ID, collect what to
change, then call the update tool.

## Step 1 — Resolve the fundraising ID

If the user provided a fundraising ID directly, use it and skip to Step 3.

If only a name or keyword was given, search first:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:search_fundraising", "arguments": { query: "<name>", limit: 10 } })
```

If multiple fundraisings match, present the list and ask the user to confirm which one
to update (show name and ID for each).

## Step 2 — Collect what to update

Ask the user what they want to change:
- **name** — fundraising round name
- **stageId** — move to a different stage (call `get_fundraising_stages` to resolve name → ID)
- **fields** — custom field values keyed by field ID

If the user wants to move to a stage by name, fetch the stages to resolve name → ID:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising_stages", "arguments": {} })
```

If the user wants to update custom fields but isn't sure of field IDs, fetch the schema first:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising_custom_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

**Important:** Only include fields that are explicitly being changed. Omit everything else.

## Step 3 — Update the fundraising

Call:

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:update_fundraising",
  "arguments": {
    id: "<fundraising id>",
    name: "<updated name>",
    stageId: "<stage id>",
    fields: {
      "<field_id>": "<value>"
    }
  }
})
```

Omit any key that is not being updated.

## Step 4 — Report result

On success, respond with a summary of what changed:
> "Fundraising **{name}** updated (ID: `{id}`). Changed: [list of changed fields]"

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Verify the fundraising ID is correct — run `/search-fundraisings` to find it
- Check that stage IDs are valid — run `get_fundraising_stages` to list options
- Check that custom field IDs are valid

## Updating multiple fundraisings

If the user wants to apply the same change to multiple fundraisings, repeat Steps 1 and 3–4
for each. Summarize at the end:
> "Updated N fundraisings: [list of names]"
