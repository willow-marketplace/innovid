## Overview

Partially update an existing fundraising. Only fields provided are modified — this is
a partial update, not a replacement. First resolve the fundraising ID, collect what to
change, then call the update tool.

## Step 1 — Resolve the fundraising ID

If the user provided a fundraising ID directly, use it and skip to Step 3.

If only a name or keyword was given, search first:

```
mcp__carta_crm__search_fundraising({ query: "<name>", limit: 10 })
```

If multiple fundraisings match, present the list and ask the user to confirm which one
to update (show name and ID for each).

## Step 2 — Collect what to update

Ask the user what they want to change:
- **name** — fundraising round name
- **stageId** — move to a different stage (call `get_fundraising_stages` to resolve name → ID)
- **fields** — custom field values keyed by field ID

If the user wants to update custom fields but isn't sure of field IDs, fetch the schema first:

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_fundraising_custom_fields()
```

**Important:** Only include fields that are explicitly being changed. Omit everything else.

## Step 3 — Update the fundraising

Call:

```
mcp__carta_crm__update_fundraising({
  id: "<fundraising id>",
  name: "<updated name>",
  stageId: "<stage id>",
  fields: {
    "<field_id>": "<value>"
  }
})
```

Omit any key that is not being updated.

## Step 4 — Report result

On success, respond with a summary of what changed:
> "Fundraising **{name}** updated (ID: `{id}`). Changed: [list of changed fields]"

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Verify the fundraising ID is correct — run `/search-fundraisings` to find it
- Check that stage IDs are valid — run `get_fundraising_stages` to list options
- Check that custom field IDs are valid

## Updating multiple fundraisings

If the user wants to apply the same change to multiple fundraisings, repeat Steps 1 and 3–4
for each. Summarize at the end:
> "Updated N fundraisings: [list of names]"
