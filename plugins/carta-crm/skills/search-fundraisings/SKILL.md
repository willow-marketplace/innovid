name: search-fundraisings
description: Searches for and retrieves fundraising records from the Carta CRM. Use this skill when the user says things like "find a fundraising", "search fundraisings", "look up a fundraising round", "show fundraising details for [name]", "full details on [name]", "get fundraising by ID", "list fundraisings", "what fundraisings do we have", or "/search-fundraisings". Returns fundraising details including ID, name, stage, and custom fields. The fundraising ID returned can be used with the update-fundraising skill.

<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Look up fundraisings in the Carta CRM. A request about **one named round** renders that
round's card; a request for a **set** renders a table. Route on that distinction first —
it decides every call below.

## Step 1 — Determine intent: one round, or a set?

- **Detail** — the user named one round and wants the record: "full details on the Acme
  Series B", "tell me about that round", "more on this fundraising". → Step 2.
- **List** — the user wants a set, or filtered or plural results: "rounds in diligence",
  "list fundraisings", "what fundraisings do we have". → Step 3.
- **By ID** — the user gave a fundraising ID → Step 2, skipping the resolve.

A named single round is a **detail** request even when the user says "search" or "find".
If it's genuinely unclear, treat it as a list and ask what they want to narrow to.

## Step 2 — Detail: resolve the name, then render the card

**Resolve through `crm_call_tool`, never `crm_view_tool`.** This step is for you, not the
user: a view call collapses every array in the response to a count, so the rows — and the
`id` you need — never reach you, and the user gets a list they did not ask for.

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_fundraising",
  "arguments": { query: "<round name>", limit: 10 }
})
```

Then branch on how many candidates came back:

- **Exactly one match** → render its card and stop:
  ```
  crm_view_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising", "arguments": { id: "<id>" } })
  ```
- **Several matches** → do NOT guess. Render the candidates as a view and ask which one:
  ```
  crm_view_tool({
    "name": "crm:search_fundraising",
    "arguments": { query: "<round name>", limit: 10 }
  })
  ```
  Then ask: "Several fundraisings match — which one did you mean?" When they pick, call
  `get_fundraising` for it. One company often has several rounds, so opening the top hit
  unasked shows the wrong round with full confidence.
- **No match** → say so; do not render an empty view.

When the user gives an ID outright, there is nothing to resolve — one call, one card.

Render at most one card per request. If the user named several rounds, ask which to open
rather than stacking views.

## Step 3 — List: search and render the table

```
crm_view_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_fundraising",
  "arguments": {
    query: "<search term>",
    limit: 20
  }
})
```

If the user filtered by stage name, resolve the name to a stage ID first, then pass
`stages: ["<stage id>"]`. This lookup has no view of its own, so it goes through
`crm_call_tool`:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising_stages", "arguments": {} })
```

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

### If the view is unavailable

CRM views are enabled per organisation, and single-record views behind a second flag on
top of that. So any `crm_view_tool` call above may answer with:

> CRM tool 'search_fundraising' has no view — call it with crm_call_tool instead.

That is a normal response, not a failure — this organisation does not have that view
enabled. Retry that one call verbatim through `crm_call_tool` and present the result as
text per Step 4. Do **not** retry `crm_view_tool`, and do not report the message to the
user.

A detail request whose card has no view still resolves the same way: keep the
`crm_call_tool` resolve from Step 2 and present the chosen record as text.

## Step 4 — Present results

**When a card rendered**, the user sees the whole record. Do not restate its fields.
Answer what they asked, or acknowledge in one line.

**When a table rendered**, the user already sees every row. Do NOT re-list, re-format, or
summarise them as text — that duplicates the table. Answer the question they actually
asked, or acknowledge in one line (e.g. "6 fundraisings match — the ID is in the first
column, for `/update-fundraising`.").

**When you fell back to `crm_call_tool`**, display all non-empty fields in a readable
summary and show the ID prominently — the user needs it to run `/update-fundraising`.

If no fundraisings are found:
> "No fundraisings found matching your search. Try a different name or keyword."
