Returns fundraising details including ID, name, stage, and custom fields. The fundraising ID returned can be used with the update-fundraising skill.

<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Search for fundraisings in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch the single
record directly. Otherwise use the search tool and return results in a readable summary.
Always surface the fundraising ID so the user can reference it for updates.

## Step 1 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided a fundraising ID → call `get_fundraising`
- **By name / keyword / stage** — user provided a name or stage → call `search_fundraising`

If it's unclear, default to search and ask for a search term.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising", "arguments": { id: "<fundraising id>" } })
```

**By name / keyword:**
```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_fundraising",
  "arguments": {
    query: "<search term>",
    limit: 20
  }
})
```

If the user filtered by stage name, call `get_fundraising_stages` first to resolve
the name to a stage ID, then pass `stages: ["<stage id>"]`:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising_stages", "arguments": {} })
```

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each fundraising returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
Always show the ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-fundraising`.

If no fundraisings are found:
> "No fundraisings found matching your search. Try a different name or keyword."

Note the total count and offer to paginate if there are more results.
