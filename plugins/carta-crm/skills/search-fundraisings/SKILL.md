## Overview

Search for fundraisings in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch the single
record directly. Otherwise use the search tool and return results in a readable summary.
Always surface the fundraising ID so the user can reference it for updates.

## Step 1 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided a fundraising ID → call `get_fundraising`
- **By name / keyword / stage** — user provided a name or stage → call `search_fundraising`

If it's unclear, default to search and ask for a search term.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__get_fundraising({ id: "<fundraising id>" })
```

**By name / keyword:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__search_fundraising({
  query: "<search term>",
  limit: 20
})
```

If the user filtered by stage name, call `get_fundraising_stages` first to resolve
the name to a stage ID, then pass `stages: ["<stage id>"]`.

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each fundraising returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
Always show the ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-fundraising`.

If no fundraisings are found:
> "No fundraisings found matching your search. Try a different name or keyword."

Note the total count and offer to paginate if there are more results.
