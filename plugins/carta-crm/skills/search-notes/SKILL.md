<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Search for notes in the Carta CRM by keyword using `search_notes`.
Return results in a readable summary.

## Step 1 — Collect the search term

If the user provided a keyword or topic, use it directly.
If no search term was given, ask for one.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_notes",
  "arguments": {
    query: "<search term>",
    limit: 20
  }
})
```

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate
when `remainingCount > 0`.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each note returned, display:
- Title
- Text content (truncated to ~200 chars if long)
- Creation date and owner if available

If no notes are found:
> "No notes found matching your search. Try a different keyword."

Note the total count and offer to paginate if there are more results.
