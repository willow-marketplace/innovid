## Overview

Help the user create one or more investor records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_investor` MCP tool. Collect investor details conversationally, validate
required fields, then call the tool.

## Step 1 — Discover available custom fields (optional but recommended)

Call the custom fields tool to see what fields the tenant has configured:

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_investor_custom_fields()
```

Use the returned field IDs and labels as hints when collecting investor data.
If the call fails, proceed without it — custom fields are optional.

## Step 2 — Collect investor information

Ask the user for:
- **Name** (required) — the investor firm name (e.g. "Sequoia Capital", "a16z")
- **Custom fields** (optional) — any fields returned in Step 1 (e.g. website, location, industry, about, tags)

If the user has already provided details in their message, extract them directly
without re-asking.

## Step 3 — Create the investor

Call:

```
mcp__carta_crm__create_investor({
  name: "<investor name>",
  fields: {
    "<field_id>": "<value>"
  }
})
```

Omit `fields` entirely if no custom field data was provided.

## Step 4 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Investor **{name}** created successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify custom field IDs match the keys returned by `get_investor_custom_fields`

## Adding multiple investors

If the user wants to add multiple investors at once, repeat Steps 2–4 for each one.
After all are done, summarize:
> "Created N investors: [list of names with IDs]"
