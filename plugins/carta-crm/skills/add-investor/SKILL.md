<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Help the user create one or more investor records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_investor` MCP tool. Collect investor details conversationally, validate
required fields, then call the tool.

## Step 1 — Discover available custom fields (optional but recommended)

Call the custom fields tool to see what fields the tenant has configured:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_investor_custom_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

Use the returned field IDs and labels as hints when collecting investor data.
If the call fails, proceed without it — custom fields are optional.

## Step 2 — Collect investor information

Ask the user for:
- **Name** (required) — the investor firm name (e.g. "Sequoia Capital", "a16z")
- **Custom fields** (optional) — any fields returned in Step 1 (e.g. website, location, industry, about, tags)

If the user has already provided details in their message, extract them directly
without re-asking.

## Step 3 — Create the investor

Call:

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:create_investor",
  "arguments": {
    name: "<investor name>",
    fields: {
      "<field_id>": "<value>"
    }
  }
})
```

Omit `fields` entirely if no custom field data was provided.

## Step 4 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Investor **{name}** created successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify custom field IDs match the keys returned by `get_investor_custom_fields`

## Adding multiple investors

If the user wants to add multiple investors at once, repeat Steps 2–4 for each one.
After all are done, summarize:
> "Created N investors: [list of names with IDs]"
