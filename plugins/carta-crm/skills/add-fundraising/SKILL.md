## Overview

Help the user create one or more fundraising records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_fundraising` MCP tool. Collect details conversationally, then call the tool.

## Step 1 — Fetch available stages (optional but recommended)

Call the stages tool so the user can pick a stage by name:

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_fundraising_stages()
```

Present the stage names to the user. If the call fails, proceed without it —
stage defaults to the first stage if omitted.

## Step 2 — Discover available custom fields (optional)

```
mcp__carta_crm__get_fundraising_custom_fields()
```

Use returned field IDs and labels as hints when collecting fundraising data.
If the call fails, proceed without it.

## Step 3 — Collect fundraising information

Ask the user for:
- **Name** (required) — the fundraising round name (e.g. "Acme Corp Series B", "Project Atlas Seed Round")
- **Stage** (optional) — which stage this fundraising is in (from Step 1)
- **Custom fields** (optional) — any fields returned in Step 2

If the user has already provided details in their message, extract them directly
without re-asking.

## Step 4 — Create the fundraising

Call:

```
mcp__carta_crm__create_fundraising({
  name: "<fundraising name>",
  stageId: "<stage id>",
  fields: {
    "<field_id>": "<value>"
  }
})
```

Omit `stageId` and `fields` if not provided.

## Step 5 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Fundraising **{name}** created successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify stage IDs are valid — run `get_fundraising_stages` to list options
- Verify custom field IDs match the keys returned by `get_fundraising_custom_fields`

## Adding multiple fundraisings

If the user wants to add multiple fundraisings at once, repeat Steps 3–5 for each one.
After all are done, summarize:
> "Created N fundraisings: [list of names with IDs]"
