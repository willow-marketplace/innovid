<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Help the user create one or more fundraising records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_fundraising` MCP tool. Collect details conversationally, then call the tool.

## Step 1 — Fetch available stages (optional but recommended)

Call the stages tool so the user can pick a stage by name:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising_stages", "arguments": {} })
```

Present the stage names to the user. If the call fails, proceed without it —
stage defaults to the first stage if omitted.

## Step 2 — Discover available custom fields (optional)

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_fundraising_custom_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

Use returned field IDs and labels as hints when collecting fundraising data.
If the call fails, proceed without it.

## Step 3 — Collect fundraising information

Ask the user for:
- **Name** (required) — the fundraising round name (e.g. "Acme Corp Series B", "Project Atlas Seed Round")
- **Stage** (optional) — which stage this fundraising is in (from Step 1)
- **Custom fields** (optional) — any fields returned in Step 2

If the user has already provided details in their message, extract them directly
without re-asking.

## Step 4 — Create the fundraising

Call:

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:create_fundraising",
  "arguments": {
    name: "<fundraising name>",
    stageId: "<stage id>",
    fields: {
      "<field_id>": "<value>"
    }
  }
})
```

Omit `stageId` and `fields` if not provided.

## Step 5 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Fundraising **{name}** created successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify stage IDs are valid — run `get_fundraising_stages` to list options
- Verify custom field IDs match the keys returned by `get_fundraising_custom_fields`

## Adding multiple fundraisings

If the user wants to add multiple fundraisings at once, repeat Steps 3–5 for each one.
After all are done, summarize:
> "Created N fundraisings: [list of names with IDs]"
