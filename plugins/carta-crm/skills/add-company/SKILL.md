<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>", "surface": "<value>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.
`surface` is the Claude surface you are running in: `"chat"` (claude.ai or the Claude app, i.e. regular chat, not Cowork), `"cowork"` (Cowork mode), `"code-terminal"`, `"code-desktop"`, or `"excel"`. Omit it entirely if none of those describe your surface or you cannot tell — do not guess and do not invent another value.

## Overview

Help the user create one or more company records in the Carta CRM using the
`create_company` MCP tool. Collect company details conversationally, validate
required fields, then call the tool.

## Step 1 — Discover available custom fields (optional but recommended)

Call the custom fields tool to see what fields the tenant has configured:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_company_custom_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

Use the returned field IDs and labels as hints when collecting company data.
If the call fails, proceed without it — custom fields are optional.

## Step 2 — Collect company information

Ask the user for:
- **Name** (required) — the company name (e.g. "Stripe", "Acme Corp")
- **Image URL** (optional) — company logo URL
- **Custom fields** (optional) — any fields returned in Step 1 (e.g. website, industry, location, about, tags)

If the user has already provided details in their message, extract them directly
without re-asking.

## Step 3 — Create the company

Call:

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:create_company",
  "arguments": {
    name: "<company name>",
    image: "<logo url>",
    fields: {
      "<field_id>": "<value>"
    }
  }
})
```

Omit `image` and `fields` if not provided.

## Step 4 — Report result

On success, respond with:
> "Company **{name}** created successfully (ID: `{id}`)."

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Check that `name` is provided and non-empty
- Verify custom field IDs match the keys returned by `get_company_custom_fields`

## Adding multiple companies

If the user wants to add multiple companies at once, repeat Steps 2–4 for each one.
After all are done, summarize:
> "Created N companies: [list of names with IDs]"
