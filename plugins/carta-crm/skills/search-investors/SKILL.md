## Overview

Search for investors in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch the single
record directly. Otherwise use the search tool and return results in a readable summary.
Always surface the investor ID so the user can reference it for updates.

## Step 1 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided an investor ID → call `get_investor`
- **By name / keyword** — user provided a name or description → call `search_investors`

If it's unclear, default to search and ask the user for a name or keyword.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__get_investor({ id: "<investor id>" })
```

**By name / keyword:**
```
mcp__carta_crm__search_investors({
  query: "<search term>",
  limit: 20
})
```

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each investor returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
Always show the ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-investor`.

If no investors are found:
> "No investors found matching your search. Try a different name or keyword."

If multiple results are returned, list them all and note the total count.
