<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Search for investors in the Carta CRM. If the user provided an ID, fetch the single
record directly. Otherwise use the search tool and return results in a readable summary.
Always surface the investor ID so the user can reference it for updates.

## Step 1 — Determine search mode

- **By ID** — user provided an investor ID → call `get_investor`
- **By name / keyword** — user provided a name or description → call `search_investors`

If it's unclear, default to search and ask the user for a name or keyword.

## Step 2 — Execute the search

**By ID:**
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_investor", "arguments": { id: "<investor id>" } })
```

**By name / keyword:**
```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:search_investors",
  "arguments": {
    query: "<search term>",
    limit: 20
  }
})
```

Increase `limit` if the user asks to see more results. Use `offset` to paginate.

## Step 3 — Present results

For each investor returned, display all non-empty fields in a readable summary.
Always show the ID prominently — the user will need it to run `/update-investor`.

If no investors are found:
> "No investors found matching your search. Try a different name or keyword."

If multiple results are returned, list them all and note the total count.
