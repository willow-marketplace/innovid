name: update-deal
description: Updates an existing deal record in the Carta CRM. Use this skill when the user says things like "update a deal", "move deal to [stage]", "change deal stage", "edit deal", "update deal fields", "add a tag to deal", "assign deal lead", "update company info on deal", "link contacts to deal", or "/update-deal". Accepts a deal ID or company name (will search if no ID provided). Only the fields explicitly provided are changed — all other fields are left untouched.

<!-- carta:instrumentation-fallback -->
<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

## Overview

Partially update an existing deal. Only fields provided are modified — this is
a partial update, not a replacement. First resolve the deal ID, collect what to
change, then call the update tool.

## Step 1 — Resolve the deal ID

If the user provided a deal ID directly, use it and skip to Step 3.

If only a company name was given, call `get_deal_fields` first, then search:

```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_deal_fields", "arguments": {} })
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:search_deals", "arguments": { query: "<company name>", limit: 10 } })
```

If multiple deals match, present the list and ask the user to confirm which one
to update (show company name, stage, and ID for each).

## Step 2 — Collect what to update

Ask the user what they want to change:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `stageId` | Move deal to a different stage |
| `company.name` | Update the associated company name |
| `company.url` | Update company URL — triggers auto-enrichment |
| `comment` | Replace the deal comment/notes |
| `tags` | Replace the full tags array |
| `dealLead` | User ID to assign as deal lead |
| `addedAt` | ISO 8601 date the deal was added |
| `fields` | Custom field values keyed by field ID |
| `people.advisers` | Contact IDs linked as advisers |
| `people.introducer` | Contact IDs linked as introducers |
| `people.management` | Contact IDs linked as management |

If the user wants to move to a stage by name, fetch pipelines first:
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_deal_pipelines_with_stages", "arguments": {} })
```

If updating custom fields by label rather than ID:
```
crm_call_tool({ "name": "crm:get_deal_custom_fields", "arguments": {} })
```

**Important:** Only include fields that are explicitly being changed. Omit everything else.

## Step 3 — Update the deal

Call:

```
crm_call_tool({
  "name": "crm:update_deal",
  "arguments": {
    id: "<deal id>",
    stageId: "<stage id>",
    company: { name: "<name>", url: "<url>" },
    comment: "<updated comment>",
    tags: ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
    dealLead: "<user id>",
    addedAt: "<ISO 8601 date>",
    fields: { "<field_id>": "<value>" },
    people: {
      advisers: ["<contact id>"],
      introducer: ["<contact id>"],
      management: ["<contact id>"]
    }
  }
})
```

Omit any top-level key that is not being updated.

## Step 4 — Report result

On success, respond with a summary of what changed:
> "Deal for **{company name}** updated (ID: `{id}`). Changed: [list of changed fields]"

On error, show the error message and suggest:
- Verify the deal ID is correct — run `/search-deals` to find it
- Check that stage IDs are valid — run `get_deal_pipelines_with_stages`
- Check that custom field IDs and contact IDs are valid

## Updating multiple deals

If the user wants to apply the same change to multiple deals, repeat Steps 1 and 3–4
for each. Summarize at the end:
> "Updated N deals: [list of company names]"
