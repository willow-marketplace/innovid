# Changelog

All notable changes to Endor Labs Agent Kit and the generated `ai-plugins`
distribution are tracked here.

The current generated package version is `2.1.0`. Merging to `main` does not
automatically increment this version. Maintainers bump `pyproject.toml`
intentionally for a release, regenerate artifacts, and use the same version
across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Cursor, and Cursor SDK
package metadata.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added customer-owned Agent Policy Packs with a public JSON Schema, template
  and examples, `validate-policy-pack` and `evaluate-policy-pack` CLI commands,
  trusted fact preflight, and generated policy outputs across all source agents.
- Added an OpenAPI-derived Endor API resource and enum registry with a generator
  for validating source instructions, knowledge-pack query fields, and rendered
  `--field-mask` values.

### Changed

- Refreshed the pinned Endor OpenAPI and client/service provenance to
  v1.7.1069, including `ECOSYSTEM_VSCODE` registry coverage.
- Enhanced `findings-browser` with compact complete-count queries and
  `FINDING_TAGS_*` filters for exploited, fix-available, and reachable findings.
- Extended `malware-response` to query tenant `FINDING_CATEGORY_MALWARE`
  evidence and distinguish Endor classifications from external intelligence.
- Extended `cicd-posture` to prefer Endor-ingested repository, CODEOWNERS, and
  tag-protection evidence before falling back to the read-only GitHub API.
- Prioritized exploited findings in `sca-remediation` before VersionUpgrade/UIA
  evidence selects an upgrade candidate.

### Fixed

- Made policy comparisons fail closed on invalid operand types, added trusted
  `invalid_facts` provenance, and introduced explicit numeric dotted-version
  operators instead of coercing version strings through generic comparisons.
- Added policy fact preflight for scope and `when` applicability facts, marked
  WebSphere packs as reference-only, and report their missing evidence as the
  blocking `unavailable` decision.
- Hardened field-mask validation to bind masks to individual commands, scan
  source agent instructions, resolve service-backed resource schemas, and fail
  loudly when an Endor resource mask cannot be validated.
- Report malformed policy-pack YAML as concise CLI validation errors instead
  of Python tracebacks.
- Recomputed workflow policy decisions from a separately trusted fact bag and
  rejected omitted, additional, or modified agent-reported evaluations.
- Aligned runtime policy-pack validation with the public JSON schema by
  rejecting unknown fields, malformed conditions, and missing policy messages.
- Restored compact generated namespace preflight wording required by catalog
  guardrails, including Endor namespace/config provenance and credential input
  literals.
- Extended Endor API registry drift checks to validate knowledge-pack field
  lists as well as every rendered `--field-mask`, and wired the check into
  blocking Agent Kit CI.
- Pinned the OpenAPI JSON under `source/endor-context/` so registry checks run
  offline against the same spec recorded in provenance.
- Scoped Project Resolution Preflight injection to recipes that declare
  `project_resolution`, keeping package-level and workspace-independent agents
  out of project-resolution guidance.
- Clarified generated data-gap taxonomy and findings-browser filter guidance so
  unavailable evidence and QA-only defaults stay machine-readable.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Added fail-open Claude Code primary-plugin advisory hooks for prompt routing,
  dependency install intent, and dependency manifest edits.
- Added the read-only `findings-browser` source agent for browsing existing
  Endor findings across Claude Code, Claude Managed Agents, Codex, Gemini,
  Portable, Cursor, and Cursor SDK surfaces.
- Added the `cicd-posture` read-only Enterprise source agent for CI/CD and
  supply chain posture assessment from existing Endor findings plus read-only
  GitHub evidence, including deterministic score validation.
- Added release changelog coverage for the Agent Kit source repository and the
  generated `ai-plugins` distribution mirror.
- Added MIT license coverage to the Agent Kit source repository, matching the
  public `ai-plugins` distribution license.
- Added source-to-distribution changelog syncing so generated `ai-plugins` PRs
  carry release notes with package artifacts.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `ai-plugins` distribution sync omitting the generated root `hooks/`
  directory that `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` references, which shipped a
  dangling Cursor hooks pointer in the public mirror.
- Extended the generated-artifact drift gates and mirror validation to cover
  root `hooks/`, per-package hook manifests and scripts, and dangling
  `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` references.
- Changed the scheduled Endor context refresh workflow from an automated PR
  creator into a signal-only manual refresh gate, matching repository policy
  that GitHub Actions must not create pull requests.

### Changed

- Updated `cicd-posture` scoring to formula `cicd-posture-v2`, using
  conservative scores for unobserved workflow evidence and less aggressive
  Endor finding saturation.
- Bumped the legacy Claude `ai-plugins` package to `1.2.0` because its content
  gained the `findings-browser` agent; the legacy package still ships no hooks.
- Clarified that Agent Kit maintainer merges open generated `ai-plugins` sync
  PRs, but package version updates are explicit release actions.
- Preserved AURI branding in agent prompts and generated package content.
- Refreshed release-readiness docs for the current package version, MIT license
  status, public mirror path wording, and canonical provider documentation URLs.
- Refreshed provider documentation notes for the Gemini CLI to Antigravity CLI
  transition and clarified that Endor context refreshes use human-authored,
  signed PRs.
- Rechecked Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Cursor, and Endor
  Labs provider release documentation on 2026-06-16 before cutting 2.1.0.

### Removed

- Removed a stale project-local Codex agent file from `.codex/agents/`; Codex
  plugin agents are generated under `plugins/codex/endor-labs-agent-kit/`.

### Compatibility

- Claude Code keeps both package IDs: new installs should use
  `endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`, while existing `ai-plugins@endorlabs`
  installs remain supported through the legacy package directory.
- Cursor does not have a separate legacy `ai-plugins` package ID. Existing
  customers installing from the `ai-plugins` repository root continue to receive
  the current `.cursor-plugin/`, root `agents/`, root `skills/`, root `hooks/`,
  and `assets/logo.png` package.
- Gemini CLI keeps the generated package at
  `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/`, while the repository root keeps only
  `.mcp.json` and non-installable `GEMINI.md` support context. Root
  `gemini-extension.json` and the old Gemini zip artifact are intentionally not
  generated or supported.
