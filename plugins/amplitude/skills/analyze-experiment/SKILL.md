# Experiment Analyst

Perform comprehensive, detailed deep-dive analysis of experiments to make data-driven ship/no-ship decisions. This is NOT a quick summary - provide thorough insights with specific numbers and business implications.

## When to Use

- Analyzing completed experiment results for ship decisions
- Checking on running experiment progress and early signals
- Understanding why an experiment succeeded or failed
- Investigating unexpected results or segment-level effects

---

## Analysis Philosophy

**Be comprehensive, not brief:**
- Include specific numbers, percentages, and data points
- Explain statistical meaning AND business implications in plain language
- Cover all metrics (primary, secondary, guardrails) with actual values
- This is a single comprehensive analysis - do not rush or provide superficial summaries

---

## Instructions

### Step 0: Identify Experiment

**If user provides a specific experiment:**
- Accept experiment **URL or experiment ID**
- If URL: use `Amplitude:get_from_url` to extract details
- If ID: proceed to Step 1

**If user asks about experiments generally:**
- Use `Amplitude:search` with `entityTypes: ["EXPERIMENT"]` and relevant query terms
- Present top 3-5 matches with names, IDs, and states
- Ask user which experiment to analyze

**If no experiment specified:**
- Ask explicitly for experiment URL, ID, or search terms and stop

---

### Step 1: Retrieve and Validate Setup

Use `Amplitude:get_experiments` with experiment ID to capture:

- Experiment name, key, description, and state
- Start/end dates and duration
- Variants: names, traffic allocation
- Attached metrics: primary (recommendation=true), secondary, guardrails (stores as IDs)
- Bucketing strategy

**Get metric names:**
- Extract metric IDs from the experiment response (e.g., "c4pn8fkv")
- **CRITICAL: Amplitude MCP cannot retrieve metric names by ID directly**
- Workaround options:
  1. Search for experiment-related charts using `Amplitude:search` with `entityTypes: ["CHART"]` and experiment name
  2. Use `Amplitude:get_charts` on related charts to examine their definitions for metric references
  3. Check if experiment description contains links to metric documentation
- If metric names cannot be found, report as descriptive placeholders:
  - Primary metric: "Primary Goal Metric (ID: {id})"
  - Secondary metrics: "Secondary Metric {index} (ID: {id})"
  - Include metric IDs so users can look them up in Amplitude UI

**Validation:**
- Is experiment running or completed? (not draft)
- Has it run for 1+ weeks?
- Are variants and metrics clearly defined?

If incomplete, explain what's missing and stop.

---

### Step 2: Check Data Quality (with explicit thresholds)

Use `Amplitude:query_experiment` (primary metric only) to assess:

**Traffic Balance (SRM Check):**
- Report actual traffic split per variant (e.g., 48.2% control, 51.8% treatment)
- **Use `srmDetected` field from API:** Flag if `srmDetected: true`
- SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch) indicates the observed traffic split deviates significantly from the expected allocation
- If SRM detected, report the expected vs. actual allocation with specific percentages
- Severe SRM can indicate instrumentation issues or bucketing problems that may invalidate results

**Sample Size Analysis:**

**A. Current Sample Assessment:**
- Report total users per variant with specific numbers
- **Flag if <100 users per variant** (insufficient for any conclusion)
- **Flag if 100-1000 users** (directional signals only, not confident decision)
- Need 1000+ per variant for confident decisions

**B. Statistical Power Analysis:**
- **Target effect size:** What minimum lift would be meaningful for the business? (typically 2-5% for conversion metrics)
- **Achieved power:** Given current sample size and observed variance, what's the probability of detecting the target effect if it exists?
- **Power interpretation:**
  - <50%: Severely underpowered - likely to miss real effects
  - 50-70%: Underpowered - high risk of false negatives
  - 70-80%: Marginally adequate - consider extending if p-value is borderline
  - 80%+: Well-powered - sufficient to detect target effect size
- **If underpowered:** Calculate additional sample size needed to reach 80% power
- **Recommendation:** If power <70% and results are inconclusive, extend duration rather than making premature decision

**C. Precision Analysis (Confidence Interval Width):**
- **CI width for primary metric:** Report the width of the 95% confidence interval as percentage of baseline
- **Precision assessment:**
  - CI width >10% of baseline: Low precision - effect size uncertainty too high for confident decisions
  - CI width 5-10% of baseline: Moderate precision - acceptable for directional decisions
  - CI width <5% of baseline: High precision - narrow enough for confident decisions
- **Actionability threshold:** Is the CI narrow enough to distinguish between practically significant and negligible effects?
  - If lower CI bound suggests meaningful lift but upper bound is marginal, precision may be insufficient
  - Example: If target is +5% lift and CI is [-2%, +12%], too wide to confidently conclude effect exceeds target
- **Recommendation:** If CI too wide, extend duration or increase traffic allocation to improve precision

**Comprehensive Data Quality Flags:**

The `Amplitude:query_experiment` API returns multiple boolean flags that assess statistical validity. Check and document each:

1. **statsAssumptionsMetForWholeExperiment:**
   - Indicates whether core statistical assumptions are satisfied (normality, independence)
   - **If false:** Results may not be reliable; consider non-parametric approaches or longer runtime
   - Impact: High - affects all statistical conclusions

2. **hasSuspiciousUplift:**
   - Flags unexpectedly large effect sizes that may indicate data quality issues
   - **If true:** Verify instrumentation, check for bot traffic, or segment anomalies
   - Impact: High - may indicate measurement error rather than real effect

3. **isVariancePositive:**
   - Confirms metric variance is positive (mathematically required for statistical tests)
   - **If false:** Critical data quality issue - metric may be constant or incorrectly computed
   - Impact: Critical - statistical tests invalid if false

4. **isConfidenceIntervalNotFlipped:**
   - Ensures lower CI bound < upper CI bound (mathematical consistency check)
   - **If false:** Indicates calculation error or data corruption
   - Impact: Critical - results cannot be trusted

5. **isStandardErrorLargeEnough:**
   - Checks if standard error is sufficient for reliable inference
   - **If false:** High variance or very small sample may produce unreliable confidence intervals
   - Impact: Medium - affects precision of estimates

6. **isPointEstimateInsideConfidenceInterval:**
   - Validates that point estimate falls within its confidence interval (consistency check)
   - **If false:** Calculation error or numerical instability
   - Impact: High - indicates statistical computation issues

7. **isMeanValid:**
   - Confirms mean value is a valid number (not NaN, not infinite)
   - **If false:** Data quality issue - check for null values or computation errors
   - Impact: Critical - cannot analyze if mean is invalid

**For each flag that fails (returns false or true for suspicious uplift), document:**
- Which flag failed
- What it means in plain language
- Specific impact on result reliability
- Recommended action (extend duration, investigate instrumentation, etc.)

**If all flags pass:** Note this explicitly as strong data quality signal

**Temporal Stability:**
- Check if primary metric is stable day-over-day
- Note ramp period (first 24-48hrs) or day-of-week effects

**Document all data quality issues found** - these affect result reliability.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Primary Metric

Use `Amplitude:query_experiment` **without metricIds** to get primary metric only.

**Use metric name from Step 1** - Report using the human-readable metric name, not the metric ID.

Extract and report:
- **Control baseline:** metric value and sample size
- **Treatment performance:** metric value and sample size
- **Absolute lift:** treatment - control
- **Relative lift:** (treatment - control) / control × 100%
- **P-value:** with interpretation
- **Confidence interval:** report 95% CI bounds

**Interpret:**
- ✅ **Statistically significant:** p < 0.05 and CI doesn't include 0
- ⚠️ **Trending:** 0.05 < p < 0.15 (suggestive but inconclusive)
- ❌ **No effect:** p ≥ 0.15 or CI includes 0

**Practical significance:**
- Is the lift magnitude meaningful for the business?
- Small lifts (<2-3%) may not be worth complexity even if significant
- Consider metric's business impact (revenue vs. low-value engagement)

---

### Step 4: Analyze Secondary Metrics & Guardrails

Use `Amplitude:query_experiment` **with metricIds** for all metrics.

**Use metric names from Step 1** - Report using human-readable metric names, not metric IDs.

**For each secondary metric:**
- Report metric name (from Step 1 mapping), variant performance, and statistical significance
- Note which moved and which didn't (with specific numbers)
- **Identify unintended consequences:** Flag any negative impacts with specific values

**For each guardrail:**
- ✅ No regression: neutral or positive (p > 0.05)
- ⚠️ Marginal concern: small negative lift (1-5%) with p < 0.10
- 🚩 **Significant regression:** negative lift with p < 0.05 - report actual numbers

**Key question:** Are any metrics showing degradation (revenue, retention, engagement, error rates)?

**Multiple testing:** If analyzing 5+ metrics, consider Bonferroni correction (alpha = 0.05 / number of metrics)

---

### Step 5: Comprehensive Segment Analysis

Use `Amplitude:query_experiment` with `groupBy` parameter (one at a time).

Test 3-4 high-signal segments:
1. **Platform** (iOS, Android, Web)
2. **User tenure** (new vs. established users)
3. **Plan type** (free vs. paid)
4. **Geography** (country, region)

**MANDATORY: Format results as markdown breakdown tables**

For each segment analysis, present results in this exact format:

| Segment | Control Rate | Control Exposures | Control % of Total | Treatment Rate | Treatment Exposures | Treatment % of Total | Relative Lift | Significant? |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| iOS | 48.7% | 1,234 | 45.2% | 55.4% | 1,456 | 54.8% | **+13.6%** | Yes (p=0.02) |
| Android | 63.9% | 567 | 20.8% | 65.1% | 589 | 22.2% | +1.9% | No (p=0.45) |
| Web | 51.2% | 928 | 34.0% | 50.8% | 611 | 23.0% | -0.8% | No (p=0.89) |

**Calculate % of Total:**
- Sum all exposures across segments to get total
- Show each segment's share: (segment exposures / total exposures) × 100%
- This reveals which segments drive overall results

**Key insights:**
- Identify segments where treatment performs **best** (targeted rollout opportunity)
- Identify segments where treatment **hurts** (consider exclusions)
- Explain why different segments show different performance
- **Watch for Simpson's Paradox:** Overall result may differ from all segment results

Use `groupByLimit: 10` to avoid overwhelming output.

---

### Step 6: Assess Duration & Runtime Sufficiency

**Duration Assessment:**
Based on the power and precision analysis from Step 2, evaluate if the experiment has run long enough:

**Runtime factors:**
- **Minimum duration:** Has experiment run at least 1-2 weeks to capture full user lifecycle?
- **Learning effects:** For feature changes, have users had time to adapt? (typically 3-7 days)
- **Weekly seasonality:** Has experiment captured at least one complete week to account for day-of-week patterns?
- **Business cycles:** For B2B products, has it run through full business week patterns?

**Integration with Step 2 power analysis:**
- **If Step 2 showed adequate power (>80%) AND p < 0.05:** Experiment has sufficient data, duration is adequate
- **If Step 2 showed low power (<70%) AND p > 0.05:** Inconclusive due to insufficient data, extend duration
- **If Step 2 showed adequate power (>80%) AND p > 0.15:** Sufficient data to accept null result (no effect)
- **If Step 2 showed adequate power but CI width too wide:** Need more data for precision, extend duration

**Velocity projection (only if extending recommended):**
- **Current daily enrollment:** Calculate users per day per variant
- **Days to target sample:** Based on Step 2 power calculation, how many more days needed?
- **Days to target precision:** Based on Step 2 CI width calculation, how many more days to reach desired precision?
- **Recommendation:** Provide specific date when experiment should reach sufficient power/precision

**Do NOT repeat the power calculations from Step 2** - reference those findings and focus on duration and timeline recommendations.

---

### Step 7: Understand Why (Qualitative Context)

**For significant results (positive or negative):**

Use `Amplitude:get_feedback_insights`:
- Filter by experiment date range
- For wins: look for `["lovedFeature", "mentionedFeature"]`
- For losses: look for `["bug", "complaint", "painPoint"]`
- Check if themes align with experiment hypothesis

**Connect quantitative to qualitative:**
- Explain the lift with user quotes or feedback themes
- Present 2-3 representative examples with specific details

---

### Step 8: Synthesize Findings and Make Recommendation

**Before finalizing, verify you have included:**
- ✓ All primary metric data (lift, CI, p-value, interpretation)
- ✓ All data quality findings (SRM, sample size, power, precision, all 7 validity flags with actual values)
- ✓ All secondary metrics and guardrails (with actual values and significance)
- ✓ All segment analysis tables (formatted with % of total exposures)
- ✓ Statistical power assessment (current power, required sample, duration)
- ✓ Qualitative insights (feedback themes)

## Key Scenarios & How to Handle

### Inconclusive Results (p > 0.05)

**Diagnose:**
- Check statistical power: Is sample size adequate? Report current power percentage
- Check confidence interval: Very wide = high variance, need more data
- Check segments: Effect may exist in specific subgroup

**Action:**
- If power <60%: Extend duration or increase traffic allocation
- If power >80% but p >0.15: Accept null result (no effect detected)
- Check segment tables: Look for subgroups with significant effects

---

### Guardrail Regressed

**Diagnose:**
- Quantify trade-off with specific numbers: +10% conversion but -2% retention
- Which segments drove the regression? Check segment tables
- Is regression statistically significant or just noise?

**Action:**
- Small regression + large primary win + not significant = ship with monitoring
- Significant regression on critical metric = iterate to fix or abandon
- Segment-specific regression = consider targeted rollout excluding affected segments

---

### Segment Tables Show Opposite Effects

**Simpson's Paradox detected:**
- Overall result may be misleading if segments show opposite directions
- Example: Overall +5% lift, but iOS -10%, Android +15%

**Action:**
- Report the paradox clearly with specific segment numbers
- Consider targeted rollout to segments that benefit
- Exclude or iterate for segments that are harmed

---

## Best Practices

**Comprehensive analysis:**
- ✅ Include ALL data from tool calls with specific numbers
- ✅ Format segment analysis as breakdown tables with % of total
- ✅ Check statistical power and duration adequacy
- ✅ Verify data quality before drawing conclusions
- ✅ Connect quantitative results to qualitative insights

**Statistical rigor:**
- ✅ Report confidence intervals, not just p-values
- ✅ Distinguish statistical vs. practical significance
- ✅ Apply multiple testing correction for 5+ metrics
- ✅ Check for Simpson's Paradox in segment analysis

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Don't provide brief summaries - be comprehensive
- ❌ Don't omit data quality issues or negative secondary metrics
- ❌ Don't ignore segments - they reveal critical insights
- ❌ Don't make recommendations without adequate power
- ❌ Don't stop analysis early because primary looks good

## For Experiment Design

If user wants to **design a new experiment**, guide them through:

1. **Define hypothesis:** "We believe [change] will cause [users] to [behavior] because [reason]"

2. **Select metrics:**
   - Use `Amplitude:search` with `entityTypes: ["METRIC"]` to find candidates
   - Primary: directly measures hypothesis
   - Guardrails: revenue, retention, core engagement (prevent unintended consequences)

3. **Estimate sample size:**
   - Typical: 1-2 weeks minimum, 1000+ users per variant
   - Higher variance metrics need more data
   - Use `Amplitude:query_chart` to check metric's historical variance

4. **Create experiment:**
   - Use `Amplitude:create_experiment` with projectIds, variants, and metrics
   - Return experiment ID, URL, and deployment key for engineering

For detailed setup guidance, consider using the `setup-experiment-and-flags` skill.
