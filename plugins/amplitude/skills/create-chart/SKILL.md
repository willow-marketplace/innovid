# Create Amplitude Chart

Create charts from natural language by discovering events, building chart definitions, and verifying results.

## Planning First (Critical)

Before any tool calls, decompose the request:

**1. Identify chart components:**
- Chart type and metric (what's being measured)
- Time range (default: Last 30 Days if not specified)
- Primary event (the action being counted)
- Segment conditions (user filters/groups)
- Filters, groupings, breakdowns
- Funnel steps (if conversion analysis)

**2. Plan event searches:**
- ONE search per distinct event concept
- Never combine multiple concepts in one search
- Example: "purchase" and "signup" need separate searches

**3. Plan parallel tool calls:**
- Get context, search events, find cohorts can run together
- Wait for results before building definition

## Event Discovery (Critical: Discovery First)

**IMPORTANT: Cast a wide net before narrowing down**

When the user's request is ambiguous or could map to multiple events:
1. Search BROADLY first to discover relevant options
2. Review relevant results - look for related events, custom events, meta events
3. Present options to user OR explain your selection rationale
4. Try not to assume a single event is the only answer without exploration

**Search for events:**
```
Amplitude:search with entity_types=['EVENT', 'CUSTOM_EVENT']
```
- Search ONE concept at a time
- Use broad search terms first (e.g., "AI" not just "AI chat")
- ✓ Good: "user completes purchase"
- ✗ Bad: "signup or purchase events"

**Make informed decisions, then explain:**
1. Search broadly to discover all options
2. Review results and identify the most comprehensive/accurate approach
3. Make your best judgment call (prefer aggregated custom events over single events)
4. **Always explain**: "I found X, Y, Z options. I chose [X] because [reason]. This includes/excludes [scope]."
5. User can correct if your assumption was wrong

**Decision criteria:**
- Prefer custom events that aggregate related activity (e.g., "[2026] Activation Metric [AI events only]")
- If no aggregated event exists, choose the primary interaction event
- Consider what "active user" typically means for that product area
- Default to broader scope unless user specifies narrow focus

**Examples:**
- ❌ BAD: User asks "weekly AI users" → immediately pick "ai-chat: send message" without exploring, no explanation
- ✅ GOOD: User asks "weekly AI users" → search "AI", find Ask AI, Agents, Visibility, custom aggregated event. Respond: "I found AI activity across Ask AI, Agents, and Visibility. I'm using the '[2026] Activation Metric [AI events only]' custom event which includes all AI product interactions. This gives you total AI users across all features. Let me know if you want to focus on a specific AI product instead."

**Verify before use:**
- Get existing charts using the event via search
- Check event has actual volume (not zero/stale)
- Look for custom events that aggregate related activity
- If zero results, search for alternatives

**Get properties:**
```
Amplitude:get_event_properties for exact property names/values
```

**Find cohorts:**
```
Amplitude:search with entity_types=['COHORT']
Amplitude:get_cohorts to get full definitions
```

## Chart Type Selection

| Chart Type | Use When |
|------------|----------|
| `eventsSegmentation` | Counting events/users over time, trends, comparisons, KPIs, distributions, property analytics |
| `funnels` | Multi-step conversion analysis with a **known sequence**, drop-off analysis, time between specific events, time-to-convert metrics |
| `retention` | User return behavior, cohort retention curves, churn analysis |
| `dataTableV2` | Tabular comparisons, rankings, multi-dimensional breakdowns |
| `customerJourney` | Path exploration, discovering **unknown paths** users take, comparing converted vs dropped-off paths |
| `sessions` | Session duration, session frequency, time spent per user, session length distributions |

### Quick Reference

**eventsSegmentation** - Most versatile. Use for:
- User counts (DAU, WAU, MAU) with `uniques` metric
- Event totals, averages, sums of properties
- Percentiles, distributions, formulas
- Time series with rolling windows

**Aggregation Scope (eventsSegmentation):**
- `PROPSUM(A)` / `metric: "sums"` = Global sum across ALL events
- `metric: "frequency"` = Distribution of per-user event counts (how many users did it 1x, 2x, 3x)
- For "distribution of property sum per user": Amplitude does not support this directly. Use `metric: "frequency"` for event count distributions, or use dataTableV2 grouped by user_id with PROPSUM, then export for external analysis.

**funnels** - Conversion analysis with **predefined steps**. Use for:
- Step-by-step conversion rates when you know the expected sequence
- Ordered or unordered sequences
- Time-to-convert (median time between events)
- Exclusion events, conversion windows
- Overlapping events: To find users who performed multiple events (in any order), use a funnel with "any order" and set the conversion window to match the chart date range
- Note: If you want to **discover** what paths users take, use `customerJourney` instead

**retention** - Return behavior. Use for:
- N-day or rolling retention curves
- Cohort analysis (new vs returning users)
- Start event → Return event patterns

**dataTableV2** - Tabular data. Use for:
- Breakdowns by dimensions (country, platform, etc.)
- Multi-metric comparisons in table format

**customerJourney** - Path exploration and discovery. Use for:
- Understanding the actual paths users take (vs. expected paths in funnels)
- Analyzing paths starting with, ending with, or between two specific events
- Comparing converted vs dropped-off user paths side by side
- Discovering unexpected navigation patterns or friction points
- Exploring path frequency, similarity, or average time to complete
- Bridging the gap between ideal customer journeys and actual user behavior

**sessions** - Session-based engagement metrics. Use for:
- Session duration analysis (average length, time spent, distributions)
- Session frequency (average sessions per user, total sessions)
- Time spent per user over time
- Events performed within sessions (average events per session)
- Comparing session behavior across user segments

**Special metrics:**
- User counts: `metric: "uniques"`
- Event counts: `metric: "totals"`
- Property sums: `metric: "sums"` with property in `group_by`
- Rates/percentages: Use when comparing groups of different sizes

**Meta events:**
- `_active`: Any active event (DAU, MAU)
- `_new`: New users (first-time event)
- `_any_revenue_event`: Revenue events

## Chart Definition Structure

**Core parameters (all chart types):**
```json
{
  "name": "Descriptive Chart Title",
  "projectId": "12345",
  "definition": {
    "app": "12345",
    "type": "eventsSegmentation",
    "params": {
      "range": "Last 30 Days",
      "events": [{
        "event_type": "Purchase Completed",
        "filters": [],
        "group_by": []
      }],
      "metric": "uniques",
      "countGroup": "User",
      "interval": 1,
      "segments": [{"conditions": []}]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key parameters:**
- `countGroup`: "User" (unique users) or "Event" (event occurrences)
- `interval`: 1 (daily), 7 (weekly), 30 (monthly)
- `segments`: User filters/groups (empty array = all users)

**Event filters (inline OR logic):**
```json
"filters": [{
  "group_type": "User",
  "subprop_key": "country",
  "subprop_op": "is",
  "subprop_type": "event",
  "subprop_value": ["United States", "Canada"]
}]
```

**User segments (conditions AND logic):**
```json
"segments": [{
  "name": "Active Users",
  "conditions": [{
    "type": "property",
    "group_type": "User",
    "prop_type": "user",
    "prop": "plan",
    "op": "is",
    "values": ["Pro", "Enterprise"]
  }]
}]
```

**Cohort segments:**
Search for cohort, get ID, then:
```json
"segments": [{
  "name": "My Cohort",
  "conditions": [{
    "type": "cohort",
    "group_type": "User",
    "cohort_id": "abc123",
    "op": "is_in"
  }]
}]
```

## Workflow: Create Chart

1. **Get context:**
```
Amplitude:get_context (for projectId)
```

2. **Discover events** (BROAD search first):
```
Amplitude:search for each distinct concept
- Use broad search terms initially
- Look for all related events, custom events, cohorts
- Review ALL results before selecting
```

3. **Evaluate and decide:**
- Review all discovered events and custom events
- Make informed decision (prefer aggregated events)
- Prepare clear explanation of what you found and your choice

4. **Find similar charts** (see examples):
```
Amplitude:search entity_types=['CHART'] query="similar concept"
Amplitude:get_charts to see definition structure
```

5. **Get properties if needed:**
```
Amplitude:get_event_properties
```

6. **Build definition** using discovered names
- Explain event selection rationale in response

7. **Create chart:**
```
Amplitude:query_dataset with full definition
```

8. **Verify results** - check data makes sense

9. **Save chart:**
```
Amplitude:save_chart_edits with editId from query_dataset
```

## Error Handling

**If query_dataset fails:**
- Read error message carefully
- Common issues: incorrect event names, invalid filters, wrong parameter types
- Fix definition and retry
- Verify events exist via search first

**If zero results:**
- Check filters aren't too restrictive
- Verify event has data (search for charts using it)
- Try broader time range
- Check segment conditions

## Best Practices

**Naming:**
- Include metric + time context: "Weekly Active Users Last 90 Days"
- Not: "WAU" or "Users"

**Time ranges:**
- Default to "Last 30 Days"
- Use inclusive ranges for specific periods
- State interpreted range explicitly

**Verification:**
- Always verify event exists before using
- Check similar charts to understand event usage
- Confirm properties with get_event_properties

**Comparisons:**
- Use segments for comparing user groups on same chart
- Use rates/percentages for different-sized groups

**Always include:**
- Chart URL in response
- What the chart shows
- Key insights from initial data
- Methodology used
