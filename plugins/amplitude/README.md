# Amplitude Analysis and Instrumentation Plugin

> Use Amplitude MCP as an expert analyst, product manager, and instrumentation partner via chart creation, dashboard creation, chart analysis, dashboard reviews, experiment analysis, experiment monitoring, opportunity discovery, feedback synthesis, account health analysis, daily and weekly briefs, analytics instrumentation workflows, and more.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Claude CLI**.

---

## Installation

Claude Code: (CLI Application)
```bash
# Add the Amplitude marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add amplitude/mcp-marketplace

# Install this plugin
/plugin install amplitude@amplitude
```

Cursor:
- Go to cursor settings
- Click on Plugins
- Look for the Amplitude Analytics plugin
- Install the plugin
- You can test if the skills exist by typing /
- For the skills to work you need to have the amplitude MCP server
- You can add the MCP server to cursor by going to agent settings
- Agent settings -> Tools & MCP -> Add a new MCP server
- Add the following server to the config:
    "amplitude-us": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
            "-y",
            "mcp-remote",
            "https://mcp-server.prod.us-west-2.amplitude.com/v1/mcp"
        ]
    }
- This should take you to the browser to complete the 0Auth flow

## Usage

**Just ask naturally** – skills auto-trigger based on your request:

```
"Analyze this chart: [URL]"                        → analyze-chart activates
"Review my KPI dashboard before the meeting"       → analyze-dashboard activates
"What are customers saying about the new feature?" → analyze-feedback activates
"How healthy is Acme Corp's account?"              → analyze-account-health activates
"Analyze the results of our onboarding experiment" → analyze-experiment activates
"Create a chart showing weekly active users"       → create-chart activates
"Build a dashboard for our growth team"            → create-dashboard activates
"Give me my daily download"                        → daily-brief activates
"Find product opportunities"                       → discover-opportunities activates
"Check on experiments"                             → monitor-experiments activates
"Instrument the checkout flow"                     → add-analytics-instrumentation activates
