# DSQL Development Guide

DSQL is the **PREFERRED** relational database. This decision was made for fast serverless distributed SQL,
effortless scaling, multi-region viability, among other advantages.

## Best Practices

- **SHOULD read guidelines first** - Check [development-guide.md](development-guide.md) before making schema changes
- **SHOULD use preferred language patterns** - Check [language.md](language.md)
- **SHOULD Execute queries directly** - PREFER MCP tools for ad-hoc queries
- **REQUIRED: Follow DDL Guidelines** - Refer to [DDL Rules](#schema-ddl-rules)
- **SHALL repeatedly generate fresh tokens** - Refer to [Connection Limits](auth/authentication-guide.md#connection-rules)
- **ALWAYS use ASYNC indexes** - `CREATE INDEX ASYNC` is mandatory
- **MUST serialize arrays** into a single-column representation; **PREFER `JSONB`** (operators work directly); **MAY use `TEXT`** when the column is opaque to the database; **ASK** the user - see [Schema Design Rules](#schema-design-rules)
- **ALWAYS Batch within row limit** - maintain transaction limits (verify via `awsknowledge`: `aurora dsql transaction limits`)
- **REQUIRED: Build and sanitize all SQL with `safe_query.build()`** - See [Input Validation](../mcp/tools/input-validation.md#required-pattern)
- **MUST follow correct Application Layer Patterns** - when multi-tenant isolation or application referential integrity are required; refer to [Application Layer Patterns](#application-layer-patterns)
- **REQUIRED use DELETE for truncation** - DELETE is the only supported operation for truncation
- **SHOULD test any migrations** - Verify DDL on dev clusters before production
- **Plan for Horizontal Scale** - DSQL is designed to optimize for massive scales without latency drops; refer to [Horizontal Scaling](auth/scaling-guide.md)
- **SHOULD use connection pooling in production applications** - Refer to [Connection Pooling](auth/authentication-guide.md#connection-pooling-recommended)
- **SHOULD debug with the troubleshooting guide:** - Always refer to the resources and guidelines in [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)
- **ALWAYS use scoped roles for applications** - Create database roles with `dsql:DbConnect`; refer to [Access Control](access-control.md)

## Operational Rules

### Query Execution

**For Ad-Hoc Queries and Data Exploration:**

- MUST ALWAYS Execute DIRECTLY using MCP server or psql one-liners
- SHOULD Return results immediately

**Writing Scripts REQUIRES at least 1 of:**

- Permanent migrations in database
- Reusable utilities
- EXPLICIT user request

---

### Schema Design Rules

- MUST verify column types via `awsknowledge`: `aurora dsql supported data types` or the [DSQL supported data types list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/working-with-postgresql-compatibility-supported-data-types.html)
- MUST serialize arrays into a single-column representation — DSQL has no array column type:
  - **PREFER `JSONB`** — `@>`, `?`, `?|`, `?&`, and `jsonb_array_elements_text(data)` work directly; values validated and normalized at write
  - **MAY use `TEXT`** when the column is opaque to the database (application reads the whole value, parses it, never queries inside)
- For document columns:
  - **`JSONB`** when querying with `@>`, `?`, or indexed JSONB paths
  - **`JSON`** when writes dominate (no parse/sort overhead), when byte-exact input matters (audit, replay, payloads with duplicate keys), or when only `->`/`->>` is needed
  - **SHOULD keep** existing `JSON` columns as `JSON` when migrating; **MAY upgrade to `JSONB`** if the application needs JSONB-only operators or indexed paths
  - ASK the user about query patterns and read/write ratio before defaulting
- **MUST NOT** add per-column `COLLATE` clauses — DSQL uses C collation database-wide and rejects `COLLATE "C"` in DDL. `dsql_lint(fix=true)` auto-strips `COLLATE` clauses from migrated schemas (rule `collation`, fix status `fixed`).
- ALWAYS include tenant_id in tables for multi-tenant isolation
- SHOULD create async indexes for tenant_id and common query patterns

### Schema (DDL) Rules

- REQUIRED: **at most one DDL statement** per operation
- ALWAYS separate schema (DDL) and data (DML) changes
- MUST use **`CREATE INDEX ASYNC`:** No synchronous creation (verify limits via `awsknowledge`: `aurora dsql index limits`)
  - MAXIMUM: **24 indexes per table**
  - MAXIMUM: **8 columns per index**
  - **MUST** verify index is ready before relying on it: `SELECT indisvalid FROM pg_index WHERE indexrelid = 'index_name'::regclass` — queries work but skip the index until `indisvalid = true`
- **Asynchronous Execution:** DDL ALWAYS runs asynchronously
- To add a column with DEFAULT or NOT NULL:
  1. MUST issue ADD COLUMN specifying only the column name and data type
  2. MUST then issue UPDATE to populate existing rows
  3. MAY then issue ALTER COLUMN to apply the constraint
- MUST issue a **separate ALTER TABLE statement for each column** modification.

### Transaction Rules

Verify current limits via `awsknowledge`: `aurora dsql transaction limits`

- SHOULD modify **at most 3,000 rows** per transaction
- SHOULD have maximum **10 MiB data size** per write transaction
- SHOULD expect **5-minute** transaction duration
- ALWAYS expect repeatable read isolation

---

### Application-Layer Patterns

**MANDATORY for Application Referential Integrity:**
If foreign key constraints (application referential integrity) are required,
instead implementation:

- MUST validate parent references before INSERT
- MUST check for dependents before DELETE
- MUST implement cascade logic in application code
- MUST handle orphaned records in application layer

**MANDATORY for Multi-Tenant Isolation:**

- tenantId is ALWAYS first parameter in repository methods
- ALL queries include WHERE tenant_id = ?
- ALWAYS validate tenant ownership before operations
- ALWAYS reject cross-tenant data access

### Migration Patterns

- REQUIRED: One DDL statement per migration step
- SHOULD Use IF NOT EXISTS for idempotency
- SHOULD Add column first, then UPDATE with defaults
- REQUIRED: Each DDL executes separately

## Quick Reference

### Schema Operations

```sql
CREATE INDEX ASYNC idx_name ON table(column);          ← ALWAYS ASYNC
ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c VARCHAR(50);                ← ONE AT A TIME
ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c2 INTEGER;                   ← SEPARATE STATEMENT
UPDATE table SET c = 'default' WHERE c IS NULL;        ← AFTER ADD COLUMN
```

### Supported Data Types

**MUST verify** column types against the [DSQL supported data types docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/working-with-postgresql-compatibility-supported-data-types.html) or via `awsknowledge`: `aurora dsql supported data types` — the supported set evolves, so do not treat any static list as exhaustive.

Arrays and `INET` are **[runtime-only](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/working-with-postgresql-compatibility-supported-data-types.html#working-with-postgresql-compatibility-query-runtime)** — cast at query time. For structured data, **PREFER `JSONB`** when querying inside the value (`@>`, `?`, indexed JSONB paths); `JSON` is valid when writes dominate, byte-exact input matters, or only `->`/`->>` is needed. ASK the user about query patterns before defaulting.

### Supported Key

```
PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT (in CREATE TABLE)
```

Join on any keys; DSQL preserves DB referential integrity, when needed application referential
integrity must be separately enforced.

### Transaction Requirements

Verify current limits via `awsknowledge`: `aurora dsql transaction limits`

```
Rows: 3,000 max
Size: 10 MiB max
Duration: 5 minutes max
Isolation: Repeatable Read (fixed)
```
