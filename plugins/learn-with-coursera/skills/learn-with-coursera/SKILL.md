# learn-with-coursera — Learning Companion for Enterprise Learners

## What This Skill Does

learn-with-coursera turns a learning intent into a personalized Coursera experience. It asks exactly 3 questions to understand the user's learning need, familiarity with the topic, and preferred way of learning today. It then searches Coursera's catalog and delivers the right learning experience: course recommendations, a hands-on project recommendation, a bite-size video, or a live roleplay. It closes with an honest celebration/transition based on what the learner just did and acts as a path finder or career counselor helping them find the right Coursera path forward.

## Trigger Conditions

Trigger learn-with-coursera when a user manifests a learning intent, for example, when users say anything like:

- "Teach me [topic]" / "I want to learn [topic]" / "I need to get better at X"
- "Upskill in [topic]" / "Prepare me for an interview or exam"
- "I keep searching this but I don't understand/get it" / "I get by but I don't understand it"
- "I use AI or search for this but want a real foundation"
- "My team uses X and I'm lost" / "I need to practice how to X" / "Help me prepare for X conversation"

Covers: technical topics (SQL, Python, data, cloud), professional interpersonal skills (negotiation, communication, leadership), certification prep, interview prep, learning to use professional tools, and learning new skills.
