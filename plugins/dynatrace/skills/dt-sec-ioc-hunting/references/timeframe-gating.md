# Timeframe Gating

Log and span hunt queries default to a 30-minute window, matching the Dynatrace
UI default view. This reference defines when and how to retry on timeout and
when to widen on empty results.

## Default Windows

| Data source | Default window | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch logs` | `from:now()-30m` | Matches DT UI default. Use `matchesPhrase(content, "<ioc>")` as the unscoped prefilter; raw `contains(content, ...)` across all logs may hit Grail's 10-second limit. |
| `fetch spans` | `from:now()-30m` | Matches DT UI default. High volume; root-span fan-out. Even 1h can exceed read limits. |
| `security.events` detections | `from:now()-2h` | Hunt leg 3 via `hunt-security-events.md`; field semantics and drill-down owned by `dt-sec-insights` (widen to 24h on empty) |
| `security.events` RVA vulnerabilities | `from:now()-30m` | Snapshot window; widening has no effect |

## Event-Anchored Hunts

When IoCs are extracted from a specific detection, security event, log line,
span, or other timestamped record, do **not** start with `from:now()-30m` if that
would miss the source event. Use the source timestamp as the anchor and search a
surrounding evidence window first.

Default anchored window:
`from:<event_time - 30m>, to:<event_time + 30m>`

Use this for fields such as `finding.time.created`, event `timestamp`, log
`timestamp`, span `timestamp`, or any user-provided event time.

Rationale:
- The 30 minutes before the event can reveal reconnaissance, scanning, or setup.
- The event time covers the triggering activity itself.
- The 30 minutes after the event can reveal follow-up requests, exfiltration, or
  lateral movement.
- The bounded absolute window is often cheaper and more reliable than a broad
  `now()-1h` query.

Rules:
1. Keep the same log/span hunt template; replace only the `from:` / `to:` range.
2. Never set `to:` in the future. If `event_time + 30m` is later than now, use
   `to:now()` or omit `to:`.
3. If multiple source events are supplied, either run one window per event or use
   a combined bounded window from the earliest `event_time - 30m` to the latest
   `event_time + 30m`; report which choice was used.
4. If the anchored window returns zero rows and the user wants broader discovery,
   then follow the interactive expansion protocol from that point.
5. If the anchored window hits `FETCH_EXEC_TIME_LIMIT`, treat it as
   INCONCLUSIVE and prefer entity scoping or smaller per-event windows before
   widening.

Example:

```dql-template
fetch spans, from:toTimestamp("2026-07-16T11:53:27Z"), to:toTimestamp("2026-07-16T12:23:27Z")
| filter request.is_root_span == true
...
```

### Optional Scope Pre-Filtering for Logs

Raw `contains(content, ...)` has no column index. On high-volume tenants unscoped
15-minute windows can hit Grail's 10-second execution limit. Prefer the
`matchesPhrase(content, "<ioc>")` prefilter from `hunt-logs.md` for broad
unscoped discovery before considering entity scoping.

**Unscoped hunts are valid** when the user has only IoCs and no entity context.
`FETCH_EXEC_TIME_LIMIT` is INCONCLUSIVE, not a failure. Never add a scope filter
that the user did not provide — it narrows the lookup domain and can miss evidence.

When `FETCH_EXEC_TIME_LIMIT` occurs on `fetch logs` or `fetch spans`:

**Automatic timeout retry (no user approval required — narrowing, not widening):**
1. Confirm the query uses literal `matchesPhrase(content, "<ioc>")` clauses, not
   raw `iAny(contains(content, allObservables[]))` as the first content filter.
2. If the query form is correct and the 30m run timed out, automatically retry
   at **15m** without asking the user.
3. If 15m still times out, automatically retry at **5m**.
4. If 5m times out, the leg is **INCONCLUSIVE** — stop retrying.

At each retry, record the reduced window and continue. After INCONCLUSIVE, ask
the user whether to narrow by entity scope or accept INCONCLUSIVE.
If the user provides entity context (namespace, host, service): re-run with
the appropriate scope pre-filter.
See `hunt-logs.md` → "Scoped vs Unscoped Hunting" for filter examples.
Do NOT widen the window as a substitute for scoping — widening increases scan
volume further.

## Interactive Mode (standalone agent use)

The default initial window is `from:now()-30m` for unanchored hunts. For hunts
derived from a timestamped detection/log/event, use the event-anchored window
above as the initial window. When the user explicitly requests a specific initial
window — whether narrower (e.g. "last 5m") or wider (e.g. "last hour", "last 3
hours") — honor that request directly and use it as the starting window. Never
use a window different from what the user specified; apply the default 30m only
when no window is given.

**Timeout retry (automatic, no approval needed):** If the initial 30m run hits
`FETCH_EXEC_TIME_LIMIT`, retry at 15m, then 5m. Only mark INCONCLUSIVE if 5m
also times out. See "Optional Scope Pre-Filtering for Logs" above for details.

**Expansion (zero-match, requires approval):** Expansion is step-by-step and
requires explicit user approval to move beyond the current window. If the user
gives blanket approval (e.g. "expand if nothing shows up"), treat that as
approval for the full step sequence below (still report each window used).
1. Run hunt at the initial window (default `from:now()-30m`, or the
   user-requested window if one was specified).
2. Report result and ask approval before the next step (`from:now()-1h`).
3. If approved, run `from:now()-1h` and report the result.
4. If still empty, ask approval before `from:now()-3h`.
5. If approved, run `from:now()-3h` and report the result.
6. If still empty, ask approval before `from:now()-24h`.
7. If approved, run `from:now()-24h` and report the result.
8. Stop at 24h by default. Go beyond (up to 7d) only if the user explicitly
requests it.

Never run a wider query without explicit approval for that step.
Never run two window sizes in parallel.

Expansion sequence:
`30m -> 1h -> 3h -> 24h -> 7d (only if explicitly requested)`

## Autonomous Mode (sub-agent invocation)

When this skill is loaded by a parent agent programmatically (no human in the
loop), the approval gate is bypassed:

1. Run hunt at `from:now()-30m`.
2. If `FETCH_EXEC_TIME_LIMIT`, automatically retry at 15m, then 5m.
3. If zero rows (at whichever window completed), do not auto-expand. Report:

"No matches found in the last 30 minutes (searched window: now()-30m).
Expansion to 1h, 24h, or 7d would require user approval."

3. Surface the empty result so the user can decide whether to widen later.

Default mode is autonomous unless set otherwise by the orchestrator.
