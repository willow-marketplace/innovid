# Security Contextualization Skill

Resolve security signals and entity attribute sets to runtime Dynatrace
Smartscape entities, summarize findings across entity levels, and connect
signals that land on different levels (e.g. a detection on a `K8S_POD` vs.
a CVE on a `KUBERNETES_NODE`) via a shared runtime entity.

## What This Skill Covers

- **Identity → Smartscape mapping** — given a row carrying any of
  `dt.smartscape_source.id`, `container_image.digest`, `container_image.id`,
  `host.ip`, `dt.entity.*`, or `k8s.*` fields, resolve it to a Smartscape
  entity at any requested level (CONTAINER / K8S_POD / workload /
  K8S_NODE / HOST / cloud / `GENAI_SERVICE` — AI/GenAI workloads).
- **Artifact → runtime bridge** — `container_image.digest` →
  `smartscapeNodes CONTAINER` → `is_part_of.*` → parent workload or
  `runs_on.host` → HOST. Works without pre-enriched `dt.smartscape_source.id`.
- **Cross-level correlation** — tiered entity matching to determine whether
  two findings (e.g. a detection and a CVE from different legs) relate through
  a shared runtime entity. Tier 1: exact entity id match; Tier 2: same
  workload/pod/host by name; Tier 3: same namespace/cluster (context-only —
  does not contribute to scoring).
- **Pod → node topology** — resolve `K8S_POD` to its `K8S_NODE` via
  `k8s.node.name` (co-projected field) or Smartscape edge traversal. Enables
  "detection hit pod X — does that pod run on a vulnerable node?"
- **Coverage match recipes** — 2-way and 3-way container→workload match
  patterns shared across dt-sec-insights coverage counting queries.
- **Entity enrichment** — given findings, IoC matches, or raw Smartscape
  nodes, produce per-entity risk-level breakdowns and entity-key bundles for
  downstream scoring.
- **IoC enrichment** — attribute an already-matched IoC (IP / domain / URL /
  email / CVE / hash / MITRE TTP) with adversary context (actor, malware family,
  MITRE technique, targeting, provider) by reverse-looking-up the ingested
  `THREAT_REPORT` events whose observable arrays contain that IoC.

## When to Use This Skill

| Intent / trigger | Reference |
|---|---|
| Map findings / IoC matches to workloads, hosts, or cloud entities | `identity-mapping.md` -> `entity-enrichment.md` |
| Which Smartscape entity does this container image / digest run as? | `identity-mapping.md` § Mapping Primitive (Path 2 - container digest) |
| Do this detection and this CVE relate via a shared entity? | `correlation-and-coverage.md` § Correlation |
| Pod X fired - does it run on a vulnerable node? | `correlation-and-coverage.md` § Correlation (Pod->Node Topology) |
| Per-entity risk summary (Critical/High/Medium/Low) | `entity-enrichment.md` |
| Coverage match recipe - which workloads are covered by product Y? | `correlation-and-coverage.md` § Coverage |
| Which entity-identity fields are relevant to a finding type? | `identity-mapping.md` § Data Model |
| Enrich a matched IoC (IP/domain/hash/CVE/...) with threat-report adversary context | `ioc-enrichment.md` |
| Scope findings to AI/GenAI workloads; which processes belong to an AI service; resolve a process to its AI service | `identity-mapping.md` § Mapping Primitive (Path 4 - `GENAI_SERVICE -> SERVICE -> PROCESS`) |

## How This Skill Is Organized

1. **SKILL.md** (this file) — entry point and routing.
2. **references/**
   - [**identity-mapping.md**](references/identity-mapping.md) — generalized
     identity->Smartscape resolver (mapping primitive Paths 1/2/3/4), pre-flight
     identifier checks, level selection, and entity-identity field guidance.
   - [**entity-enrichment.md**](references/entity-enrichment.md) — consumers of
     the mapping primitive: cloud (Path 1), K8s workload (3-way), host-by-IP,
     host-by-entity, natural-language fallback, problem->entities->findings chain.
     Per-entity risk-level breakdowns (Critical/High/Medium/Low).
   - [**correlation-and-coverage.md**](references/correlation-and-coverage.md) —
     cross-level entity convergence, pod->node topology resolution, scoring contract,
     and 2-way/3-way coverage match recipes shared with dt-sec-insights.
   - [**ioc-enrichment.md**](references/ioc-enrichment.md) — reverse-lookup IoC
     enrichment: attribute a matched IoC to ingested `THREAT_REPORT` events and
     surface adversary context (actor / malware / MITRE / targeting). Single and
     batch (per-IoC) templates; supported-IoC taxonomy.

## Universal Best Practices

1. **Always load `dt-dql-essentials` first** — DQL syntax and function names
   differ from SQL. Confirm all functions before generating queries.
2. **Ground every query in a named template** — do not improvise Smartscape joins.
   The 3-way match, digest→CONTAINER→workload, and pod→node traversal patterns
   are precise; deviating produces silent zero-row results.
3. **Run the pre-flight check before the full 3-way enrichment** — external
   providers vary widely. Confirm at least one identifier path is populated
   before running the expensive append chain.
4. **Check `dt.smartscape_source.type` before trusting Path 1** — a non-null
   `dt.smartscape_source.id` is not proof of workload-level resolution; the
   field may point to a namespace, cluster, or cloud resource. Only K8s workload
   types (`K8S_DEPLOYMENT`, `K8S_DAEMONSET`, `K8S_STATEFULSET`, `K8S_CRONJOB`,
   `K8S_JOB`, `K8S_REPLICASET`) are eligible for workload enrichment via Path 1.
5. **Dedup early and after `append`** — dedup before joins to collapse
   re-ingested duplicates; dedup again after `append` because the same finding
   can match multiple paths.
6. **Tier 3 correlation is context only** — same namespace/cluster shared by
   two findings does not raise the exposure score. Never treat a cluster-level
   shared attribute as proof of entity-level relatedness.
7. **Route topology queries to `dt-obs-kubernetes`** — pod→node placement and
   Smartscape edge traversal patterns live in
   `dt-obs-kubernetes/references/pod-node-placement.md`. Do not re-author
   them here; reference them and apply the output in `correlation-and-coverage.md`.
8. **No `dt.system.bucket` filters** — security event data may live in any
   bucket; filtering by bucket risks hiding findings.
9. **THREAT_REPORT is the one `security.events` query allowed here — reverse
   lookup only.** `ioc-enrichment.md` attributes a *matched IoC* to reports
   (IoC → report). Broad THREAT_REPORT overviews, IOC rollups, and forward
   report → environment correlation stay in `dt-sec-insights`
   (`threat-intelligence.md`). Never author finding/posture queries here.
