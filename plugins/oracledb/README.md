# Oracle Database

> [!NOTE]
> Currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This repository packages [MCP Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox)'s prebuilt `oracledb` server as a plugin/extension to interact with [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/) instances. It can be used with various AI agents, including [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/), [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), to manage your databases, execute queries, explore schemas, and troubleshoot issues using natural language prompts.

## Why Use Oracle Database?

- **Seamless Workflow:** Integrates seamlessly into your AI agent's environment. No need to constantly switch contexts for common database tasks.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Stop wrestling with complex commands. Explore schemas and query data by describing what you want in plain English.
- **Full Database Insights:** Monitor active sessions, analyze query plans, and manage tablespace usage using natural language.
- **Code Generation:** Accelerate development by asking your agent to generate data classes and other code snippets based on your table schemas.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- One of these AI agents installed:
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v0.6.0** or higher
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) version **v2.1.94** or higher
  - [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex) **v0.117.0** or higher
  - [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google) **v1.14.2** or higher
- Access to an Oracle Database instance.
- Oracle Database permissions:
  - `CREATE SESSION` for basic connectivity.
  - `SELECT` privileges on `V$` and `DBA_` views for monitoring and diagnostics.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Please keep these settings handy during the installation process:

- `ORACLE_CONNECTION_STRING`: The connection string for your Oracle Database (e.g., `host:port/service_name` or TNS alias).
- `ORACLE_USERNAME`: Your Oracle database username.
- `ORACLE_PASSWORD`: Your Oracle database password.
- `ORACLE_WALLET`: (Optional) Path to the directory containing your Oracle Wallet files.
- `ORACLE_USE_OCI`: (Optional) Set to `true` to use the OCI (thick client) driver.

### Installation & Usage

To start interacting with your database, install the extension for your preferred AI agent, then launch the agent and use natural language to ask questions or perform tasks.

For the latest version, check the [releases page][releases].

[releases]: https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/oracledb/releases

<summary id="antigravity">Antigravity</summary>

You can use either of these two agents for Antigravity:
- [Antigravity CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) version **v0.2.7** or higher
- [Antigravity 2.0](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-2) version **v0.2.7** or higher.

<blockquote>
💡 <strong>Tip — Migrating from Gemini CLI?</strong><br>
If you previously installed this extension with <code>gemini extensions install</code>, you can convert it to an Antigravity plugin instead of reinstalling from scratch:
<ul>
  <li><strong>On first launch of Antigravity CLI</strong>, accept the Migration Options prompt to automatically convert your installed Gemini CLI extensions to Antigravity plugins.</li>
  <li><strong>Or, from your terminal</strong>, run:
    <pre><code class="language-bash">agy plugin import gemini</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
See <a href="https://antigravity.google/docs/gcli-migration">Migrating from Gemini CLI</a> for details on plugins, context files (<code>GEMINI.md</code> / <code>AGENTS.md</code>), and MCP server config differences.

## Installing via a compatible Agent Plugins client
## Installing via a compatible Agent Plugins client

This repository is a valid [Agent Plugins](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec) (v1) plugin. Any [Agent Plugins–compatible client](https://agent-plugins.org/compatible-clients) can install it directly using its own built-in plugin command — no extra tooling required — by pointing at this repository:

```
https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/oracledb
```

Beyond harnesses covered by the native install above, compatible clients include VS Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Kiro. See your agent's documentation for its exact install command.

**Set env vars:**
Set your environment vars as described in the [configuration section](#configuration).

## Usage Examples

Interact with Oracle Database using natural language:

- **Query Data:**
  - "Show me the first 10 rows from the EMPLOYEES table."
  - "What is the total salary by department?"
- **Generate Data:**
  - "Please generate and insert 10 rows of sample data into trainer_products."
  - "Populate the description_vector column. For every row, generate a vector based on the description column using the create_vectors tool."
- **Monitor and Analyze:**
  - "List all active sessions."
  - "Explain the execution plan for this query: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = 100"
  - "What is the tablespace usage?"
- **Object Health:**
  - "List all invalid objects in the schema."

## Available Tools

The tools come from MCP Toolbox's prebuilt `oracledb` server, grouped into toolsets:

- **oracle_database_tools** - Use these skills to manage and monitor Oracle databases by executing SQL statements, exploring schema metadata, analyzing query performance, monitoring active sessions and resource consumption, and managing storage and object health.

For the full, up-to-date list, see the [`oracledb` prebuilt config](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/blob/main/internal/prebuiltconfigs/tools/oracledb.yaml)
in the MCP Toolbox repository.

## Generating Skills Instead

The tool-backed skills this plugin used to ship were generated from the same prebuilt
toolsets. If your agent lacks deferred tool loading, or you prefer skills, regenerate
them with the script in this repository:

```bash
VERSION=<toolbox version> ./.github/scripts/generate_skills.sh
```

Use the toolbox version pinned in [`mcp.json`](./mcp.json). A single toolset, without
the script:

```bash
npx @toolbox-sdk/server@<toolbox version> --prebuilt oracledb skills-generate \
  --name "<skill name>" \
  --toolset "<toolset>" \
  --description "<what it is for>"
```

The generated scripts call the toolbox through `npx`, so no binary download is needed.
See [Generate Agent Skills](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox#generate-agent-skills)
in the MCP Toolbox repository.

## Additional Agent Skills

Find additional skills to support your entire software development lifecycle at [github.com/gemini-cli-extensions](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions).

## Troubleshooting

Use the debug mode of your agent (e.g., `gemini --debug`) to enable debugging.

Common issues:

- "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set correctly.
- "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn npx ENOENT": Node.js is not installed, or `npx` is not on your `PATH`. Install Node.js, which provides `npx`.
- "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded.
