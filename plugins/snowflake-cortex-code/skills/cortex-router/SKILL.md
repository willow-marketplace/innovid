# Cortex Code Router

Route Snowflake operations to Cortex Code CLI, which has specialized bundled skills
(data-quality, semantic-view, cost-intelligence, ML, governance, etc.).

**CRITICAL: Follow steps 1 → 2 → 3 in order. Do NOT skip to Step 3.**

## Step 1: Verify CLI

```bash
which cortex 2>/dev/null && cortex --version
```

If `cortex` is NOT found:
1. Tell the user: "Cortex Code CLI is not installed. Setting it up now."
2. Load the `snowflake-cortex-code:cortex-setup` skill using the Skill tool.
3. **STOP** — do not continue until the CLI is installed.

## Step 2: Confirm Routing

Run the routing script to check if this prompt should go to Cortex or stay in Claude Code:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/router/route_request.py" --prompt "USER_PROMPT_HERE"
```

Replace `USER_PROMPT_HERE` with the actual user prompt (shell-escaped).

**Read the output carefully:**
- If output says **"route: cortex"** → proceed to Step 3
- If output says **"route: claude"** → **STOP**. Handle the request yourself using Claude Code tools (sql_execute, Read, Write, etc.). Do NOT run execute_cortex.py.

## Step 3: Execute via Cortex Code

Only reach this step if Step 2 confirmed routing to Cortex.

Choose a security envelope based on the operation:
- **RO**: Read-only queries (SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE) — won't run DDL or DML
- **RW**: Data modifications, DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) — default for most operations
- **RESEARCH**: Read + web access, no writes
- **DEPLOY**: Full access (use sparingly)

Default to **RW** unless the request is clearly read-only.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/router/execute_cortex.py" \
  --prompt "USER_PROMPT_HERE" \
  --envelope "RW"
```

Add `--connection CONNECTION_NAME` if a specific Snowflake connection is needed.

### Multi-turn: `--resume-last` vs fresh

Every cortex invocation returns a `session_id` that the router persists. Follow-up
turns can resume that session so Cortex sees the prior conversation -- real
multi-turn, not one-shot batches per prompt.

- **Add `--resume-last`** when the current prompt is a continuation of the
  previous Cortex turn: "keep going", "apply the top suggestion", "dig deeper",
  "also show me ...", "and for last quarter", "fix that", or any clarification
  of an answer Cortex just gave.
- **Omit `--resume-last`** (start fresh) when the user switches topics, asks
  about a different database/warehouse, or begins a clearly new task.
- `--resume <session_id>` is also accepted if you have an explicit id.

```bash
# Follow-up on the previous Cortex turn
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/router/execute_cortex.py" \
  --prompt "drill into the top customer" --envelope "RO" \
  --resume-last
```

**Timeout**: This command may take 30-90 seconds. If it takes longer than 2 minutes, it likely hung — kill the process and tell the user to try `$cortex-run` for direct invocation.

## Step 4: Return Results

Format Cortex's output for the user:
- Show SQL results in readable tables
- Display any generated artifacts or analysis
- Report success/failure clearly

## Notes

- Cortex has bundled skills for: data-quality, semantic-view, cost-intelligence, ML, governance, security, lineage, dynamic-tables, and more
- For simple SQL queries that don't need Cortex skills, Step 2 should route to Claude Code
- If `route_request.py` is missing or fails, fall back to Claude Code tools
- Multi-turn context is preserved across invocations via `--resume-last` (see Step 3)
