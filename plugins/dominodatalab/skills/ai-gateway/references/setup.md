# Setup and compatible APIs

Use this reference for first requests, authentication setup, migration, and compatible clients.

## First request

1. Confirm a Vercel account and team are available.
2. For free AI Gateway Credits, the team needs a valid payment method. If the gateway returns `customer_verification_required`, use the action URL in the error.
3. Create an AI Gateway API key from the dashboard or CLI, or use OIDC for a Vercel deployment.
4. Export `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` in the shell or load it from an uncommitted environment file.
5. Fetch `/v1/models`, choose a current model, and make one request.
6. Print or return the result.
7. Open AI Gateway Logs and inspect the model, provider, usage, cost, status, and routing attempts. Allow about 90 seconds for ingestion.

Canonical tutorial: <https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/getting-started>

When a user asks a coding agent to make this request, the coding agent is the tool writing and running the API call. Its own inference does not need to use AI Gateway. The selected `provider/model` is the target of the request, not the identity of the coding agent. Routing the agent's own model traffic is a separate workflow routed from `SKILL.md`.

## API key setup

Dashboard: <https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai-gateway%2Fapi-keys&title=AI+Gateway+API+Keys>

```bash
export AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY="your_ai_gateway_api_key"
```

The key value is shown once. Never write it to committed source or print it in a response.

### Agent-safe credential handling

Reuse an existing key without revealing it. Do not inspect the environment with broad commands such as `env`, bare `set`, or `printenv`, and do not echo the value. Use a subshell so tracing is restored automatically:

```bash
(
  set +x
  if [ -n "${AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
    echo "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY is set"
  else
    echo "AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY is missing"
  fi
)
```

If the key exists, skip CLI login and team-scope discovery unless another requested operation needs them. If it is missing and the user authorized key creation:

1. Use the existing project CLI when available; otherwise use `npx vercel@latest` without installing globally.
2. Read `ai-gateway api-keys create --help` before choosing flags.
3. Reuse the current CLI team scope. Ask for a team only when that scope is missing or ambiguous.
4. Prefer an interactive prompt or OS credential store. Never put a literal key in shell history or a command argument, and never send raw key output through agent logs or chat.
5. Keep shell tracing disabled while a secret is in scope; prefer a subshell so the prior tracing state returns automatically.

For a one-request smoke test, report the generated content, whether the request succeeded, and any action the user must take. Do not dump authorization headers or an unfiltered raw response.

Use the CLI when the user asks for CLI management:

```bash
vercel ai-gateway api-keys create --name my-api-key
```

The CLI can bind a budget, spend alerts, and an expiry at creation, which beats re-editing the key later:

```bash
vercel ai-gateway api-keys create --budget 500 --alert-thresholds 75,100 --expiration 90d
```

`inspect` shows a key's budget, spend, BYOK spend, alerts, and expiry; `list` shows every key. Run `vercel ai-gateway api-keys create --help` before scripting because available quota, expiration, alert, and restriction-exemption flags change.

## OIDC setup

OIDC is preferred for Vercel deployments because the deployment receives `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` automatically. For local development against a linked Vercel project:

```bash
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

The current OIDC documentation states that locally pulled tokens are valid for 12 hours. Re-run `vercel env pull` when the token expires.

Do not say that OIDC removes request authentication. The token authenticates the request to AI Gateway. BYOK credentials are separate provider credentials.

Docs: <https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/authentication-and-byok/oidc>

## AI SDK

Current AI SDK JavaScript releases require Node.js 22 or later. Verify the installed package rather than upgrading an established project without approval.

A plain `provider/model` string uses AI Gateway:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const model = process.env.AI_GATEWAY_MODEL;
if (!model) {
  throw new Error('Set AI_GATEWAY_MODEL to an ID returned by /v1/models');
}

const { text } = await generateText({
  model,
  prompt: 'Explain this codebase.',
});

console.log(text);
```

Load the `ai-sdk` skill and read `node_modules/ai/docs/` before writing SDK-specific code. Use `@ai-sdk/gateway` exports only when needed. Do not add a provider-specific package for a model called through AI Gateway.

## AI SDK for Python

Current AI SDK for Python releases require Python 3.12 or later. Install and follow its current docs:

```bash
uv add ai
```

```python
import asyncio
import os
import ai


async def main() -> None:
    model = ai.get_model(os.environ['AI_GATEWAY_MODEL'])
    messages = [ai.user_message('Explain this project.')]

    async with ai.stream(model, messages) as stream:
        async for event in stream:
            if isinstance(event, ai.events.TextDelta):
                print(event.chunk, end='', flush=True)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Compatible clients

| Client or API | Base URL or endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions and OpenAI Responses SDKs | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1` |
| Anthropic Messages SDK | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh` |
| OpenResponses HTTP | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1/responses` |
| Cohere Rerank | Follow the current Cohere Rerank page |

Keep the client's request shape and replace its base URL and request authentication. AI Gateway model IDs remain `provider/model` strings even when using an OpenAI or Anthropic SDK.

Docs: <https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway/sdks-and-apis>

## Migration

For an existing integration:

1. Inventory the SDK, model IDs, provider-specific request fields, provider credentials, streaming behavior, and error handling.
2. Choose the closest AI Gateway API shape. An existing OpenAI or Anthropic client can usually keep its SDK.
3. Change request authentication and the base URL.
4. Map model IDs to live AI Gateway slugs. Do not mechanically prepend a provider name.
5. Preserve provider-specific options that the selected API supports.
6. Remove direct-provider credentials only after the AI Gateway path passes a live request.
7. Verify usage, cost, and routing in Logs.
