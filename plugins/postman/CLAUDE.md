# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

The Postman Plugin for Claude Code — a pure-markdown, configuration-driven plugin that provides full API lifecycle management via the Postman MCP Server. No compiled code, no runtime dependencies, no build step.

## Repository Structure

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Plugin manifest (name, version, metadata)
.mcp.json                    # MCP server auto-config (Postman MCP at mcp.postman.com)
commands/*.md                # 15 slash commands (/postman:<name>)
skills/*/SKILL.md            # 11 skills (knowledge, agent-ready APIs, CLI, send-request, generate-spec, run-collection, context, and Flows: list-flows, trigger-flow, deploy-flow, get-flow-run)
skills/*/references/*.md     # On-demand reference files loaded by skills only when needed
agents/readiness-analyzer.md # Sub-agent for API readiness analysis
examples/                    # Sample output (readiness report)
```

## How the Plugin Works

- Claude Code discovers components via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest
- `.mcp.json` auto-configures the Postman MCP server, providing `mcp__postman__*` tools. The server mode is switchable via `POSTMAN_MCP_MODE` (`mcp` full/default, `minimal`, or `code` — the latter two expose fewer tools; `minimal` lacks the `*Context` code-gen tools)
- MCP commands use the cloud Postman MCP Server — authenticate via OAuth in `/postman:setup` or a `POSTMAN_API_KEY` environment variable
- Routing is native: there is no routing skill. Claude matches user intent to commands/skills from their front-matter `description` fields, so descriptions must state when to use the component
- CLI commands use the locally installed Postman CLI (`npm install -g postman-cli`) — requires `postman login`
- Plugin is loaded with `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/postman-claude-code-plugin`

## Component Conventions

**Commands** (`commands/*.md`): YAML front matter with `description` and `allowed-tools`. Each defines a structured workflow invoked as `/postman:<name>`.
- MCP commands: setup, sync, search, test, mock, docs, security, learn (learn requires Full mode — `searchLearningCenter` is absent in `minimal`/`code`)
- CLI commands: request, generate-spec, run-collection, list-flows, trigger-flow, deploy-flow, get-flow-run

**Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): YAML front matter with `name`, `description`, `user-invocable`. Auto-injected context, not directly invoked. `postman-knowledge` provides MCP tool guidance; `agent-ready-apis` provides readiness criteria; `postman-cli` provides CLI and git sync file structure knowledge; `postman-context` provides API discovery, exploration, and code generation from real API definitions.

Large skills use progressive disclosure: a lean SKILL.md holds the workflow, and detailed rules live in `references/*.md` files inside the skill directory that the skill instructs Claude to Read only at the step that needs them (see `postman-context` and `generate-spec`). Keep new skills under ~6KB and put bulky templates/rules in references.

**Agent** (`agents/readiness-analyzer.md`): YAML front matter with `name`, `description`, `model`, `allowed-tools`. Runs as a sub-agent (sonnet model) for deep API readiness analysis (8 pillars, 48 checks).

## Key MCP Limitations

These are documented in `skills/postman-knowledge/mcp-limitations.md` and must be respected in all commands:

- `searchPostmanElements` is the unified search tool — pass `ownership: organization` (default) for the user's org resources, `external` for the public Postman network, or `all` for both. Use the `privateNetwork` filter to restrict to the Private API Network.
- `generateCollection` and `syncCollectionWithSpec` return HTTP 202 — must poll for completion
- `syncCollectionWithSpec` supports OpenAPI 3.0 only — use `updateSpecFile` + `generateCollection` for Swagger 2.0 or OpenAPI 3.1
- `createCollection` creates flat collections — nest via `createCollectionFolder` + `createCollectionRequest`
- `createSpec` struggles with specs >50KB — decompose into collection items instead

## Postman CLI Commands

Several commands use the Postman CLI instead of MCP. They require `postman-cli` installed locally (`npm install -g postman-cli`) and authenticated (`postman login`). If CLI is not found, show install instructions and stop.

- `/postman:request` — Send HTTP requests via `postman request <METHOD> <URL>`
- `/postman:generate-spec` — Scan code for API routes, generate OpenAPI 3.0 YAML, validate with `postman spec lint`
- `/postman:run-collection` — Run collection tests via `postman collection run <id>` using cloud IDs from `.postman/resources.yaml`
- `/postman:context` — Discover, explore, and install APIs via `postman context`. Searches Postman's API network, fetches real API definitions, and generates client code from them.
- `/postman:list-flows` — List flows in a workspace and resolve a flow name to its 24-char ID via `postman flows list`
- `/postman:trigger-flow` — Trigger a deployed flow via `postman flows trigger`, with a deploy-then-trigger fallback when the flow isn't deployed
- `/postman:deploy-flow` — Deploy a flow to make it triggerable via `postman flows deploy` (proposes and confirms a trigger path first)
- `/postman:get-flow-run` — Inspect a run by Run ID via `postman flows get-run` (per-block logs, failing block, status)

CLI commands work with Postman's git sync structure: `postman/collections/` (v3 folder format), `postman/environments/`, `postman/specs/`, and `.postman/resources.yaml` for cloud ID mapping.

## Development Notes

- There is no build, lint, or test suite — all "code" is instructional markdown
- Changes are purely editing markdown files with YAML front matter
- When adding a new command, follow the existing front matter pattern in `commands/`
- When adding a new skill, create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with proper front matter
- The `allowed-tools` field in front matter controls what tools a command/agent can use
- CLI commands need `Bash` in `allowed-tools`; MCP commands list the specific `mcp__postman__<toolName>` tools they call — never the `mcp__postman__*` wildcard. When a command's workflow gains a new MCP call, add that tool to its `allowed-tools`
- Front-matter `description` fields are injected into every user session — keep them to one or two sentences (what it does + when to use it)

## Versioning & Releases

- The plugin follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the single source of truth
- Every user-facing change bumps the version and adds an entry under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` (added a command/skill → minor; fix/tweak → patch; breaking change → major)
- To release: bump `plugin.json`, move `[Unreleased]` notes into a dated `## [X.Y.Z]` section, merge to `main`, then `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
- The `Release` GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggers on `v*` tags: it fails if the tag doesn't match `plugin.json`, extracts the matching CHANGELOG section, and publishes a GitHub Release with those notes
