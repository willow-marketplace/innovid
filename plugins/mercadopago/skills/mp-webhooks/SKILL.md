description: Configure and validate Mercado Pago webhooks. Wraps the MCP webhook tools (save_webhook, notifications_history) and provides the HMAC-SHA256 signature validation pattern that every receiver must implement. Use when adding, debugging, or hardening notification handling.

# mp-webhooks

This skill is for everything notifications. It is the only place where the HMAC validation pattern lives — every other skill defers here.

---

## Step 0 — Verify MCP is actually authenticated

`ListMcpResourcesTool` is unreliable for this MCP (always returns "No resources found"). The bootstrap tools `authenticate` / `complete_authentication` are always present and prove nothing.

Check whether `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__application_list` is callable AND returns a real payload.

### Soft gate — the receiver scaffold is static

Scaffolding the webhook receiver (Steps 1–2) is **static code** and needs no MCP. The gate is therefore **soft**:

- **Authenticated** → continue normally.
- **Loaded, not authenticated** → show the prerequisites checklist below + the OAuth prompt inline, then **continue to Steps 1–2** (the receiver scaffold). Do not block. The MCP is only required at Steps 4–6 (`save_webhook`, `notifications_history`) — re-gate per call there.
- **Plugin not loaded** → tell the user to run `/mcp`, enable `plugin:mercadopago:mcp`, and retry.

OAuth prompt (State B):

> Call `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__authenticate`, show the URL as a clickable link, and say: "When you see **Authentication Successful** in the browser, come back and say anything." When the user responds, call `application_list` directly — do NOT call `complete_authentication` first (it hangs when the callback was already consumed). Never ask the user to paste the callback URL — it contains a sensitive OAuth code.

Prerequisites checklist (State B):

```
Before configuring webhooks live, you'll need:
- [ ] A Mercado Pago developer account
- [ ] An app created in the Developer Dashboard
- [ ] Test credentials: APP_USR- access token + public key (tab {test_tab})
- [ ] The webhook signature secret (Dashboard → Webhooks → Signature secret)
Run /mp-connect to authenticate (only needed for Steps 4–6 below).
```

---

## Step 1 — Decide the action

Ask the developer (or infer from `$ARGUMENTS`) which of these they want:

| Action | Tool to call | When |
|--------|--------------|------|
| Configure the webhook URL on the MP application | `save_webhook` | First time setup or rotating the endpoint |
| Diagnose delivery failures | `notifications_history` | Investigating missed/failed notifications |
| Scaffold the receiver code | (no MCP call — render the pattern below) | Adding the receiver to the codebase |

You may chain them: scaffold the receiver → `save_webhook` → trigger a real test payment → use `notifications_history` to confirm delivery.

---

## Step 2 — Receiver pattern (HMAC-SHA256)

Mercado Pago signs every notification with the secret returned in the dashboard at *Webhooks → Signature secret*. The `x-signature` header is composed of `ts=...,v1=...` where `v1` is the HMAC-SHA256 of the canonical string `"id:{data.id};request-id:{x-request-id};ts:{ts};"`.

Every receiver MUST:

1. Read `x-signature` and `x-request-id` from the request headers.
2. Parse `ts` and `v1` out of `x-signature`.
3. Build the canonical string with `data.id` (from the JSON body) and `x-request-id` and `ts`.
4. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(canonical, secret)` and compare in constant time with `v1`.
5. **Respond `200` immediately** if the signature is valid — process the event asynchronously afterwards. Mercado Pago retries on non-200 responses with exponential backoff for up to ~24 hours.
6. Be **idempotent**: the same notification id may arrive more than once. Use `data.id` + topic as the dedup key.

### Canonical string

```
id:<data.id>;request-id:<x-request-id>;ts:<ts>;
```

### Reference snippet (Node.js, Express)

```js
import crypto from "node:crypto";

const SECRET = process.env.MP_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

export function mpWebhook(req, res) {
  const signature = req.header("x-signature") ?? "";
  const requestId = req.header("x-request-id") ?? "";
  const parts = Object.fromEntries(
    signature.split(",").map((p) => p.split("=").map((s) => s.trim()))
  );
  const ts = parts.ts;
  const v1 = parts.v1;
  const dataId = req.body?.data?.id;
  if (!ts || !v1 || !dataId || !requestId) return res.status(400).end();

  const canonical = `id:${dataId};request-id:${requestId};ts:${ts};`;
  const expected = crypto.createHmac("sha256", SECRET).update(canonical).digest("hex");

  const ok = expected.length === v1.length &&
             crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(v1));
  if (!ok) return res.status(401).end();

  res.status(200).end();
  // process asynchronously after responding 200
  queueMicrotask(() => handleEvent(req.body));
}
```

For other languages, query MCP `search_documentation` with:
- `"webhook signature validation {language}"` (e.g., python, java, php, ruby, go, dotnet).

---

## Step 3 — Topics

The notification body contains `type` (the topic) and `data.id`. Common topics:

| Topic | When | Resource to fetch |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| `payment` | Payment status change (Payments API) | `GET /v1/payments/{id}` |
| `orders` | Point / QR Code event (Orders API) | `GET /v1/orders/{id}` |
| `merchant_order` | Merchant order updated — legacy (Checkout Pro / QR attended via legacy API) | `GET /merchant_orders/{id}` |
| `topic_claims_integration_wh` | Chargebacks | `GET /v1/chargebacks/{id}` |
| `point_integration_wh` | Point device events — legacy (old Point Integration API) | Point legacy API — query MCP for the country |
| `subscription_preapproval` | Subscription status change | `GET /preapproval/{id}` |
| `subscription_authorized_payment` | Recurring charge attempt | `GET /authorized_payments/{id}` |

If a topic is not in this table, query MCP for the latest list rather than guessing.

---

## Step 4 — Configure on Mercado Pago (`save_webhook`)

> **Re-gate before this MCP call:** verify `application_list` is callable. If not, run the Step 0 State B OAuth flow first, then proceed.

```
mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__save_webhook(
  callback="https://<production-url>/mp/webhook",
  callback_sandbox="https://<staging-url>/mp/webhook",
  topics=["payment", "merchant_order", ...]
)
```

Confirm the response shows the URL and topics correctly registered.

---

## Step 5 — Smoke test (real test payment)

`simulate_webhook` no longer exists in the MCP. To test your receiver:

1. Make a real payment using test credentials + test user + test card
2. The webhook fires automatically when the payment status changes
3. Verify your receiver returned `200` and processed the event idempotently

Use `notifications_history` to confirm delivery:
```
mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__notifications_history()
```

---

## Step 6 — Diagnose missed deliveries

> **Re-gate before this MCP call:** verify `application_list` is callable. If not, run the Step 0 State B OAuth flow first, then proceed.

```
mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__notifications_history()
```

Returns delivery metrics and a breakdown of failures (timeouts, non-200 responses, signature mismatches). Use this when notifications are missing in production.

---

## Gotchas

- Respond `200` **before** processing. A long synchronous handler causes retries that flood the receiver and can mask the real failure.
- Mercado Pago retries on non-200 with exponential backoff up to ~24h — a transient bug becomes a flood of duplicates.
- Make handlers idempotent. Use `data.id` + `type` as the dedup key.
- Never trust the JSON body alone — always validate the signature first.
- IPN (the legacy `?id=&topic=` GET-style notification) is deprecated. New integrations use only the modern signed webhook described here.

---

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does **not** scaffold the surrounding integration. Use `mp-integrate`.
- It does **not** evaluate quality. Use `mp-review`.
- It does **not** invent topic names from memory — query MCP if unsure.
