### Checkout Pro

**What it is:** Hosted redirect checkout. The buyer leaves your site, pays on Mercado Pago's secure page, and returns via `back_url`. Mercado Pago handles all card data — no PCI scope for you.

**When to use:**
- You want the fastest integration with minimal frontend work
- You don't need to keep the buyer on your page during payment
- You want Mercado Pago's full payment method catalog (saved cards, MP balance, cash, BNPL) with zero configuration

**When NOT to use:**
- You need the buyer to stay on your page (use Bricks or Checkout API instead)
- You need granular control over the payment form layout

**Key payload fields (create preference):**
```json
{
  "items": [{ "title": "Product", "quantity": 1, "unit_price": 100.0, "currency_id": "ARS" }],
  "back_urls": {
    "success": "https://yoursite.com/success",
    "failure": "https://yoursite.com/failure",
    "pending": "https://yoursite.com/pending"
  },
  "auto_return": "approved",
  "notification_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhooks/mp",
  "external_reference": "order-uuid-here",
  "statement_descriptor": "YOUR STORE"
}
```

**Use `init_point`** from the preference response to redirect the buyer. Never use `sandbox_init_point` (deprecated, returns errors).

**Best practices:**
- Always set `external_reference` for reconciliation
- Always verify payment status server-side after redirect — never trust `back_url` query params alone
- `auto_return: "approved"` requires `back_urls.success` set; otherwise silently ignored
- `currency_id` must match the country (ARS, BRL, MXN, CLP, COP, PEN, UYU)
- The Orders API does NOT exist for Checkout Pro — always use `/v1/checkout/preferences`

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/checkout-pro/landing

---

### Checkout API (Orders mode)

**What it is:** Card payments processed entirely on your page. Buyer never leaves your site. Full control over the UI. Also called **Checkout Transparente** in Brazil.

**When to use:**
- You need the buyer to stay on your page
- You want full UI customization
- You're building a card-only or card-primary checkout

**Modes:**
- `orders` (recommended, new integrations) — uses `/v1/orders`
- `payments` (legacy) — uses `/v1/payments`. Still works but being deprecated.

**Flow (Orders mode):**
1. Client tokenizes the card via Mercado Pago JS SDK or Bricks `CardPayment`
2. Client sends card token + amount to your server
3. Server creates an order via `POST /v1/orders` with the card token
4. Server returns order status to client

**Key order creation payload:**
```json
{
  "type": "online",
  "processing_mode": "automatic",
  "total_amount": "100.00",
  "external_reference": "order-uuid",
  "payer": { "email": "buyer@example.com" },
  "transactions": {
    "payments": [{
      "amount": "100.00",
      "payment_method": {
        "id": "master",
        "type": "credit_card",
        "token": "<card_token_from_frontend>",
        "installments": 1,
        "statement_descriptor": "YOUR STORE"
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Always send `X-Idempotency-Key` header on every creation request
- `issuer_id` is required for some BINs in Argentina — include it when returned by tokenization
- Card tokens are single-use and expire in 7 days
- `installments` is required even for 1 in Argentina (MLA)
- For 3DS: set `binary_mode: false` on the payment to allow `pending` status (3DS challenge)
- Brazil queries: use "checkout transparente orders node brazil" in MCP `search_documentation`

### Checkout Bricks

**What it is:** Modular, pre-built React/JS UI components that handle card tokenization, payment method selection, and status display. PCI-compliant without touching card data directly.

**When to use:**
- You want a polished, ready-made checkout UI with minimal frontend work
- You want card tokenization handled by Mercado Pago (no PCI scope)
- You need to support multiple payment methods (cards + cash + wallet)

**Components:**

#### CardPayment Brick
Card-only form. Collects number, expiry, CVV, name, ID, email. Tokenizes and calls `onSubmit`.

```jsx
import { CardPayment } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';

<CardPayment
  initialization={{ amount: 100.00 }}
  onSubmit={async (formData) => {
    // formData.token = card token, formData.installments, formData.issuer_id
    const response = await fetch('/api/process-payment', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    });
    return response.json(); // must return a Promise
  }}
  onError={(error) => console.error(error)}
/>
```

**Critical:** `onSubmit` MUST return a Promise. Returning void keeps the brick in loading state forever.

#### Payment Brick
Full multi-method form (cards + MP wallet + cash). Superset of CardPayment.

```jsx
import { Payment } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';

<Payment
  initialization={{ amount: 100.00, preferenceId: '<preference_id>' }}
  onSubmit={async (formData) => { /* same as CardPayment */ }}
/>
```

Note: `preferenceId` must be created server-side per buyer session. Never hardcode a placeholder.

#### Wallet Brick
MP wallet button. Buyer must be logged into Mercado Pago.

```jsx
import { Wallet } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';
<Wallet initialization={{ preferenceId: '<preference_id>' }} />
```

#### StatusScreen Brick
Post-payment result display. Shows success, pending, or error state.

```jsx
import { StatusScreen } from '@mercadopago/sdk-react';
<StatusScreen initialization={{ paymentId: '<payment_id_from_order>' }} />
```

**Critical:** Pass `payment_id` from `order.transactions.payments[0].id`, NOT the `order_id`.

**Best practices for all Bricks:**
- The container `<div id="...">` must exist in the DOM before `bricksBuilder.create()`
- Call `brickController.unmount()` in React `useEffect` cleanup before re-mounting
- `back_urls` must be on the same origin as the page mounting the brick
- Ad-blockers (uBlock, Brave) block `sdk.mercadopago.com` → brick shows `FIELDS_SETUP_FAILED`
- Debit cards do NOT show installment selector — this is correct, not a bug
- Always show the total amount above the brick — the brick does not display it prominently
- Always scaffold loading/success/error states; never leave them as TODOs

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/checkout-bricks/landing

### QR Code

**What it is:** In-person payments where buyers scan a QR code on a display or printed sticker to pay via the Mercado Pago app.

**When to use:**
- Physical point of sale (retail, restaurants, events)
- Self-service kiosks
- Cashierless checkout

**Modes:**
| Mode | Use case | TTL |
|------|----------|-----|
| Static | Fixed QR per POS — buyer enters amount or amount is preset | No TTL |
| Dynamic | One QR per transaction — most secure and auditable | Short TTL per transaction |
| Hybrid | Static QR + amount displayed on screen | Per transaction |

**Setup flow (dynamic QR):**
1. Create a Store via `POST /stores`
2. Create a POS linked to that store via `POST /pos`
3. Create a QR order (amount + items) via `PUT /instore/orders/qr/seller/collectors/{user_id}/pos/{external_pos_id}/qrs`
4. Display the QR to the buyer
5. Receive webhook notification when buyer pays

**Best practices:**
- Static QR requires Store + POS to be created first — they are not auto-created
- Dynamic QR has a short TTL — generate one per buyer interaction, not one shared QR
- Wire webhooks to `orders` topic (Orders API) or `merchant_order` (legacy)
- Use `external_pos_id` for reconciliation across multiple registers

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/qr-code/landing

---

### MP Point

**What it is:** Physical card reader terminals (Point Smart 1, Point Smart 2) controlled via API. Accepts chip, NFC, magnetic stripe, and QR.

**When to use:**
- Physical retail with unified POS management
- Businesses needing automatic reconciliation across terminals
- When you want to create payment intents from your system and push them to a device

**Flow:**
1. Pair device to a User ID (NOT just the application)
2. Create a payment intent via API → terminal loads the payment request automatically
3. Buyer selects method and pays on the device
4. Receive webhook notification with result

**Critical gotchas:**
- Device must be paired to the correct User ID — wrong user pairing silently rejects payment intents
- After a firmware update the device may take ~2 min to come back online; don't retry aggressively
- Webhook topic for Orders API is `orders`. The legacy `point_integration_wh` topic belongs to the old API — do not use for new integrations
- Requires physical terminal purchase + Mercado Pago mobile app for initial setup

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/mp-point/landing

---

### Subscriptions

**What it is:** Recurring automated payments on a weekly, monthly, or yearly schedule. Mercado Pago handles retries on failure.

**When to use:**
- SaaS, memberships, clubs
- Donation platforms (variable amounts)
- Subscription boxes or recurring services

**Two models:**
| Model | How | Best for |
|-------|-----|---------|
| With plan | Create a `preapproval_plan` first, then subscriptions reference it | Multiple subscribers to the same tier |
| Without plan | Create a `preapproval` directly per subscriber | One-off or custom subscriptions |

**Key payload (preapproval with plan):**
```json
{
  "preapproval_plan_id": "<plan_id>",
  "payer_email": "subscriber@example.com",
  "card_token_id": "<token>",
  "back_url": "https://yoursite.com/subscription/confirm"
}
```

**Best practices:**
- A `preapproval` without `preapproval_plan_id` cannot be migrated to a plan later — choose model upfront
- Recurring charges retry automatically on failure; `paused` status is reachable both manually and after N failed attempts
- `back_url` for plan signup must be HTTPS in production
- Monitor `subscription_preapproval` and `subscription_authorized_payment` webhook topics

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/subscriptions/landing

---

### Marketplace

**What it is:** Split payment platform where a marketplace collects payments and distributes funds to sellers, keeping an `application_fee`.

**When to use:**
- Platforms with multiple sellers (e marketplace, on-demand services, gig economy)
- When you need to split a payment between your platform and a seller

**How it works:**
1. Seller authorizes your platform via OAuth flow → you receive seller's access token
2. Payment is created using seller's token + `application_fee` for your platform
3. Funds split automatically at settlement

**Key payload:**
```json
{
  "transaction_amount": 100.0,
  "application_fee": 5.0,
  "collector_id": "<seller_collector_id>",
  "token": "<card_token>",
  "installments": 1
}
```

**Best practices:**
- `application_fee` cannot exceed configured limits per country — check before charging
- OAuth Access Tokens for sellers expire in 6 months — always store `refresh_token` and renew before expiry
- Both `collector_id` and `application_fee` are required; missing either sends the full amount to the marketplace owner
- Sellers must explicitly authorize your platform — there is no silent linking

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/marketplace/landing

---

### Wallet Connect

**What it is:** One-click payments using the buyer's saved credentials in their Mercado Pago wallet, without re-entering card details.

**When to use:**
- Mobile commerce apps where buyers already have MP accounts
- Reducing checkout friction for returning buyers
- Subscription-like flows where you want to reuse buyer's saved payment method

**Flow:**
1. Buyer creates an agreement (authorization) linking their wallet to your app
2. You receive a payer token representing the buyer's saved method
3. Use the payer token to create payments without card data

**Best practices:**
- Buyer must explicitly approve the linkage via MP wallet UI — no silent linking possible
- Once linked, payments use buyer's saved methods — you don't pass card details
- Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate transactions
- Handle webhook notifications for agreement status changes

});
// terminals[].id format: "NEWLAND_N950__N950NCB801293324" (type + "__" + serial)
