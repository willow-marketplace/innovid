# mp-review

This skill audits a Mercado Pago integration. It does not duplicate the official quality criteria — it pulls them live from the MCP and verifies each one against the codebase.

---

## Step 0 — Verify MCP is actually authenticated

`ListMcpResourcesTool` is unreliable for this MCP (always returns "No resources found"). The bootstrap tools `authenticate` / `complete_authentication` are always present and prove nothing.

Check whether `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__quality_checklist` is callable AND returns a real payload. If not, **call `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__authenticate` immediately** and show:

> To continue I need access to your Mercado Pago account. Open this link to connect: **[Connect Mercado Pago]({url})**
When you see "Authentication Successful" in the browser, come back and say anything.

When the user returns, call `application_list` directly — do NOT call `complete_authentication` first. Never ask the user to paste the callback URL.

---

## Step 1 — Discover the integration

Use `Grep`/`Glob` to find:

- Files importing `mercadopago` (any SDK).
- References to `MP_ACCESS_TOKEN` or hardcoded `APP_USR-` / `TEST-` strings.
- Endpoint patterns: `/v1/payments`, `/v1/checkout/preferences`, `/v1/orders`, `payment.create`, `preference.create`, `order.create`, `preapproval.create`, `disbursement`.
- Webhook handlers (paths matching `webhook`, `notification`, `ipn`).

Determine:

- **API in use**: Payments API (`/v1/payments`) vs Orders API (`/v1/orders`). Both can coexist.
  - **If the integration uses the Payments API**, it is on the legacy path. The Payments API is being deprecated; Mercado Pago is pushing all integrations toward the Orders API. Always include a `Needs attention` item in the Implementation Report recommending the migration, with the file:line where `/v1/payments` is called. Do **not** treat it as a Blocker (existing code still works), but flag it as forward-looking technical debt.
  - **Exception**: Checkout Pro stays on preferences (the Orders API does not exist for Checkout Pro). Do not flag `/v1/checkout/preferences` as legacy.
- **Products in use**: Checkout Pro/API, Bricks, Subscriptions, Marketplace, etc. — derive from endpoint patterns and request payloads.

---

## Step 2 — Run the official quality checklist

Call `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__quality_checklist`. The response defines:

- **Required fields** — must be implemented to meet Mercado Pago's quality bar.
- **Best practices** — recommended improvements.

For **every** item returned (do not summarize, do not skip):

1. Search the codebase with `Grep`/`Read` for evidence of the item (a field, a header, a behavior).
2. Mark each item **Implemented**, **Missing**, or **Partial** with a one-line justification (the file/line that proves the verdict).

---

## Step 3 — Cross-cutting security checklist

These items are not always part of `quality_checklist` but are mandatory for any production integration. Always evaluate them:

| # | Check | How to verify |
|---|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Access token in `process.env` / equivalent — never hardcoded | Grep for `APP_USR-` / `TEST-` outside `.env*` and test fixtures |
| 2 | `.env` is in `.gitignore`, `.env.example` is **not** | Read `.gitignore` |
| 3 | Webhook handler validates `x-signature` (HMAC-SHA256) | See `mp-webhooks` skill — Grep for `x-signature`, `x-request-id`, `createHmac` |
| 4 | HTTPS enforced for `back_url` and `notification_url` | Grep for `http://` in URL building |
| 5 | Payment status verified server-side after redirect | Look for a server-side fetch of `/v1/payments/{id}` or `/v1/orders/{id}` after `back_url` |
| 6 | Idempotency key sent on payment/order creation | Grep for `X-Idempotency-Key` or SDK equivalent |
| 7 | `external_reference` set on every preference/order | Grep for `external_reference` |
| 8 | Test user credentials not committed to production deploy | Confirm test credentials are loaded from a separate env file or vault |
| 9 | `sandbox_init_point` not used anywhere | Grep for `sandbox_init_point` — flag any match as a bug; Mercado Pago has no sandbox, the URL is invalid in all environments |

---

## Step 4 — Run `quality_evaluation` (when compatible)

`mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__quality_evaluation` requires a real `payment_id`. Run it when the integration used the Payments API and produced a payment ID.

| Integration uses | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| Payments API (`/v1/payments`) | Ask the developer for a recent test `payment_id`, then call `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__quality_evaluation` with it. |
| Orders API only | Skip — incompatible. Mention in the report. |

```
mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__quality_evaluation(
  payment_id="<recent_test_payment_id>"
)
```

If the developer doesn't have a payment ID, skip and note in the report: `"quality_evaluation: skipped — no payment_id provided."`

---

## Step 4.5 — Homologation form (final step before production)

After quality_evaluation (or if it was skipped), offer the homologation form to the developer:

> "Before switching to production credentials, complete the official homologation checklist. This certifies your integration and activates it for production."

1. Call `mcp__plugin_mercadopago_mcp__form_homologation` with `action="get_form"`, `product_id` (from detected product), `site_id` (from detected country), `lang`, `is_ca` (true for Checkout API / Bricks).
2. Present each step/question to the developer via `AskUserQuestion`. Collect answers.
3. When all questions are answered, call with `action="submit"` and the collected `form_values`.
4. On success: congratulate the developer and confirm the integration is certified.

If the developer skips: note it in the Implementation Report under "Needs attention": `"Homologation form not submitted — required before production deployment."`.

---

## Step 5 — Render the Implementation Report (MANDATORY final step)

After Steps 1–4 are complete, **always** render an Implementation Report as the last block of the output. This is the deliverable the developer keeps — it summarizes what's done, what's pending, and what to do next. Do not skip it, do not summarize it in prose; render the structured block below verbatim.

The report is the source of truth for the developer's next session: it tells them exactly what was verified, what was flagged, and the next concrete action. Without it, the review feels open-ended and the developer doesn't know if they can ship.

### Security checklist (cross-cutting)
| # | Check | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|

### Recommendations
- {actionable, ordered by impact}

**Summary**: X/Y required fields implemented, Z/W best practices adopted, S/9 security checks pass.

> Want a deeper score? Provide a recent test payment ID (or order ID) and I'll run `quality_evaluation`.

## Implementation Report

### Verified
- [x] {item that passed — e.g., "Webhook handler validates x-signature with HMAC-SHA256"}
- [x] {next passing item}

### Needs attention
- [ ] {actionable item with file:line — e.g., "Add idempotency key to POST /v1/orders at api/orders.js:42"}
- [ ] {next pending item}
- [ ] {if legacy `/v1/payments` is detected — e.g., "Migrate POST /v1/payments to the Orders API (POST /v1/orders) at api/payments.js:42. The Payments API is being deprecated."}

### Blockers (must fix before production)
- [ ] {critical item — e.g., "Hardcoded APP_USR- token in config/mp.js:8 — move to env"}

### Next steps
1. {The single most impactful action the developer should take next}
2. {Follow-up actions in priority order}
3. Re-run `/mp-review` after fixes to confirm the report.

### Resources used
- MCP: `quality_checklist` ({date/time of call})
- MCP: `quality_evaluation` (if it was run, with the payment_id/order_id used)
- Skill: `mp-review` v4.2.0

**Scores**: {X}/{Y} required, {Z}/{W} best practices, {S}/9 security. **Verdict**: {Ready for production | Needs fixes | Blocked}.
```

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does **not** generate or scaffold code. Use `mp-integrate`.
- It does **not** call APIs that mutate state. `quality_evaluation` is read-only and only suggested.
- It does **not** rely on offline knowledge of "what should be in a review" — the official checklist is fetched live every time.
