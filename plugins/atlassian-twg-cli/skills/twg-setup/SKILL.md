name: twg-setup
description: Install, update, authenticate, or repair `twg` for your coding agent, including missing CLI or skills and doctor/auth follow-up. TWG gives your coding agent grounded work context across Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, JSM, Assets, Slack, Google Drive, and more, so it can connect tickets, docs, code, people, and decisions; surface risks and dependencies; summarize progress; and keep work moving.

# TWG Setup

Recognized installer hosts: `claude-code`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `devin`, `gemini`, `hermes`, `pi`, `qoder`.

## Unix / macOS

**Escape hatch — run in your terminal**

```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 2 https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install | bash
```

Recognized host variant:

```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 2 https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install | bash -s -- --plugin <host>
```

**Inspect**

```bash
TWG_BIN="$(command -v twg || true)"
if [ -z "$TWG_BIN" ] && [ -x "$HOME/.local/bin/twg" ]; then
  TWG_BIN="$HOME/.local/bin/twg"
fi
if [ -z "$TWG_BIN" ]; then
  echo "twg was not found at the standard launcher path; install TWG or add its directory to PATH." >&2
fi
[ -n "$TWG_BIN" ] && "$TWG_BIN" doctor || true
```

## Windows PowerShell

**Escape hatch — run in PowerShell**

```powershell
curl.exe -fsSL https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install.ps1 -o "$env:TEMP\twg-install.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\twg-install.ps1"
```

Recognized host variant:

```powershell
curl.exe -fsSL https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install.ps1 -o "$env:TEMP\twg-install.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\twg-install.ps1" -Plugin <host>
```

**Inspect**

```powershell
$twgCommand = Get-Command twg -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$TWG_BIN = if ($twgCommand) { $twgCommand.Path } else { $null }
if (-not $TWG_BIN -and $env:LOCALAPPDATA) {
  $fallback = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Programs\twg\bin\twg.exe"
  if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $fallback -PathType Leaf) { $TWG_BIN = $fallback }
}
if (-not $TWG_BIN) {
  Write-Warning "twg was not found; use the escape hatch above."
}
if ($TWG_BIN) {
  & $TWG_BIN doctor
}
```

## Common flow

Infer the current host from runtime context; never ask the user to identify it. Use its
plugin argument when recognized; omit it only when the host is genuinely unknown. Do not
narrate the plugin argument or describe attribution or analytics to the user.

1. Run the OS-specific **Inspect** block.
2. If the CLI is missing:
   - Full interactive terminal: after explicit approval, run the escape-hatch installer
     outside the sandbox only if prompts remain visible and answerable.
   - Limited terminal or failed download: give the OS escape hatch to the user; include the
     plugin argument for a recognized host. Do not execute it.
3. Treat a fresh install as complete only when every required installer stage succeeds. On
   fresh-install failure, provide only the failure explanation, full installer command, and
   `When it finishes, reply done.` Put the command in a fenced `bash` or `powershell` block with
   the raw URL; never render it inline or as a Markdown link. Do not mention any `twg` command,
   including `doctor`, until the user replies `done`.
4. Only after full installer success, run `doctor` yourself. Never ask the user to run it or
   paste its output, and never reinstall for auth, permission, or command errors.

## Terminal capability

Setup can prompt for agreement consent, required OAuth, and optional Bitbucket configuration.

- Full interactive terminal: the agent can continuously read prompts and send input after the
  process starts.
- Limited terminal: non-TTY, partial TTY, background TTY without continued input, or any
  session where post-start input is unavailable or uncertain.
- Only a full interactive terminal may run installation or interactive `twg setup`,
  `twg login`, and `twg setup bitbucket` outside the sandbox.
- With a limited terminal, do not start an interactive flow; give the OS escape hatch to the
  user, including the plugin argument when recognized.
- Run the installer once in the foreground. If input becomes unavailable, stop only that task
  and follow step 3; do not background, poll, sleep, guess answers or phase, retry, or kill by
  process name. Show only OAuth URLs and codes emitted by the active attempt; never invent or
  reuse them.
- Before requesting approval, explain that the installer downloads `twg`, writes it to the
  standard location, and installs global skills.
- Installer execution requires explicit approval; a setup request alone is not approval.
- Escape hatch means only an OS installer command above, never a `twg ...` command.

## Setup behavior

- Agreement: show the full text and links; relay the user's yes/no response.
- Skills: install globally.
- OAuth: required; show verification URL and user code verbatim; user completes browser auth.
- Upkeep: host scheduler; refreshes OAuth outside restricted agent sandboxes.
- Bitbucket: optional; browser opens token creation; user may skip and configure later.
- Other third-party connections: optional; configure later.
- Secrets: user enters tokens, passwords, API keys, and 2FA/OTP codes. Never request or expose
  them. Never expose OAuth `device_code`.

## Doctor remediation

Use this section only for a pre-existing install or after full installer success.
Run only the reported fix.

- With a full interactive terminal, run auth or setup fixes outside the sandbox.
- Otherwise give the matching interactive remediation command to the user unchanged.
- Run noninteractive fixes, including skill refresh, directly.

- OAuth: `twg login --force`; then `twg doctor`.
- Initial/general setup: `twg setup`; then `twg doctor`.
- Optional Bitbucket: `twg setup bitbucket`; then `twg doctor`.

### Skill refresh

If doctor reports a skill issue or your coding agent cannot see TWG skills, refresh them at
the standard agent skill location:

```text
twg skills install --yes
```

After a skill install or refresh, reload or start a new agent session.

Summarize any remaining issue in one line.

## Continue The Original Request

When `doctor` is healthy, resume and complete the user's original request. Do not stop
at setup or ask the user to choose a new task.

## Things To Try

Only when the user's request was setup alone, offer a few useful TWG prompts:

- Summarize my work during the past month.
- What PRs are waiting on me, and which reviews are stale?
- I'm taking over on-call. Give me incidents, risks, runbooks, and follow-ups.
