# Assess

The goal of Assess is to produce an **environment profile** — enough data about the source MSK environment to make architecture decisions in Plan. Done when cluster count, Kafka version, auth type, networking accessibility, and topic/partition scale are captured, with any red flags surfaced.

## Ambiguities do not block the Assess output

Produce the **full Assess output** in one response — both intake modes use the same section skeleton, only the first section name differs by intake mode:

- **KCP state file intake:** Scan Coverage + Environment Summary + Topic-Level Readiness (when `topics.details[]` populated) + Red Flags checklist + Additional Observations + handoff prompt.
- **Manual `migration-profile.yaml` intake:** **Profile Coverage** + Environment Summary + Topic-Level Readiness (opt-out note — manual profiles do not carry per-topic configs) + Red Flags checklist + Additional Observations + handoff prompt.

Do not stop mid-assessment to ask clarifying questions. Ambiguities and gaps belong in the output itself, not as blockers before it:

- **Ambiguous scan coverage** (e.g., `.schema_registries` empty — could mean no SR or scan didn't run) → report the Scan Coverage row as "Empty / ambiguous" and proceed. Capture the question in Open Questions at the end.
- **Unknown red flags** (e.g., EOS / Kafka Streams usage not detectable from state file) → report the row as "Unknown (needs user confirmation)" and proceed.
- **Null-vs-empty ambiguity** (e.g., connector fields `null` rather than `[]`) → report the row as "Unknown (scan gap)" and proceed.

The user gets a complete picture first, then decides which ambiguities to close. Don't interrupt the flow with mid-stream questions — that forces the user to answer piecemeal before they've seen the full picture.

**Only two exceptions block Assess:** (1) the state file is malformed or unreadable, or (2) the user hasn't yet provided a state file or picked a path. In either case, ask — but every other ambiguity goes into the output and is resolved via Open Questions.

### Foundational-Inputs gate — ask, don't fabricate

Three inputs are load-bearing for the Plan's core recommendations. When one is missing from the source data, ask (route to a re-scan or manual intake) rather than fabricating a value or proceeding on an assumed one:

- **Topics / partitions / scale.** Drives sizing and complexity.
- **Auth posture.** Drives the auth migration path and the IAM pre-migration flag.
- **Networking accessibility** (private/public plus VPC topology). Drives cluster type and networking selection.

This gate does NOT change the never-hedge behavior for peripheral gaps. EOS/transactions, Kafka Streams, connector detail, costs, client inventory, SR version, and IBP stay assume-and-label with an Open Question — they do not block. The discriminator: if the missing input would force the skill to invent a load-bearing recommendation (cluster type, sizing, networking, auth), ask; if it fills a peripheral unknown, assume and label.

The most common foundational gap is a silent KCP scan failure on a private cluster — see the silent-scan-failure fingerprint in the null-vs-empty rule below. A missing topics/scale layer is foundational; do not size or bucket against an assumed count.

### Profile Coverage section — manual-intake equivalent of Scan Coverage

Manual `migration-profile.yaml` intakes use a **Profile Coverage** section header in place of Scan Coverage. The section serves the same role: surface gaps the user should close before Plan. Render as a section header `## Profile Coverage` and list the fields the profile populates vs. the fields it leaves null/absent. For each absent field, name what's missing and what Plan would have used it for. Treat the following as load-bearing fields to call out when absent:

- `clusters[].peak_ingress_mbps` / `peak_egress_mbps` — when null, describe the throughput coverage gap and what Plan sizing falls back to (customer-provided estimate or billing-derived proxy). On MSK Serverless, note that the limitation is by-design rather than scan failure — CloudWatch metrics KCP would normally pull aren't exposed.
- `clusters[].user_topic_count` / `internal_topic_count` — when null, name the gap as a user/internal topic-split gap.
- `clusters[].user_partition_count` / `internal_partition_count` — same pattern as topics.
- `clusters[].acl_count` — when null with `acl_source: iam-policies`, note that Serverless does not support Kafka Admin API (by design, not scan gap).
- `clusters[].storage_mode` — when absent, note as not-indicated-in-manual-profile per the manual-intake default rule below.
- `connectors.*` — when present but zero, note distinctly from absent fields.
- `schema_registry.*` — when `type: none`, note as schemaless source.

The Profile Coverage section is the manual-intake equivalent of Scan Coverage and is required on every manual-intake Assess output. Do not fold this content into the Environment Summary preamble — emit it as a discrete `## Profile Coverage` heading so downstream readers (and downstream Plan stage consumers) can locate the coverage surface by header.

## State File Audit — run first when a KCP state file is provided

**Run on receipt, no permission prompt.** When the user provides a state file path, begin the audit immediately. Do not present the audit table as a menu, do not ask "Want me to run these myself, or would you prefer to run them?", do not stage the queries as a proposal. jq queries against a file the user just handed over are read-only parsing and auto-run per the command-execution principle in SKILL.md. The audit table below is the skill's internal reference for what to check, not a user-facing choice.

Before producing any environment summary, run this scan-coverage audit. This forces every Assess session to read the state file the same way and prevents missing data that's present (e.g., skipping region-level fields like `costs` because you went straight to per-cluster details). Do not skim; run the queries.

**Audit checklist.** For each KCP scan, check whether it ran by testing the corresponding state file path. Use `jq` for each query (per the parsing directive below). Do not use inline Python.

| Scan | jq path to test | If populated | If empty / missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kcp discover` | `.regions[].clusters[] \| .name` | Clusters enumerated — proceed | State file effectively empty; reject and request a re-scan starting at `kcp discover` |
| `kcp scan clusters` | `.regions[].clusters[] \| .kafka_admin_client_information.topics.details \| length` | Topics, partitions, ACLs, auth, Kafka version captured per cluster | If topics empty WHILE `msk_cluster_config` is populated → the deep scan did not complete (NOT zero topics), almost always private-network unreachability. KCP reports success silently. Topics/scale is foundational — do not assume; route to re-scan-from-VPC or manual intake. |
| `kcp scan schema-registry` | `.schema_registries \| length` | SR inventory captured | Either no SR exists in the environment OR scan wasn't run — clarify with the user. Don't assume schemaless. |
| `kcp scan client-inventory` | `.regions[].clusters[] \| .discovered_clients \| length` | Producers/consumers discovered | Gap — needed for Switchover planning. Acknowledge the gap, recommend re-running with broker-log access (usually S3) before Switchover. |
| `kcp report costs` | `.regions[] \| .costs.results \| length` | AWS cost breakdown available per region | Gap — business-case data missing. Optional for migration mechanics but surface to the user. |
| `kcp report metrics` | `.regions[].clusters[] \| .metrics.results \| length` | CloudWatch throughput and storage metrics available | Gap — Plan sizing will be estimated rather than measured. Flag. |

**Always report audit results to the user before summarizing the environment.** Format the report as a "Scan Coverage" section showing which scans ran, which didn't, and what the missing ones would add. This surfaces gaps the user needs to close before Plan.

**Data grounding — inline parenthetical citations are required on every Environment Summary fact.** Every numeric or categorical claim in the Environment Summary (cluster count, brokers, instance type, Kafka version, topic/partition counts, throughput, auth, networking, SR, connectors, costs, drivers) carries an inline parenthetical citation to its source path at first use. Citing the field path only in the separate Scan Coverage table or in the Red Flags evidence column does not satisfy this — the user needs to verify each fact in place without cross-referencing another table.

Citation path style depends on intake mode:

- **KCP state file:** `jq`-style path into the JSON (e.g., `regions[0].clusters[].aws_client_information.msk_cluster_config.Provisioned.BrokerNodeGroupInfo.InstanceType`).
- **Manual `migration-profile.yaml`:** YAML key path from the top of the file (e.g., `clusters[0].broker_count`, `source.kafka_version`, `schema_registry.subject_count`).

When a field is missing, say so explicitly — don't fabricate. The same inline-citation rule applies in Plan (`references/plan.md` "Plan Doc Conventions — cite every number"); this paragraph applies the same discipline upstream in Assess so the Environment Summary the user sees is verifiable in place.

**Full URLs in doc citations — strict.** Per the SKILL.md "Full URLs in citation link text" rule, every doc citation in Assess output must render the full URL visibly in the rendered text. Filename-shorthand link text like `[cluster-types.md](https://...)` or `[migrate-cc.md](https://...)` is forbidden — readers viewing the Assess output in plaintext (printed, Slack, non-rendering viewer) see only the filename with no way to navigate. Use bare URLs (`https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/clusters/cluster-types.md`), URL-as-link-text, or short descriptive label + bare URL in surrounding prose. Bare bracketed shorthand like `([cluster-types.html])` and bare filename mentions in prose ("per private-networking.html") are also forbidden. The href being correct is not sufficient — the URL itself must be visible. (URLs are shown here in `.md` source form; emit each to the user as `.html` — swap the extension — per the SKILL.md fetch/cite rule.)

**Match metric labels loosely, and verify the lookup returned data.** KCP metric labels can change between versions, so do NOT require an exact full-label match. Match on the metric substring and prefer the `Cluster Aggregate` variant when present (it gives the cluster-wide value for sizing; `Broker Aggregate` is per-broker and doesn't usefully sum to a cluster total):

- ingress: a result whose `.Label` contains `BytesInPerSec` (prefer one also containing `Cluster Aggregate`)
- egress: `.Label` contains `BytesOutPerSec`
- tiered volume: `.Label` contains `TotalRemoteStorageUsage`
- partitions: `.Label` contains `PartitionCount`

Example: `.metrics.results[] | select(.Label | test("BytesInPerSec"))` rather than `select(.Label == "Cluster Aggregate - BytesInPerSec")`.

**Verify non-empty before using.** After each lookup, confirm the result is non-empty. If a metric you expected (the scan reports metrics ran) returns empty, treat it as a scan/parse gap — foundational throughput is missing, so ask / flag per the Foundational-Inputs gate. Never let an empty lookup flow through as zero traffic / "no traffic." This extends the silent-scan-failure discipline to the metric layer.

Convert bytes/sec values to MBps using 1 MB = 1,048,576 bytes (binary).

**Similar-cluster bucketing.** When 2+ clusters are substantially identical on the load-bearing dimensions — instance type, broker count, auth set, networking (accessibility + topology), Kafka version, scale band (topic/partition order of magnitude and throughput band), and tiered-storage flag — render them as one **"similar clusters" bucket** instead of repeating near-duplicate rows. Clusters that differ on any load-bearing dimension stay itemized (or form their own bucket). Sizing math and Topic-Level Readiness still run per cluster underneath; the bucket carries the shared decisions once and notes any per-member deltas. Full per-cluster detail remains available on request.

Render verbatim:

```
### Similar clusters: <N> clusters, identical profile
Members: `cluster-a`, `cluster-b`, `cluster-c`, … (<N> total)
Shared profile: <brokers>×<instance>, Kafka <version>, ~<topics> topics / ~<partitions> partitions, auth <set>, networking <accessibility>/<topology>, tiered <yes/no>.
Shared decisions: cluster type <X>, networking <Y>, switchover <Z>, auth <A>.
Per-member deltas: <none | list e.g. "cluster-b: 2× partitions">.
```

Itemize any cluster not in a bucket using the standard per-cluster format.

**Topic and partition count convention.** Always report topic and partition counts as `user + internal = total` when the split is available (e.g., "1,124 user + 53 internal = 1,177 total topics; 4,058 user + 53 internal = 4,111 total partitions"). Never report only one of the three without labeling which it is. Internal topics don't migrate — they're recreated by Kafka, Connect, or Streams on the destination — but knowing both counts is useful for environment understanding.

**Cost data — enumerate line items, do not compute sums or totals.** Cost data in `regions[0].costs.results[].Groups[]` is a list of line items (usage type + amount). Enumerate these as a table or list with usage-type label, amount, and which discovered cluster (if any) the line item maps to. **Do NOT compute or report:**

- A total annual spend across all line items
- A "discovered-cluster broker spend" or "compute baseline" computed as a sum across multiple line items
- A percentage of total spend that's unaccounted-for
- Any other derived arithmetic that sums or divides across line items

Reason: derived totals are a recurring error mode. The sum looks plausible but is wrong, and a single wrong number undermines confidence in the Row 16 reasoning that depends on the cost evidence. Row 16's materiality threshold is **per-line-item** by design ("a line item on par with or larger than one of the scanned clusters is material") — comparing each unmapped line item against discovered-cluster line items individually preserves the evidence chain without arithmetic risk.

Acceptable framing: name the unmapped line item, name a discovered-cluster line item, compare them directly. "Unmapped line item X at $A/yr is N× the discovered cluster Y's line item ($B/yr) — material."

Avoid framings that sum across line items: "Total spend is $T", "$U of $T is unaccounted-for (P%)", "Discovered compute = $D; unaccounted = $U; ratio R×".

If the user explicitly asks for a total, compute it then with the disclaimer that line items may not all add cleanly (rounding, line items spanning multiple services). Otherwise enumerate and stop.

Source fields per intake type:
- **KCP state file:** `.topics.summary.topics` (user), `.topics.summary.internal_topics` (internal), `.topics.summary.total_partitions` (user), `.topics.summary.total_internal_partitions` (internal). Always available.
- **Manual `migration-profile.yaml`:** `user_topic_count` / `internal_topic_count` (topics) and `user_partition_count` / `internal_partition_count` (partitions). These are optional fields. When populated, apply the convention. When `null`, fall back to the aggregate `topic_count` / `partition_count_pre_replication` and label them as totals — e.g., "1,177 total topics (user/internal split not captured in manual profile)". Do NOT fabricate a split. Note the gap in `known_gaps` so a follow-up scan can fill it later.

## Intake Path Selection

Pick the richest path available.

### KCP deep scan

**First mention of KCP in a conversation requires an introduction.** Don't assume the user knows what KCP is. Briefly explain: KCP is Confluent's open-source migration tool ([github.com/confluentinc/kcp](https://github.com/confluentinc/kcp)) for assessing AWS MSK environments and generating migration assets for Confluent Cloud.

Use when the KCP CLI is installed (`kcp --version`) and the user has AWS credentials for the source account.

**Trust KCP; don't front-load questions the scan will answer.** When the user chooses KCP, walk them through the commands in sequence. Ask each command's specific preconditions right before running that command, not upfront as generic intake. The only upfront prereq checks are:

1. KCP installed (`kcp --version` or `kcp version`)
2. AWS credentials available for the source account (read access to MSK, EC2, CloudWatch, Cost Explorer)

Do NOT ask about regions, auth types, Schema Registry type, cluster count, networking topology, topic counts, or any other environment detail before scanning — the scan reveals these. Network reachability (private MSK requires broker line-of-sight for the deep cluster scan) is a precondition for `kcp scan clusters`; raise it at that step, not as pre-scan intake. The point of the KCP path is to let the tool discover the environment, not to have the user describe it manually before running it.

**Required sequence to produce a data-rich state file.** Run in order. Each command appends to the same state file (typically `kcp-state.json`). Verify exact flags against `kcp <cmd> --help` or the [repo](https://github.com/confluentinc/kcp) — flags change between versions.

| # | Command | Essential? | What It Adds to the State File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `kcp discover` | **Required** | Cluster ARNs, metadata per region |
| 2 | `kcp scan clusters` | **Required** | Topics, partitions, ACLs, auth, Kafka version, broker configs per cluster. Requires Kafka auth credentials (typically in `cluster-credentials.yaml`). |
| 3 | `kcp scan schema-registry` | **Required if any SR exists** | Subjects, versions, compatibility. Supports Confluent SR and AWS Glue (via `--sr-type=glue`). |
| 4 | `kcp scan client-inventory` | **Recommended (most migrations can skip)** | Producers and consumers discovered from broker logs. Requires log access (typically S3). Skip is fine for most migrations; run it for richer client-level detail. |
| 5 | `kcp report metrics` | **Required for sizing** | CloudWatch peak throughput, storage utilization per cluster. Feeds Plan-stage sizing. |
| 6 | `kcp report costs` | Optional (business case) | AWS Cost Explorer breakdown. Nice for a business case; not required for migration mechanics. |

**Minimum for Plan decisions:** steps 1, 2, 3 (if SR exists), and 5.
**Full business case:** all six. Step 4 (client inventory) is optional — most migrations can proceed without it; run it for richer client-level detail.

**Present the full 6-step sequence first, before any prereq check or scan step.** When the user picks the KCP path, the skill's next response must show the sequence table above so the user sees the complete map of what's ahead. Then invite them to start — don't jump straight to `kcp version` checks or run any command. Only after the user is ready do you begin step 1.

Once the user is ready, walk through the sequence one step at a time. For each scan command: state what's about to happen, ask only the precondition that command needs, present the command, and ask the user whether they want to run it themselves (paste output back) or have the skill run it. Per the command-execution principle in SKILL.md, user approval is required before the skill runs anything. Concretely:

- Before step 1 (`kcp discover`): ask which AWS region(s) to sweep. If the user doesn't know, note that `kcp discover` can scan multiple or all regions.
- Before step 2 (`kcp scan clusters`): ask about Kafka auth credentials per cluster. Help the user build `cluster-credentials.yaml` if needed. **Also confirm network reachability** — `kcp scan clusters` needs broker-protocol access to each cluster. If MSK is private, the scan host must be inside the VPC, VPN-connected, or reachable via Direct Connect. `kcp discover` works from anywhere (AWS APIs); `kcp scan clusters` needs Kafka-protocol reachability.
- Before step 3 (`kcp scan schema-registry`): the cluster scan output will indicate whether SR is in use. If yes, confirm SR type (Confluent or Glue) — usually visible from the config or the user can confirm.
- Before step 4 (`kcp scan client-inventory`): ask if broker logs are accessible (typically S3). If not, skip and record the gap.
- Steps 5 and 6: no preconditions — just run.

Output: `kcp-state.json` — the canonical environment artifact that feeds Plan, Provision, Migrate, and asset-generation stages.

**Parsing the state file.** Use `jq` for structured queries and the Read tool for full-file inspection. Do NOT use inline Python (`python3 <<EOF ... EOF`) or Node (`node -e ...`) to parse state files. Reasons: (1) KCP state files contain many optional fields that may be null, and Python scripts crash on `len()`/iteration against null without defensive coding every script would need; (2) inline interpreters are slow and noisy in Claude Code; (3) `jq` handles null fields cleanly and is the right tool for JSON query. jq queries against a state file the user provided are read-only parsing — auto-run them per the command-execution principle in SKILL.md, no approval prompt.

**Run each `jq` query as its own Bash tool call.** Per the one-command-per-Bash-call principle in SKILL.md (Skill Conduct), issue each audit query as a separate Bash invocation rather than batching into a compound shell command (variable assignment + chained `jq` calls). Applies to the 6-scan coverage audit and any multi-query sequence in Assess.

**Fetching docs.** Same rule applies to live docs: use `WebFetch`, not `curl | python3` or heredoc scripts that strip HTML. `WebFetch` handles HTML→markdown and targeted extraction in one call. See SKILL.md "Fetch tool" directive for the full rule.

### Manual intake

Use when KCP is not available (restricted AWS account, pre-engagement intake, customer doesn't have credentials to run KCP).

**Hybrid fallback when the deep scan silently failed.** When `kcp discover` succeeded (`msk_cluster_config` populated) but `kcp scan clusters` silently skipped the cluster (topics empty — see the silent-scan-failure fingerprint above), do NOT re-ask for everything. Keep what discover already captured from the AWS APIs: networking, auth, instance type, Kafka version, throughput from metrics, connectors. Collect only the missing Kafka-protocol layer through manual intake — topics, partitions, ACLs, per-topic configs. Pre-fill the `migration-profile.yaml` from the discover data and walk the user only through the gap.

**Write the YAML stub on the first turn — do not defer to a second turn after the user answers all 11 groups.** On turn 1, populate `migration-profile.yaml` with whatever facts the user has already provided in their opening message, leave every other field as `null` (and every per-cluster list as the user-stated count of clusters with all per-cluster fields null), and record any user-declared gaps in `known_gaps[]` with field path + reason. Then ask the intake questions in the same response. As the user answers across subsequent turns, update the existing YAML file in place — do not wait until intake is complete to write the file. The YAML is the artifact downstream stages consume; a missing file blocks every downstream check.

- Copy `assets/migration-profile.yaml` to the user's working directory on turn 1. Populate top-level keys `source` (platform, cloud_provider, region from the user's message; other fields null) and `clusters` (one stub entry per cluster the user stated, with `name: null` and all per-cluster fields null pending intake group 2). Record `known_gaps[]` entries for any field the user explicitly flagged as unknown in their opening message (e.g., throughput, ACL count) so the gap survives the intake conversation. **`clusters[].ibp_version` is a common gap** — many users don't track `inter.broker.protocol` separately from the Kafka binary version. If Q9 leaves `ibp_version` null, append `clusters[<name>].ibp_version` to `known_gaps[]` so Red Flags Row 2 can flag it as Unknown (scan gap) and the Plan can carry it as an Open Question to the source-cluster owner.
- Walk the user through the 11 intake question groups below in the same turn, framing the stub as the starting point and the questions as the path to fill it in.
- As the user answers in later turns, update the stub in place. Use `Edit` to modify the existing YAML — do not rewrite from scratch.
- Output: populated `migration-profile.yaml`. Functionally equivalent to a KCP state file for downstream stages, but less detailed.

## Conversational Intake Questions (11 groups)

Walk these in order during manual intake. Record answers in the environment profile.

1. **Platform.** MSK Provisioned or MSK Serverless? AWS region(s)? Single-cluster or multi-cluster?
2. **Cluster topology.** Broker count, instance type (Provisioned), broker AZ distribution. Cross-region replication in place?
3. **Scale.** Peak ingress MBps, peak egress MBps, topic count, partition count (pre-replication), replication factor.
4. **Auth.** SASL/SCRAM, mTLS, AWS IAM, Unauthenticated — which is in use? Mixed within the cluster or per-cluster?
5. **Networking.** Private (VPC-internal only) or public? If private, VPC topology: single-VPC, hub-and-spoke, direct VPC peering, Transit Gateway?
6. **ACLs.** Rough ACL count. Kafka ACLs, MSK IAM policies, or both?
7. **Schema Registry.** Confluent SR (which version?), AWS Glue, Karapace, or none? Approximate subject count.
8. **Connectors.** MSK Connect managed connectors? Self-managed Connect clusters? Connector types (which source/sink systems)?
9. **Kafka version + IBP.** Source Kafka version, and has `inter.broker.protocol` (IBP) been bumped to meet CL's IBP floor? (Some customers leave IBP at an older value after a Kafka upgrade — CL requires a minimum IBP on the source even when the binary version is much newer.) The CL migration-use-case **product-version** floor is Kafka 2.4.0+ / CP 5.4.0+. The **IBP floor is a separate general requirement, not relaxed by the migration exception** — fetch the current IBP value live from the [CL source requirements doc](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/multi-cloud/cluster-linking/index.md); do not assume it equals the 2.4.0 product floor. Record both values: `clusters[].kafka_version` and `clusters[].ibp_version`. If the user doesn't know IBP, leave it null and flag in `known_gaps[]`.
10. **Costs.** Rough monthly MSK spend (can pull via KCP `report costs` in Path B).
11. **Migration drivers.** Why migrate? What's the timeline? Any hard cutover constraint (peak season, compliance deadline)?

If the user can't answer a question, flag it as a known gap. Don't fabricate.

## Topic-Level Readiness

Between the Environment Summary and the Red Flags checklist, the Assess output emits a **Topic-Level Readiness** section that classifies user topics into four migration-readiness buckets. This surfaces a question the cluster-level summary cannot answer on its own: of the user topics on this cluster, how many actually move cleanly through Cluster Linking, how many need a config change first, and how many need code or design work?

**Trigger.** Produce the section whenever a KCP state file is provided AND `topics.details[]` is populated. Skip with an explicit opt-out note when running off a manual `migration-profile.yaml` profile (manual profiles do not carry per-topic broker configs — bucketing is not derivable).

### Bucketing rules

Classify each user topic into one of four buckets, evaluated per topic in this order:

- **Skip (don't migrate).** Internal Kafka topics (`__consumer_offsets`, `__transaction_state`, `__amazon_msk_canary`). Connect framework triads (naked or prefixed `connect-offsets` / `connect-status` / `connect-configs`). MM2 artifacts (`mm2-*`, `*.checkpoints.internal`, `mm2-offset-syncs`). Kafka Streams artifacts (`*-changelog`, `*-repartition`). Pattern matching reuses the Row 15 regex set from the Red Flags checklist. These do not migrate via CL and are recreated by Kafka, Connect, or Streams on the destination.

- **Manual work.** Topics with characteristics CL cannot transfer or that require code or design work before migration:
  - `remote.storage.enable: true` (tiered storage; historical data does not transfer via CL — cross-reference Historical Data Handling in Plan).
  - `cleanup.policy: compact,delete` or `delete,compact` (mixed policy; CC support varies by cluster type — defer to Confluent account team if mixed-policy support is ambiguous).
  - `replication_factor` other than 3 (CC enforces RF=3 on Standard/Enterprise — topic creation will fail unaltered; recreate at RF=3 on target).
  - `max.message.bytes` above the CC ceiling for the target cluster type (fetched live from cluster-types.html).
  - `min.insync.replicas` outside CC's allowed range for the target cluster type.
  - Topics with associated ACLs whose pattern type or operation set has no direct CC RBAC equivalent (cite the Row 9 path when triggered).

- **Needs config.** Topics that migrate but need a config adjustment first. Each rule has an **explicit numeric threshold** — compute the comparison for every topic before summarizing the bucket. Vague "non-default" language is not a license to skip the comparison; if the threshold isn't computed per-topic, the bucket count is wrong. All CC defaults and limits in these rules route to one source: the CC per-topic config reference at [topics/manage.md](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/topics/manage.md), fetched as the `.md` variant per the Sources of Truth fetch rule. Verify the thresholds against that single fetch. Do not cache these numbers inline, and do not route them to cluster-types.html, which does not carry per-topic config defaults.
  - `retention.ms` > 604800000 (CC default 7 days = 604800000 ms, editable). Topics with longer retention preserve the longer value only with an explicit override at topic creation.
  - `retention.bytes` set to a finite non-default value (CC default -1 / unlimited, editable). A finite source value carries over only with an explicit override at topic creation.
  - `segment.bytes` below 52428800 (50 MiB) or above 1073741824 (1 GiB). That is CC's allowed range; the CC default is 104857600 (100 MiB). A source value outside the range is a hard failure that CC rejects or clamps at topic creation, so flag it. A non-default value inside the range (including the common 1073741824 source default carried over from MSK) sets cleanly at topic creation and does not land here on its own.
  - `compression.type` set to anything other than `producer` (CC default is `producer`; preserving customer-specific compression — `lz4`, `zstd`, `gzip`, `snappy` — requires an explicit override at topic creation).
  - `message.timestamp.type` set to `LogAppendTime` (CC default is `CreateTime`; behavioral change post-migration that consumers may depend on).
  - `unclean.leader.election.enable` set to `true` (CC default is `false`; availability vs. consistency tradeoff to confirm).

- **Moves cleanly.** Everything else. Default bucket when no Skip / Manual / Needs config rule above triggers.

### Bucket-count discipline — verify before emitting

Inconsistent bucket counts or skipped rule checks lose customer trust faster than any other issue in the Assess output. Before emitting the Topic-Level Readiness section, verify each of the following:

1. **Classify per-topic first, summarize second.** For each user topic in `kafka_admin_client_information.topics.details[]`, iterate through the bucket rules in order (Skip → Manual → Needs config → Moves cleanly). Place the topic in the FIRST bucket whose rule fires. Do not summarize the bucket counts before classifying every topic individually.

2. **Needs config requires per-topic threshold evaluation.** Reporting `Needs config: 0` is only valid after evaluating every topic against every Needs-config threshold (retention.ms > 604800000, compression.type != producer, etc.). If the per-topic comparison wasn't computed, the count is unverified — re-run the classification before emitting.

3. **Counts must equal enumerated-list length.** When the rendered output names a Skip count ("Skip bucket: N topics excluded"), N must equal the literal count of topics enumerated in the list that follows. If the introductory narrative pre-states a count, it must match the enumeration. Derive the count from the enumeration, not the other way around.

4. **Sum check — migrate buckets vs. user-topic denominator.** Moves cleanly + Needs config + Manual work = the user-topic count actually in migrate scope. The Skip bucket counts framework-managed topics (Connect coordination triads, MM2 artifacts, Streams changelogs) plus any Kafka internals the runner observes in `topics.details[]` — it is reported separately and is NOT part of the migrate-scope sum. State both checks inline: `migrate-scope total = X` (matches user_topic_count from Source Environment minus Skip-bucket topics that originated from user_topic_count), and `Skip total = Y`. If either count contradicts an enumeration that follows, re-classify before emitting.

5. **No topic in multiple buckets.** Each topic in `topics.details[]` belongs to exactly one bucket — the first rule that fires per the order above wins.

6. **Self-check before emit.** State the bucket counts inline in this form: "Moves cleanly: A + Needs config: B + Manual work: C = M migrate-scope topics; Skip: D framework-managed/internal topics reported separately." If the migrate-scope sum doesn't match the user-topic total reported in the Source Environment cluster table (minus any Skip-bucket topics drawn from user_topic_count), do not emit the section until classifications are corrected. The narrative must not pre-state a count that contradicts the enumeration.

7. **Bucket percentages use migrate-scope as denominator, not user_topic_count.** For the three migrate buckets (Moves cleanly, Needs config, Manual work), the percentage is `bucket_count ÷ migrate_scope_total × 100`, where `migrate_scope_total = user_topic_count − Skip-bucket-topics-drawn-from-user-count`. Schema coverage is the exception — it uses `user_topic_count` per the rule in the next section, because schemas are an application-side property of every topic the application owns. Bucket percentages are about migration behavior; topics that don't migrate (Skip) don't belong in the denominator. Two consequences worth restating in the output to avoid ambiguity:
   - On a cluster where 6 of 10 user topics are Skip-bucket framework topics (e.g., Connect triad + Debezium heartbeats), migrate-scope is 4, and "Moves cleanly: 4 (100%)" is correct. "Moves cleanly: 4 (40%)" using user_topic_count would falsely read as "60% of cluster has migration friction" when the friction is actually zero — the other 6 simply don't migrate.
   - State `migrate-scope = N` explicitly before the bucket list so the reader sees the denominator the percentages rest on. Generic shape: *"On `<cluster-name>`: U user topics (`topics.summary.topics`). Of these, S land in Skip-from-user-count (e.g., Connect framework triad + Debezium heartbeats), so **migrate-scope = U−S**. Bucketed by migration readiness: Moves cleanly: A (A÷(U−S)%), Needs config: B (B÷(U−S)%), Manual work: C (C÷(U−S)%)."*

8. **Scope is per-cluster.** Render Topic-Level Readiness per cluster — bucket counts, percentages, migrate-scope total, sum check, Skip composition all reported within each cluster's section. Do NOT default to a cross-cluster aggregate ("Moves cleanly: 8 (47%)" across both clusters). Migration is cluster-by-cluster: switchover groups are per cluster, pre-migration workstream items are per cluster, the user's mental model of "what needs to happen for cluster X" is per cluster. A cross-cluster summary line at the end of the section is acceptable ("Migrate-scope total across both clusters: 11; Skip total: 10") but does not replace per-cluster reporting. Mixing scopes within a single output (per-cluster on one cluster, cross-cluster aggregate on another) is not acceptable — pick per-cluster and stay per-cluster.

### Schema coverage (derived metric)

Below the bucket counts, report schema coverage: "X of Y user topics have schemas registered (Z%)" computed by joining `topics.details[].name` against `schema_registries[].subjects[].name` using the TopicNameStrategy convention (`<topic>-value` and `<topic>-key` suffix stripping). Cite the join logic and note the limitation: "TopicNameStrategy assumed; coverage % is approximate when source uses TopicRecordNameStrategy or RecordNameStrategy. KCP does not capture subject naming strategy."

**Denominator rule.** Y is the **user topic count** — `topics.summary.topics` per cluster, summed across clusters when reporting a cross-cluster figure. Do NOT subtract Skip-bucket topics (Connect framework triads, MM2 artifacts, Streams changelogs, Debezium heartbeats) from the denominator. Skip-bucket topics are framework-managed and have no application-side schemas, but they count toward the user-topic universe by KCP's accounting and must stay in Y so coverage % is comparable across migrations. The numerator X is the count of user topics with a matching subject under the join convention. When reporting per-cluster coverage, use that cluster's `topics.summary.topics`; when reporting cross-cluster, sum `topics.summary.topics` across all clusters in scope. Do not switch between migrate-scope and user-scope denominators within a single Assess output.

### Output format (render verbatim)

```
## Topic-Level Readiness

Of 142 user topics on `prod-kafka-east` (internal topics excluded per the Skip
bucket; classification logic below), bucketed by migration readiness:

- **Moves cleanly: 118 (83%).** Broker configs map 1:1 to CC defaults for the
  recommended Enterprise target. Cluster Linking transfers these topics with
  no pre-migration config work.
- **Needs config: 19 (13%).** Migrate via CL but require a config change on
  the target before or at topic creation. Per-topic threshold evaluation:
  `retention.ms` > 604800000 on 14 topics (e.g., `audit-events` at 2592000000
  = 30 days; `compliance-logs` at 7776000000 = 90 days); `compression.type`
  != `producer` on 3 topics (set to `lz4`); `unclean.leader.election.enable`
  = `true` on 2 topics. Total 19 distinct topics — each topic counted once
  even when multiple thresholds trip; the first rule that fires wins.
- **Manual work: 5 (4%).** Require code or design work before migration:
  - `internal-metrics`: replication_factor=2 (CC requires RF=3 on Enterprise per cluster-types.html).
    Recreate at RF=3 on target. Consumer offset behavior on recreate is an operational consideration for your IT team.
  - `audit-events-tiered`: remote.storage.enable=true (tiered storage enabled).
    See "Historical Data Handling" section in Plan for the backfill decision.
    Note: per-topic remote storage size is not available from KCP scan data
    (KCP captures only cluster-aggregate `TotalRemoteStorageUsage`).
  - `dlq-payments`, `dlq-orders`, `dlq-shipments`: ACL pattern type
    PREFIXED with custom Deny rules (3 topics). CC RBAC has no direct
    equivalent for Deny semantics; redesign as Allow-only RBAC bindings before migration.

**Sum check.** 118 + 19 + 5 = 142 user topics (matches the Source Environment cluster table). Skip bucket reports 17 internal/framework topics separately; Skip topics are excluded from the user-topic denominator by definition.

**Schema coverage:** 67 of 142 user topics have schemas registered in
Confluent SR (47%), assuming TopicNameStrategy subject naming. Coverage is
approximate when source uses TopicRecordNameStrategy or RecordNameStrategy
— KCP does not capture the subject naming strategy.

**Skip bucket: 17 topics** excluded as Kafka internals or framework
coordination topics. Composition (count derived from enumeration, sums
to 17):

- 3 Kafka internals: `__consumer_offsets`, `__transaction_state`, `__amazon_msk_canary`.
- 3 Connect framework triads: `connect-offsets-cdc`, `connect-status-cdc`, `connect-configs-cdc`.
- 6 MM2 artifacts: 4× `mm2-offsets-*` topics + 2× `*.checkpoints.internal` topics.
- 5 Streams changelog topics: `app-store-changelog-0` through `app-store-changelog-4`.

These do not migrate via CL and are recreated by Kafka, Connect, or
Streams on the destination. The narrative Skip count (17) and the
enumeration above must agree — derive the count from the enumeration,
not the other way around.

**Classification logic.** See assess.md "Topic-Level Readiness bucketing
rules" for the full rule set, including which broker configs trigger each
bucket. All rules trace to broker-side topic configs in
`.kafka_admin_client_information.topics.details[].configurations` plus
live-fetched CC config ceilings from cluster-types.html.
```

For manual-profile intakes (no `topics.details[]` available), render this opt-out note in place of the bucket counts:

```
## Topic-Level Readiness

Per-topic bucketing is not available for this assessment — manual profile
does not carry per-topic broker configs in the profile schema. Topic-level
classification requires a KCP state file with `topics.details[]` populated.

To enable bucketing, re-run with a KCP scan when AWS credentials become
available, or capture the per-topic configs manually for the topics most
likely to need work (typically: any topic with `remote.storage.enable=true`,
non-default `cleanup.policy`, `replication_factor != 3`, or
`unclean.leader.election.enable=true`).
```

### KCP data feasibility — what's covered and what isn't

What KCP gives, no scanning changes needed:
- All broker-side topic configs in `topics.details[].configurations` (every key seen in production state files, including `remote.storage.enable`, `cleanup.policy`, `retention.*`, `min.insync.replicas`, `max.message.bytes`, etc.).
- `replication_factor` and `partitions` per topic.
- ACL list with `ResourceType` / `ResourceName` / `PatternType` / `Operation` / `Permission` — joinable to topics by ResourceName for the "non-standard ACL pattern" sub-check.
- Schema Registry `subjects[].name` for the TopicNameStrategy join.

What KCP doesn't give at topic level (call out as limitations in the rendered output):
- **Per-topic throughput.** CloudWatch BytesInPerSec / BytesOutPerSec per topic exists as an AWS metric but KCP only pulls Cluster Aggregate. The skill cannot rank topics by throughput from current state data — do not claim it.
- **Client-side characteristics.** Custom partitioner, custom serializers, custom interceptors, EOS / transactions usage all live in client code, not on brokers. The skill cannot detect these from any state file — Manual-bucket entries should only flag broker-observable conditions; client-side custom code surfaces as Open Questions, not as Manual-bucket entries.
- **Subject naming strategy.** KCP captures subject names but not the strategy producers use to register schemas. Schema coverage % is approximate when source uses non-default strategies; flag this explicitly.
- **Per-topic consumer apps.** `discovered_clients[]` has a `topic` field, so this IS derivable from KCP IF `kcp scan client-inventory` ran. When clients exist, the skill can cite producer/consumer counts per topic; when not, Manual-bucket reasons referencing consumers fall back to "consumer impact unknown — closes after `kcp scan client-inventory`."

### Cross-references

Topic-Level Readiness rolls forward into Plan in two places:
- **Manual-bucket entries** roll into Pre-Migration Workstream as discrete items (e.g., "Recreate `internal-metrics` at RF=3 on target," "Redesign Deny ACLs as Allow-only RBAC for `dlq-*` topics").
- **Needs-config entries** roll into the connector / topic-provisioning step in `kcp create-asset` so the generated topic configs reflect the target ceilings.
- **Manual-bucket topics involving tiered storage** cross-reference the **Historical Data Handling** section in Plan (B4) — the section that decides whether CL backfills history at all.

## Red Flags — required checklist plus judgment-based additions

Red flags are **structural migration concerns** — things that change the migration plan by blocking a path, adding pre-migration work, forcing cluster type escalation, or requiring special handling at Switchover. They are NOT the same as environment observations (scale, characteristics, topology facts) which belong in the Environment Summary.

**Distinguishing red flag vs. environment observation:**

| Is it a red flag? | Examples |
|---|---|
| Yes — structural migration concern | IAM auth blocks Zero-Cut; Kafka version below CL floor; tiered storage won't transfer via CL; EOS not supported on CL |
| No — environment observation (cover in Summary) | Private networking; cluster size; fan-out ratio; broker instance type; topic count distribution |

Assess output contains two finding sections: **Red Flags** (required checklist) and **Additional Observations** (judgment-based findings).

### Red Flags — required checklist, walk in order

Every Assess output walks these 17 rows **in order**, numbered 1–17, reporting one of three statuses for each:

- **Triggered** — condition is present; include specific evidence (which cluster, what value).
- **Not triggered** — condition is absent; include the row with "Not triggered" so the user sees it was checked.
- **Unknown** — scan gap prevents determination; include with "Unknown (scan gap)" and note what's needed to close.

Do NOT reorder, merge, rename, or skip rows. Additional color about a triggered item goes in the evidence, not as a new row.

**Null vs. empty for admin-scan fields — disambiguate using `topics.details`.** In the state file, `acls`, `connectors` (from MSK Connect side under `aws_client_information`), and `self_managed_connectors` are slices that KCP initializes as `nil` and appends to. On a successful scan that found zero entries, nothing is appended and the nil slice marshals to `null`. `null` does not, by itself, mean the scan didn't run.

Disambiguate per cluster using `.kafka_admin_client_information.topics.details` as the signal:

- **Topics populated AND cluster is PROVISIONED** → the admin scan succeeded. Apply per-row logic:
  - **Row 9 (ACLs):** `acls: null` means **zero ACLs found**. Row 9 applies if IAM is also enabled.
  - **Row 6 (MSK Connect):** `connectors: null` means zero MSK Connect connectors found. Row 6 = Not triggered.
  - **Row 7 (self-managed Connect):** `self_managed_connectors: null` is NOT decisive on its own. KCP's self-managed Connect scanner only matches the literal topic name `connect-configs`, so prefixed worker fleets (`connect-configs-cdc`, `connect-configs-events`, etc.) are invisible to it. Row 7's status is governed by the Row 15 cross-reference, not by this field. **If Row 15 identifies a Connect framework triad (naked `connect-offsets`/`connect-status`/`connect-configs` OR a prefixed triad), Row 7 = Triggered.** If Row 15 finds no triad, Row 7 = Not triggered. Do NOT report Row 7 as "Unknown (scan gap)" when topics are populated — the scan ran; the scanner is just blind to prefixed fleets.
- **Topics populated AND cluster is SERVERLESS** → KCP intentionally skips ACL scanning on serverless. `acls: null` is expected. Note as a KCP limitation, not a scan gap. **Authz migration still applies when IAM is enabled.** Serverless authorization lives in IAM policies, not Kafka ACLs — but the IAM-policy → CC RBAC translation is the same migration step. When Row 3 is Triggered on a Serverless cluster, surface `kcp create-asset migrate-acls iam` as the authz migration path in the Row 9 evidence (or in the commands-the-skill-would-propose section), independent of Row 9 itself being N/A. Do not defer this to "Plan-stage decision" without naming the command.
- **Topics null or empty** → the cluster admin scan didn't run successfully (cluster not in credentials file, or scan errored mid-flight). All downstream admin fields are scan gaps, not confirmed zeros. Rows 6, 7, 9 report **Unknown (scan gap)**.
- **Silent-scan-failure fingerprint: topics empty + `msk_cluster_config` populated.** When `kafka_admin_client_information.topics.details` is empty across all clusters WHILE `aws_client_information.msk_cluster_config` is populated (networking, auth, instance type, Kafka version captured), the deep scan did NOT complete — this is not a zero-topic cluster. `kcp discover` populates `msk_cluster_config` via AWS control-plane APIs from anywhere; `kcp scan clusters` adds the Kafka-protocol layer (topics, partitions, ACLs) and needs broker line-of-sight. On a private cluster with no reachability, `kcp scan clusters` silently skips the cluster and still exits success. Do not trust the success exit — verify the state file actually contains topic data. Topics/scale is a foundational input; route to re-scan-from-inside-the-VPC or the hybrid manual-intake fallback (below). Hold the topic/partition/scale-dependent work rather than assuming a count.

`discovered_clients` is a separate case — it's populated by `kcp scan client-inventory`, a different command. `null` there reliably means that scan didn't run (Row 10).

**Manual-intake default for absent fields.** When a row's check names a KCP state file field that has no equivalent in the manual `migration-profile.yaml` schema, the absence of evidence in the manual profile defaults to **Not triggered** — report it as such with a note like "not indicated in manual profile." Do NOT report Unknown (scan gap) for fields the manual schema simply doesn't carry. Only treat as Unknown when the user explicitly says they don't know whether the condition applies (e.g., "I'm not sure if tiered storage is on"), or when a row has explicit "Unknown — confirm with owning teams" guidance (Rows 13, 14). Schema silence ≠ scan failure ≠ user uncertainty.

**Auth is a per-cluster set, not a single value.** MSK clusters can enable multiple listeners/auth methods simultaneously (`ClientAuthentication` can have several modes true at once; the manual profile's `clusters[].auth_types` is a list). Capture and reason over the full set — do not collapse to a single method. An unauthenticated listener in the set is the one that matters for migration (Row 17) — Confluent Cloud has no unauthenticated equivalent.

| # | Red Flag | Check | Response when triggered |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Schemaless source (no SR) | `.schema_registries` empty or missing | Ask in Plan: adopt SR during migration or continue schemaless. Record the decision. |
| 2 | Kafka version OR IBP below CL migration-use-case floor | `.regions[].clusters[].aws_client_information.msk_cluster_config.Provisioned.CurrentBrokerSoftwareInfo.KafkaVersion` below the **migration-use-case CL floor** (Kafka 2.4.0+ / CP 5.4.0+ — verify live against the [CL source requirements doc](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/multi-cloud/cluster-linking/index.md)). **Note: the general CL floor of Kafka 3.0+ does NOT apply to MSK migration sources** — MSK clusters on Kafka 2.4–2.9 are eligible. **Also verify the source `inter.broker.protocol` (IBP) meets CL's IBP floor — fetch the floor live** (a separate general requirement, NOT relaxed by the migration exception; do not assume it tracks the 2.4.0 product floor). A customer at a newer Kafka binary with a stale IBP is ineligible even though the binary version passes. The KCP state file does not currently surface IBP; treat as Unknown (scan gap) and surface as an Open Question for the source owner. For manual intake, read `clusters[].ibp_version` from the migration profile. | CL incompatible. Upgrade source Kafka binary and/or bump `inter.broker.protocol` to the fetched IBP floor before migration, or take an alternative path. |
| 3 | IAM auth enabled on any cluster | `.aws_client_information.msk_cluster_config.Provisioned.ClientAuthentication.Sasl.Iam.Enabled == true` (Provisioned) OR `.Serverless.ClientAuthentication.Sasl.Iam.Enabled == true` (Serverless) | Plain Cluster Linking (the default path) handles IAM without changing client auth — add a SASL/SCRAM listener for the cluster link only (Provisioned), or use a KCP jump cluster (Provisioned, or required for Serverless which is IAM-only). Moving clients off IAM is optional modernization (IAM is AWS-proprietary; CC clients use API keys/OAuth/mTLS), not a migration gate. Only the Gateway path requires pre-migrating clients off IAM. Also surface `kcp create-asset migrate-acls iam` for IAM-policy → CC RBAC translation (applies whether ACLs were scanned or skipped). |
| 4 | AWS Glue Schema Registry in use | `.schema_registries[].type == "glue"` or user reports Glue | KCP-supported path. Schema Linking is CC-SR-to-CC-SR only per [SL docs](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/sr/schema-linking.md); Glue migrates via `kcp create-asset migrate-schemas --glue-registry` (see [migrate-schemas docs](https://confluentinc.github.io/kcp/latest/command-reference/create-asset/migrate-schemas/)). See Plan's Schema Migration Path Selection for caveats. |
| 5 | Partition count >10,000 on any cluster | `.topics.summary.total_partitions` (user) > 10,000 | High complexity. Plan for phased migration. |
| 6 | MSK Connect managed connectors present | `.aws_client_information.connectors \| length > 0` | Check CC managed-connector availability before assuming CMU can migrate each. |
| 7 | Self-managed Connect clusters present | Primary signal: `.kafka_admin_client_information.self_managed_connectors \| length > 0`. **Cross-reference with Row 15:** if Row 15 identifies a Kafka Connect framework triad (matching `connect-offsets`, `connect-status`, `connect-configs` under a common prefix like `-cdc` or `-events`), Row 7 **triggers** even when `self_managed_connectors` is null or empty. Reason: KCP's self-managed Connect scanner (`scanSelfManagedConnectors` in `internal/services/kafka/kafka_service.go`) looks for a topic named literally `connect-configs` and returns empty when it's not present — so prefixed worker-fleet triads (e.g., `connect-configs-cdc`, `connect-configs-events`) are NOT detected even when they're clearly active. A null/empty scan result does not rule out self-managed Connect when Row 15 has topic evidence. | Check CC connector availability and CMU support for self-managed Connect. When Row 7 triggers via Row 15 cross-reference, cite the specific triads found (e.g., "`connect-configs-cdc` + `connect-offsets-cdc` + `connect-status-cdc` → self-managed Connect fleet active, not visible to KCP scanner"). **Recommend closing the connector scan gap before Plan commits connector paths.** Name the specific follow-up: re-run `kcp scan self-managed-connectors` (or, if KCP can't reach the worker fleets, dump configs from each Connect cluster's REST API) so Plan has the actual connector inventory — types, source/sink systems, throughput — before picking migration paths. State this explicitly in the Assess output's commands-the-skill-would-propose section, not only as an Open Question to ask owners. |
| 8 | Multi-region source | `.regions \| length > 1` | Multi-region source. Each region needs its own network and Cluster Link; a single CC environment can hold clusters across all of them. Plan networking and CL per region. |
| 9 | Zero Kafka ACLs with IAM enabled | Topics populated AND cluster is PROVISIONED AND (`acls == null` OR `acls \| length == 0`) AND IAM enabled. See null-vs-empty guidance above. | Triggered: scan confirmed zero ACLs with IAM on — authz is in IAM policies, not Kafka ACLs. `kcp create-asset migrate-acls iam` is the migration path. Report **Unknown (scan gap)** only when topics are also null/empty (whole admin scan didn't run). |
| 10 | Client inventory gap | `.discovered_clients \| length == 0` on any cluster | Not a blocker for Plan; blocker for confident Switchover. Recommend re-running `kcp scan client-inventory` with broker-log (S3) access before cutover. |
| 11 | MSK Express broker tier in use | InstanceType matches `express.*` | Newer MSK tier. Verify CL compatibility with Express brokers live against [CL source requirements](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/multi-cloud/cluster-linking/index.md). |
| 12 | Tiered storage in use | **KCP state file:** `.msk_cluster_config.Provisioned.StorageMode == "TIERED"` on any cluster. **Manual `migration-profile.yaml`:** `clusters[].storage_mode == "TIERED"` on any cluster. If `storage_mode` is null/absent on every cluster, report **Not triggered** with the note "tiered storage not indicated in manual profile" — do NOT report Unknown (scan gap). The schema's null is the absence of evidence; only treat as Unknown when the user explicitly says they don't know whether tiered storage is in use. When triggered, also surface `peak_tiered_storage_gb` per cluster (if populated) — Plan's Tiered Storage section uses this to size the backfill discussion. | Historical tiered data does not transfer via CL. Decide at Plan: keep source accessible during retention window or bulk backfill. |
| 13 | EOS / Kafka transactions in use | Not directly in state file | Mark as "Unknown — confirm with owning teams." CL does not support EOS/transactions. |
| 14 | Kafka Streams apps consuming from source | Internal topics matching `*-changelog` or `*-repartition` are a signal | Mark "Unknown — confirm." If present, changelog topics must NOT be mirrored; state stores rebuild post-cutover. |
| 15 | Connect / tooling activity inferred from internal topic names | Scan `.regions[].clusters[].kafka_admin_client_information.topics.details[].name` for **any** topic-name pattern that suggests connector, replication, or tooling activity beyond the connector scan. See signal categories below. | If matches found, list each topic (or pattern + count) with cluster, infer the tool when possible, and flag as Plan/Migrate scope expansion. Connect workers and tooling often run outside the scanned MSK perimeter — the connector scan can show zero while actual connector activity is clearly present in internal topics. |
| 16 | Cost-to-inventory reconciliation (hidden / undiscovered clusters) | **KCP state file:** Extract broker instance types from AWS Cost Explorer usage-type strings in `.regions[].costs.results[].Groups[].Keys[]` (patterns like `Kafka.m7g.*`, `Express.m7g.*`, `Kafka.t3.*`). Compare the set of instance types appearing in cost data against the set of instance types in the discovered cluster inventory (`.regions[].clusters[].aws_client_information.msk_cluster_config.Provisioned.BrokerNodeGroupInfo.InstanceType`). **Manual `migration-profile.yaml`:** Compare `cost_line_items[].usage_type` strings against the `broker_instance_type` values on `clusters[]`. If `cost_line_items` is empty/absent, report **Not triggered** with the note "cost data not provided in profile" — not a scan gap, but a known absence the user can fill in later. | Triggered if any cost-data instance type does not correspond to a discovered cluster AND the spend is material — judge materiality relative to the discovered-cluster cost baseline (a line item on par with or larger than one of the scanned clusters is material; a line item that persists across most months of the cost window is material even if individually small). Cite the usage-type string and annual/monthly spend as evidence. Likely indicates a cluster that `kcp discover` did not enumerate (different region, different AWS account, or excluded by scan parameters). Recommend re-running `kcp discover` across all regions and all relevant accounts before committing Plan scope. Single-month line items that don't recur may be a decommissioned or resized cluster — note and deprioritize. |
| 17 | Unauthenticated listener present | **KCP state file:** `.aws_client_information.msk_cluster_config.Provisioned.ClientAuthentication.Unauthenticated.Enabled == true` on any cluster. **Manual `migration-profile.yaml`:** `clusters[].auth_types` includes `unauthenticated`. | Triggered: Confluent Cloud has no unauthenticated/plaintext equivalent (CC mandates SASL_PLAIN/OAUTHBEARER + TLS). Clients using the unauthenticated listener break at cutover. They must move to a CC-supported method (API keys / OAuth / mTLS) before cutover — roll this into the Pre-Migration Workstream. Note this is independent of how the cluster link authenticates. |

**Signal categories for Row 15 (not an exhaustive list — recognize the pattern, don't just match names):**

- **Non-standard `__`-prefixed topics.** `__consumer_offsets`, `__transaction_state`, `__amazon_msk_canary` are Kafka/MSK internals and expected. Anything else starting with `__` is likely connector or tooling output.
- **Heartbeat topics.** Names containing `heartbeat` or `heartbeats` (with or without `__` prefix). Common signal of a source connector that emits heartbeats for lag monitoring.
- **Kafka Connect framework triads.** The presence of topics named `connect-offsets`, `connect-status`, `connect-configs` (or any three-topic set with those suffixes under a common prefix) indicates a Kafka Connect cluster using this Kafka as its coordination backbone.
- **Streams artifacts.** Topics ending in `-changelog`, `-repartition`, `-changelog-repartition`, or matching `<app-id>-<store>-changelog` patterns indicate Kafka Streams applications.
- **MirrorMaker 2 artifacts.** Topics prefixed with `mm2-`, or with cluster-alias suffixes (`<alias>.heartbeats.internal`, `<alias>.checkpoints.internal`), or named `mm2-offset-syncs.<alias>.internal` indicate active replication. MM2 internal topics are a load-bearing signal for switchover sequencing — the source environment is already in an active replication relationship, which affects cutover ordering.
- **Tool-specific internal topics.** Anything obviously tooling-scoped — Cruise Control artifacts, observability/metric-collection tooling, custom pipeline framework internals. If the name looks like it belongs to infrastructure rather than an application, treat as tooling signal.
- **Suspiciously symmetric topic sets.** Three topics sharing a prefix with different suffixes (e.g., `<prefix>-offsets`, `<prefix>-status`, `<prefix>-configs`) are usually framework output — Connect, MirrorMaker, custom pipeline tooling.

**Known common patterns (illustration only — DO NOT treat as exhaustive):** `__debezium-*`, `__mongodb-*`, `__KafkaCruiseControl*`, `connect-*`, `mm2-*`, `*-changelog`, `*-repartition`. Real customer environments will have patterns not listed here (Elasticsearch, Snowflake, JDBC, Salesforce, custom plugins, internal naming conventions). Match the **signal category**, not a fixed string list.

**Required regex patterns when scanning topic names.** Use these anchored patterns — loose matching produces false positives on domain names that happen to contain similar strings:

- **MirrorMaker 2:** `\.checkpoints\.internal$`, `\.heartbeats\.internal$`, `^mm2-offset-syncs\..*\.internal$`, `^mm2-`. The `<alias>.checkpoints.internal` and `<alias>.heartbeats.internal` suffixes are the clearest MM2 signatures — produced by active replication and easy to miss if the regex is too narrow (e.g., matching only `^mm2-` misses both). The `mm2-offset-syncs.<alias>.internal` pattern carries the cluster alias inline.
- **Kafka Streams (anchored suffixes only):** `-changelog$`, `-repartition$`, `-changelog-repartition$`. Use the end-of-name anchor. Loose matching like `contains("changelog")` produces false positives on domain names (e.g., `pubsub-blockstreamer-*` is a block-streaming domain name, not a Streams state store).
- **Kafka Connect framework triad — Apache / Confluent Platform / MSK Connect default:** look for all three of `connect-offsets`, `connect-status`, `connect-configs` under a common prefix (naked or `<prefix>-offsets`/`<prefix>-status`/`<prefix>-configs`). The full triad together is the signal — a single `connect-offsets` topic alone is weaker evidence.
- **Kafka Connect framework triad — Strimzi default:** Strimzi Kafka Connect uses the `connect-cluster-` infix in its default topic names. Pattern: `(^|/)connect-cluster-(offsets|configs|status)$` under common prefixes. Detect alongside the Apache/CP/MSK triad above — a Strimzi cluster will not show the bare `connect-offsets` topic but will show the three `connect-cluster-*` variants.
- **Source connector heartbeats:** topics containing `heartbeat` or `heartbeats` (with or without `__` prefix) — `__debezium-heartbeat.*`, `__mongodb_heartbeats`, and similar patterns per source-connector convention.

**Standalone Debezium Server is invisible to topic-based detection.** Debezium Server (the standalone process, not the Debezium connector running inside Kafka Connect) uses file-based offset storage by default (`FileOffsetBackingStore`) rather than Kafka topics, so it leaves no topic fingerprint. Debezium connectors running inside a Kafka Connect cluster are detected via the Connect triad above. If the customer reports Debezium activity but no Connect triad is detected, ask whether they're running standalone Debezium Server.

Anchored suffix matching and full-triad matching reduce false positives. When in doubt, cite the specific topic names that match so the user can eyeball whether they're real framework output or coincidentally-named domain topics.

**What to do with findings:** list the discovered patterns with evidence (cluster, topic names, counts) and, where possible, infer what the source tool is. If a pattern doesn't match a recognized tool, still flag it — "unknown tooling activity observed on X topics" is better than silent omission.

### Additional Observations (judgment-based, with guardrails)

The 17-row Red Flags checklist is a **floor, not a ceiling**. The skill won't catch every novel migration concern on its own — real migrations surface patterns we haven't cataloged (new MSK features, regulatory constraints, unusual client behaviors, enterprise-specific configurations). Include additional findings in an "Additional Observations" section when they qualify.

**A finding belongs in Additional Observations only if ALL of these hold:**

1. It's a **structural migration concern** (blocks a path, adds pre-migration work, forces cluster type escalation, or requires special handling at Switchover). If it's just an environment characteristic, put it in Environment Summary, not here.
2. It **traces to a specific state file field or scan observation** — not a hunch, not general MSK knowledge. Cite the field path or the observed pattern.
3. It's **not already captured by a Red Flags row**. If it's a more specific version of an existing row (e.g., "Express broker tier with 1.3M msg/sec" is still Row 11, Express in use — add the msg/sec as evidence, not a new row).
4. It would **change the Plan if confirmed** — e.g., force a different cluster type, require a pre-migration workstream, constrain the switchover pattern.

Format Additional Observations as a short list below the Red Flags checklist, each with: finding, state file evidence, implication for Plan.

**Additional Observations is where the Red Flags checklist grows from.** If the same observation shows up across multiple migrations, it should become a new Red Flags row. Surface that to the user when you notice a pattern: "This has come up before — consider adding to the Red Flags checklist."

### What NOT to include as red flags

- Private networking. That's a networking characteristic, not a red flag — it's the expected case for production MSK. Cover in Environment Summary.
- "Cluster X is the load-bearing cluster." Observation, not a red flag. Cover in Notable Shape if relevant.
- Normal fan-out ratios (egress > ingress). Not a red flag on its own. Plan stage handles cluster type via the hard-limits table.
- Generic "high scale" observations without a specific threshold trigger.
- Any concern you can't tie to a state file field or observed pattern.

**Handoff framing — use this consistent phrasing at the end of Assess output:**

Once the checklist is produced and the Environment Summary is populated, end Assess with:

> **Ready to move to Plan?** Open questions above can carry forward — they don't block Plan production (Plan commits with working assumptions). Say "write the Plan" to proceed, or answer specific open questions first to tighten the assumptions Plan will make.

Do not invent alternate phrasings ("What would you like to do?" / "Where do you want to go from here?" / etc.). The consistent prompt tells the user exactly what to say next.

## What "done" looks like for this stage

An environment profile exists — as a KCP state file, MCP-captured data, or a populated `migration-profile.yaml`. At minimum:

- Cluster count, Kafka version, auth type (per cluster), networking accessibility, topic/partition scale
- Schema Registry state (type, subject count, or confirmed schemaless)
- Connector inventory (count, types, managed vs self-managed)
- Peak throughput (ingress/egress MBps)
- Red flags surfaced and acknowledged

Missing fields are recorded as known gaps, not fabricated.
