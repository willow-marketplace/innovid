description: Architect, build, and debug Kafka Streams apps (JVM-embedded stream processing). Use when user mentions KStream, KTable, topology, TopologyTestDriver, StreamsBuilder, interactive queries, GlobalKTable, joins/windows/aggregations, or debugging issues (rebalancing, state stores, lag, deserialization errors). Also use when user wants to optimize Kafka Streams for WarpStream or tune Kafka Streams client configuration for WarpStream. Do NOT trigger for Flink, connectors, CDC, or plain producer/consumer.

# Kafka Streams — Architect, Build, Debug

JVM-embedded stream processing library with no separate cluster.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Lazy-Load References Only
**Do NOT read all reference files upfront. Read ONLY what you need, when you need it.**

- User asks "how do I join two topics?" → Read `references/topology-patterns.md` § Joins Decision Tree only
- User asks "build me a Kafka Streams app" → Read `references/build-templates.md` when writing build files, not before
- User asks "my app is crashing" → Read the specific section in `references/debugging.md` for that symptom
- Most questions need 0-2 reference files total, not all 10

**Never read multiple files preemptively "just in case"**

## Always Confirm Target Environment First

Before answering in any mode (Architect, Build, Debug), confirm the target environment if the user hasn't stated it: **Apache Kafka | Confluent Platform | Confluent Cloud | WarpStream**. Versions/auth shape every recommendation — KIP-1071 support, SASL config, ACL model, transactional-id expiry, CLI tool names all branch on this. Skip the question only if the user already named the environment.

**If the user selects WarpStream:** Read `references/warpstream-optimization.md` and apply its overrides on top of the standard config baseline. Key impacts for Kafka Streams:
- **EOS has a significant throughput cost** — `exactly_once_v2` enables idempotent producers internally, which reduces throughput on WarpStream due to limited in-flight request concurrency. Default to `at_least_once` with downstream deduplication unless the user has a strong need for EOS.
- Producer and consumer configs must be overridden (larger batches, higher linger, larger fetches). See the "Kafka Streams Specific" section in the shared reference.
- `fetch.min.bytes` is not supported — do not set it.
- `replication.factor` is cosmetic (always 3) — do not tune it.
- Zone-aware routing via `client.id` with `ws_az=<az>` suffix is critical for cost.
- Latency is higher (~250ms p50 produce vs single-digit ms on Kafka) — set expectations with the user.

## Mode Detection

Determine the user's intent and enter the appropriate mode:

| User intent | Mode | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| "I need to process events from topic X..." / "Build me a KS app..." / "I want to aggregate/filter/join..." | **Build** | Go to [Build Mode](#build-mode) |
| "How should I design my topology?" / "Should I use a KTable or GlobalKTable?" / "What join type do I need?" / "How do I handle late events?" | **Architect** | Go to [Architect Mode](#architect-mode) |
| "My Streams app is stuck/slow/crashing..." / "Why am I getting rebalancing loops?" / "How do I interpret this metric?" | **Debug** | Go to [Debug Mode](#debug-mode) |

If unclear, default to **Architect** — understand the problem before generating code.

### Flink-first check (Confluent Cloud only)

If user asks for generic stream processing on CC without mentioning KS, briefly offer Flink as alternative. Don't lecture.

---

## Architect Mode

Design the right topology. Translate user's data problem into KS primitives.

### Step 1: Understand the Data Problem

Confirm target environment first (see preamble). Then ask (skip if answered): What data (topics)? What output? Relationship between inputs (combine/enrich/group)?

### Step 2: Recommend the Topology Pattern

Match problem to pattern (read `references/topology-patterns.md` only for the specific pattern needed). Present: why it fits, data flow in plain English, KS primitives involved, tradeoffs/alternatives.

### Key Decision Trees

When needed, read only the relevant section:
- **Combine topics**: `references/topology-patterns.md` § Joins Decision Tree
- **Aggregate over time**: `references/topology-patterns.md` § Windowing Decision Tree
- **Enrichment/lookup**: `references/topology-patterns.md` § Enrichment Patterns
- **Exactly-once**: `references/topology-patterns.md` § Exactly-Once (walk through before recommending — at-least-once is simpler if downstream can dedupe)

After user confirms, go to Build Mode.

---

## Build Mode

Generate a complete, runnable Kafka Streams project.

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask (skip if already answered):

1. **What does your app do?** Push back on vague requests.
2. **Topics & data flow**: Input/output topics? Schematized? If yes, retrieve schema (don't generate new ones). How do topics connect (joins/lookups/independent)?
3. **Schema format** (skip if using existing): Avro (default) | Protobuf | JSON Schema
4. **Build tool**: Gradle (default) | Maven
5. **Target environment** (REQUIRED): Apache Kafka | Confluent Platform | Confluent Cloud | WarpStream (read `references/config-baseline.md` when generating config; if WarpStream, also read `references/warpstream-optimization.md` for client overrides)
6. **Credentials**: CC needs 2 API keys (Kafka + SR). CP/AK needs bootstrap + SR URLs + auth type (read `references/cli-commands.md` if needed)
7. **Deployment sizing**: Partitions? Instances? State size? (read `references/architecture.md` or `references/production-hardening.md` § Deployment Sizing if needed)
8. **Test data**: Has data or wants sample data generated?

### Step 2: Plan Resources

Present plan: topics to create (source/output/DLQ), schemas to register. Changelog/repartition topics auto-created by KS. **If the user says input topics already exist, omit them from `create-topics.sh` — the script should only create new topics (typically output + DLQ).**

### Step 3: Generate the Project

Generate: project structure, schemas, App.java, TopologyBuilder.java, config, simplelogger.properties, docker-compose (if local), scripts, TopologyTest.java, .env.example, monitoring comments.

**Read references only as needed:**
- Topology code? → `references/topology-patterns.md` for the specific pattern
- Build file structure? → `references/build-templates.md`
- Schema syntax? → `references/schema-patterns.md`
- Config properties? → `references/config-baseline.md` for env-specific blocks
- Scripts? → `scripts/create-topics.sh`, `scripts/teardown.sh`
- Local dev? → `references/docker-compose.md`

**Gradle**: Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.12` after creating build files.

If user wants sample data: generate SampleDataProducer.java and `produce` task.

### Step 4: Production Hardening (if production target)

**Trigger:** User says "production"/"prod"/"deploy" or specifies K8s/ECS/Docker Swarm or requests multiple instances.

Add production components (read `references/production-hardening.md` for details if needed): Logback JSON logging, `logback.xml`, health check endpoint, `Dockerfile` with JVM tuning, KIP-1034 DLQ handler, K8s YAML (if K8s), shadow/fat jar plugin.

### Step 5: Walk Through the Code

Explain topology, config choices, how to run, what to monitor. Mention `group.protocol=streams` (KIP-1071) provides 50-80% faster rebalancing (requires AK 4.2+/CP 8.2+).

### Step 6: Run the App Before Handing Off

**You must actually start the app against a real broker and observe it reach `RUNNING` before declaring the task done.** Generated code that compiles and passes `TopologyTestDriver` tests can still fail at startup — version-mismatch `NoClassDefFoundError`s, silent logger fallbacks, missing runtime deps, and import-path errors all slip past `compile` + `test` and only surface against a real broker / Schema Registry. A green build is not a working app.

Branch on the target environment chosen in Step 1:

**Local (Apache Kafka or Confluent Platform via the generated `docker-compose.yml`):**
1. `docker compose up -d` and wait for Kafka + SR to be healthy (`docker compose ps`, or curl SR `/subjects`)
2. `./create-topics.sh`
3. Start the app **in the background** (`./gradlew run` or `mvn exec:java`) so you can read its logs while it runs
4. Tail the log and confirm `State transition from REBALANCING to RUNNING` within ~30s. If you don't see it, read the actual stack trace, diagnose via `references/debugging.md` § Startup Failures, fix, restart, re-verify
5. If the user wanted sample data: produce a few records and confirm output appears on the destination topic
6. Stop the app and `docker compose down` (or leave running if the user wants to keep iterating — ask)

**Confluent Cloud:**
You usually cannot run end-to-end yourself because the cluster + SR API keys are the user's. Do the most you can without them, then hand off the rest:
1. If `.env` has real CC creds (the user has set up a real `.env`): run the app locally pointed at CC (`./gradlew run` auto-loads `.env`) and follow steps 3–5 above. Don't skip just because it's CC — if you have creds, run it.
2. If creds are placeholders or not provided: do **not** fabricate a successful run. Instead:
   - Run `./gradlew build` (compile + unit tests) and report the result
   - List the exact commands the user must run to verify (`./create-topics.sh --cloud`, `./gradlew run`, the consume command from `references/verification.md` § Confluent Cloud) and what success looks like (`State transition from REBALANCING to RUNNING`, records on the output topic)
   - Tell the user explicitly: "I couldn't run this against your CC cluster because I don't have your API keys — please run the steps above and paste any errors back."

**WarpStream:**
You usually cannot run end-to-end yourself because the WarpStream cluster and credentials are the user's. Follow the same approach as Confluent Cloud:
1. If `.env` has real WarpStream creds: run the app locally (`./gradlew run` auto-loads `.env`) and follow the Local steps 3–5 above. Note that `State transition from REBALANCING to RUNNING` may take longer due to WarpStream's higher metadata latency.
2. If creds are placeholders or not provided: do **not** fabricate a successful run. Instead:
   - Run `./gradlew build` (compile + unit tests) and report the result
   - List the exact commands the user must run to verify (`./create-topics.sh`, `./gradlew run`) and what success looks like (`State transition from REBALANCING to RUNNING`, records on the output topic)
   - Remind the user to set `client.id` with `ws_az=<az>` in their `.env` for zone-aware routing
   - Tell the user explicitly: "I couldn't run this against your WarpStream cluster because I don't have your credentials — please run the steps above and paste any errors back."

In the handoff, state plainly which of the above you did. If you ran it and saw `RUNNING`, say so. If you only compiled, say only that. Don't imply a runtime verification you didn't perform.

For CC consume commands, schema-aware producers, and reset procedures, read `references/verification.md`.

## Debug Mode

### Step 1: Classify the Problem

| Symptom | Category | Go to |
|---|---|---|
| App crashes on startup | **Startup failure** | `references/debugging.md` § Startup Failures |
| App runs but no output / stops processing | **Processing stall** | `references/debugging.md` § Processing Stalls |
| Rebalancing loops / constant rebalancing | **Rebalancing** | `references/debugging.md` § Rebalancing Issues |
| High lag / slow processing | **Performance** | `references/debugging.md` § Performance |
| Deserialization errors / poison pills | **Data quality** | `references/debugging.md` § Deserialization Errors |
| State store issues (corruption, growth, recovery) | **State** | `references/debugging.md` § State Store Issues |
| Thread failures / `StreamsUncaughtExceptionHandler` | **Thread health** | `references/debugging.md` § Thread Failures |
| Memory issues (OOM, high heap, RocksDB) | **Memory** | `references/debugging.md` § Memory Issues |
| Low throughput or KAFKA_STORAGE_ERROR on WarpStream | **WarpStream config** | `references/warpstream-optimization.md` |

### Step 2: Gather Context

Confirm target environment first (see preamble) — most debug paths branch on it. Then ask for: error message, config, KS/Java versions, new app or regression?

### Step 3: Diagnose and Fix

Read the relevant section in `references/debugging.md` for the identified category. Provide fix with explanation.

## Invariant Checklist

Non-negotiable defaults. Apply all. Read reference files only if you need implementation details.

1. **Schematized data**: SR serdes (`SpecificAvroSerde`, `KafkaProtobufSerde`, `KafkaJsonSchemaSerde`). Set `schema.registry.url`, `default.key.serde`, `default.value.serde`. JSON Schema: set `json.value.type`. Protobuf: set `specific.protobuf.value.type` (references/config-baseline.md)
2. **Versions**: KS 4.x / CP 8.x, Java 17+
3. **KIP-1071**: `group.protocol=streams` (default). Remove if `UnsupportedVersionException`. Unsupported: static membership, regex topics, standby replicas, warm-up replicas (references/topology-patterns.md § Assignment Strategy)
4. **Four-tier error handling**: `DeserializationExceptionHandler`, `ProcessingExceptionHandler` (KIP-1034), `ProductionExceptionHandler`, `StreamsUncaughtExceptionHandler`. Use MaxFailures pattern for uncaught (references/production-hardening.md § Error Handling)
5. **Explicit naming**: `ensure.explicit.internal.resource.naming=true`
6. **Graceful shutdown**: Hook with `streams.close(30s)` on SIGTERM/SIGINT
7. **Monitoring**: `metrics.recording.level=INFO` (references/config-baseline.md)
8. **Log verbosity**: Generate `simplelogger.properties` (references/build-templates.md)
9. **Defensive topology**: Guard lambdas in prod (null checks, try/catch). Dev: simpler is fine.
10. **Schema parity**: Avro/Protobuf/JSON Schema all supported (references/build-templates.md, references/schema-patterns.md)
11. **Test caching**: TopologyTestDriver tests need `statestore.cache.max.bytes=0` to avoid non-deterministic assertions.
12. **Avro logical type Java mappings**: Avro 1.12+ generates `java.time.Instant` for `timestamp-millis`/`timestamp-micros`, `LocalDate` for `date`, `BigDecimal` for `decimal`, etc. **Never use raw `long`/`int` literals** with generated setter methods — use `Instant.EPOCH`, `Instant.now()`, `Instant.ofEpochMilli(...)`. Use `Instant.isAfter()`/`isBefore()` instead of `Math.max()`/`Math.min()` for timestamp comparisons. Applies to topology code, aggregation initializers, producers, AND test helpers (references/schema-patterns.md § Java type mapping).
