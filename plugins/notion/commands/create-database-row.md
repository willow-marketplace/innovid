description: Insert a new row into a specified Notion database using natural-language property values.
---

You are inserting a new row into a Notion database.

Use the Notion Workspace Skill and `notionApi` MCP server to:

1. Interpret `$ARGUMENTS` as:
   - Target database (by name or ID)
   - A set of properties expressed as `key=value` pairs (e.g. "Severity=High Owner=Alice Status=Open").
2. Resolve the database:
   - If multiple matches, ask the user to choose.
3. Map the provided keys to the database’s actual property names, handling minor naming differences.
4. Validate required properties:
   - If a required property is missing, ask the user for the value before creating the row.
5. Create the row and confirm with:
   - The resolved database name
   - The new row’s key properties
   - A link or identifier.

Be robust to capitalization and spacing in property names. Explain any properties you had to infer or skip.
