# Build Task from Notion

You are planning a task that is tracked in Notion. Your end goal is to put a plan in the task doc in Notion. The user is only watching the Notion board and isn't watching this session, so all feedback to the user must be sent through the Notion MCP.

## Input

The user has provided a Notion task URL: `$ARGS`

## Your Task

1. **Fetch the task details** from Notion using the MCP tools
   - Get the page content including title, description, and any relevant properties
   - Look for acceptance criteria, requirements, or specifications
   - Read any linked pages or references if needed

2. **Mark planning**
   - Change the status of the task to "planning".
   - Update the "Agent status" field to contain a short generic text description: 🤖 emoji followed by a word like "Starting..." or "Working..."

3. **Build it**
   - Make a plan for how to work on the task per the specification. For example, if this a coding task, 
   - At each step, update the "Agent status" field to explain what's currently happening, so the user can see what's going on. Keep it brief: a relevant emoji followed by a few words. Examples: "📂 Searching relevant files...", "✍️ Writing the plan..."
   - For most complex tasks you will probably need to get some user input. If you need to get user input to clarify the spec or answer other questions, follow the Communication Protocol below. Try to ask just a few questions at a time, don't overwhelm the user with too many questions at once.

4. **Update the task status**
   Once complete:
   - Write the plan into the task page, in a new section at the end of the page called "Plan"
   - Update the task status in Notion to "Ready"
   - Follow the Communication Protocol below and briefly tell the user the results of the task. Link to the diff explanation if appropriate for a code change.

## Communication Protocol

Every time you want to communicate with the user, follow the following steps.

- Add a comment to the task. Prefix your comment with "Message from Claude:" on its own line in bold.
- Set the "Agent blocked" column to true, and the Agent Status column to a short message explaining the request, like "❓ Choose a color scheme" or "❓ Give architecture feedback"
- Poll every 10 seconds to see if the user has responded with their own comment. (Follow polling instructions below)

## How to poll

- Always use a sub-agent to poll with max turns set to 100 to avoid polluting the parent content. 
- You can use a Bash sleep interleaved with MCP tool call. 

## Notes

- If the URL is invalid or inaccessible, ask the user to verify the URL and their Notion connection
- If requirements are unclear, ask clarifying questions before writing the plan
