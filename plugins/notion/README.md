## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Fully packaged Notion Skills
Includes all four high-quality Skills from the Notion Cookbook:

- **Knowledge Capture**
- **Meeting Intelligence**
- **Research Documentation**

This provides Claude with tools to:

- Search your workspace  
- Retrieve pages & databases  
- Create and update pages  
- Append notes or blocks  
- Insert database rows  
- Work with properties safely
