## LLM Selection

`list_llm_models.py` returns two kinds of entry, told apart by `source`:

- `gateway` — a model in the DataRobot LLM Gateway catalog. Selected by its `api_model`.
- `deployed` — an existing DataRobot text-generation deployment. Selected by its `deployment_id`.

### Recommending

- Prefer a `gpt-5`, `claude-4-5`, or `gemini-2.5` gateway model unless the user gives cost or other constraints.
- If none of those families appear, take the highest-capability gateway model by name: prefer `large`, `pro`, `opus`, `sonnet` over `mini`, `haiku`, `flash`.
- **If there is no `gateway` entry at all**, the LLM Gateway is disabled or empty on this instance. That is the normal shape of an on-prem install, not an error. Recommend a `deployed` entry instead, name it by its `name` (the deployment label), and tell the user that is what you are doing and why.
- Only show the full catalog when the user explicitly asks to browse.

### Recording a deployed LLM in `agent_spec.md`

Every deployment reports the same `api_model`, the placeholder `datarobot-deployed-llm`. It identifies the *source*, never one deployment. So a deployed choice is a pair, and both fields are required:

```yaml
model: "datarobot-deployed-llm"
llm_deployment_id: "6a43eb5f10dbecadbebc5b2b"
```

Take `llm_deployment_id` from the entry's `deployment_id`. Without it nothing downstream can tell which deployment was chosen: `setup_template.py` refuses the pair outright, and the dress rehearsal would have to guess.

A gateway choice sets `model` only and leaves `llm_deployment_id` out.

### What the choice changes downstream

| Step | Gateway model | Deployed LLM |
|---|---|---|
| [Template setup](helper-scripts.md#setup_templatepy) | `--llm-model` | `--llm-model` **and** `--llm-deployment-id` |
| `.env` written | `LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL` | plus `LLM_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `INFRA_ENABLE_LLM=deployed_llm.py`, `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY=0` |
| [Dress rehearsal](dress-rehearsal.md) | LLM Gateway chat endpoint | the deployment's own chat endpoint |

On the deployed path the deployment id is the only thing that selects the model. `dr dotenv setup` rebuilds `.env` from the template's own prompt schema, which does not carry `LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL` for that path, so a real model name passed alongside an id is not persisted. Routing is unaffected.

### Caveats worth telling the user

- A deployment is offered when it is active and its target type is text generation. Nothing checks that it answers chat requests, and some text-generation deployments (guard models, for instance) do not. If the rehearsal reports the deployment as unavailable, that is the likely cause.
- Deployed entries carry no provider or context window, so those columns read `-`.
- Deployed entries require `dr` v0.2.79 or newer to appear in the CLI listing. On an older `dr` the script falls back to a direct API call, so they still list.
