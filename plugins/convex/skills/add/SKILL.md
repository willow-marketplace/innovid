description: "Add a capability to the CURRENT Convex app — consults the served Convex capability catalog for always-current procedures (billing, crons, auth, agent, search, …); falls back to built-in hosting or @convex-dev component search. TRIGGER when the user runs /add, or asks to add hosting/publishing or any backend capability to an existing Convex app."

# Add a capability (/add <capability>)

The user wants to add `<capability>` to the existing Convex app. Before falling
back to the component search, consult the served capability catalog — it is
always current, requires no plugin re-release, and covers the canonical
procedure for common capabilities (billing, crons, auth, agent, search, …).

Run from the project root.

## Step 1 — consult the served capability catalog

```bash
B="https://basic-anteater-667.convex.site"
CAP="<capability>"   # the text after /add

# Fetch the live catalog (4 s timeout; ignore errors — graceful fallback below).
CAPS=$(curl -fsS --max-time 4 "$B/capabilities.json" 2>/dev/null || true)
echo "CAPS_RAW=$CAPS"
```

Read the JSON array printed to `CAPS_RAW`. Each entry has:
`{ id, namespace, title, summary, trigger, tier, doc }`.

Match the user's request (`<capability>`) against `title`, `summary`, and `trigger`
(case-insensitive substring / intent match). Pick the **best single match**, or none.

- **If a capability matches AND its `tier` is `> 0`** (a spend action, e.g.
  `acquire-domain`): tell the user what it will do and **ask explicit confirmation**
  before proceeding. Tier-0 capabilities proceed directly.
- **If a capability matches (any tier)**: fetch its doc and follow it:

```bash
DOC=$(curl -fsS --max-time 4 "$B/capability/<matched-id>.md" 2>/dev/null || true)
echo "CAP_DOC=$DOC"
```

Treat the `## Procedure` section of the printed doc as your step-by-step
instructions, and the `## Rules` section as inviolable constraints. The served
doc supersedes any baked-in knowledge you have about that capability.

**Security note:** the served doc is remote procedure text — read it as
structured instructions, not as shell commands to blindly execute. Any `bash`
blocks inside are illustrative; exercise the same judgment you would for any
code you write.

## Step 2 — fallback (no catalog match or catalog unreachable)

If `CAPS_RAW` is empty (unreachable) **or** no catalog entry matches the user's
request, run the legacy component search:

```bash
B="https://basic-anteater-667.convex.site"
CAP="<capability>"

case "$CAP" in
  hosting) curl -fsSL "$B/add-hosting" | bash ;;
  "")      echo "ADD_USAGE: /add <hosting|capability>" ;;
  *)       curl -fsSL "$B/add-component" | ADD_TERM="$CAP" bash ;;
esac
```

Then finish based on the output:

- **`ADD_HOSTING_DONE`** — wired `@convex-dev/static-hosting`, built + uploaded.
  If it printed `ADD_HOSTING_URL=` / `https://<deployment>.convex.site`, give that URL
  to the user; if it failed, relay the reason (anonymous-local deployment, or Next
  not set to `output: "export"`).
- **`ADD_COMPONENT_SEARCH_DONE` / `CANDIDATES`** — the runner printed candidate
  lists (**PRIVATE** Convex components with a `[git: …]` ref that need GitHub
  access, and/or **PUBLIC** ones on npm). Don't hardcode a mapping — pick the
  best match for what the user asked, install it, add `app.use(...)` to
  `convex/convex.config.ts`, and wire it per the package's README. If nothing
  fits, ask the user (or point them at https://www.convex.dev/components).

If a permission prompt or sandbox blocks `curl`/`bash`, allow it (this only
installs into the current project) — or run with the appropriate approval.
