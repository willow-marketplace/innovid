## Code Generation Directive

Before writing any PayPal code, detect SDK version and read the correct reference:

1. **v5** — `sdk/js?client-id=` script tag, `paypal.Buttons()`, Hosted Fields → use `checkout.md` / `expanded-checkout.md`
2. **v6** — `web-sdk/v6/core` script tag, `createInstance`, `<paypal-button>` web components → use `js-sdk-v6.md`
3. **New project** (no existing SDK) — default to v6, use `js-sdk-v6.md`
4. **Unclear** — ask the user which version they are using

## MCP Boundary

When the PayPal MCP server is connected, prefer MCP tools for live operations (creating orders, managing subscriptions, fetching disputes). Use this skill for architecture decisions, code generation, and integration guidance — not for executing API calls that MCP tools can handle directly.

## Out of Scope

This skill does NOT cover:
- PayPal Commerce Platform (multi-party marketplaces) — see [Commerce Platform docs](https://developer.paypal.com/md/docs/multiparty/)
- PayPal Mobile SDKs (iOS/Android native) — see [Mobile SDK docs](https://developer.paypal.com/md/sdk/mobile/)
- Braintree direct integration (non-Agentic) — see [Braintree docs](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs)
- Zettle POS / PayPal Here — see [Zettle developer docs](https://developer.zettle.com)
- Tax calculation or compliance
- PayPal Marketing Solutions

## Post-Generation Environment Check

After generating PayPal integration code, proactively scan the project to verify the environment is correctly configured for the code you just wrote.

- Identify what credentials the generated code needs (e.g. `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, client token endpoint)
- Look for env files (`.env`, `.env.sample`, `.env.example`, `.env.local`) in the project root and `server/`/`client/` subdirectories
- If `.env.sample` or `.env.example` exists but no `.env` — flag it
- If `.env` exists — check the required keys are present and non-empty
- For frontend projects, read the source files to determine how `clientId` reaches the client before checking — do not assume a pattern
- Flag missing or incomplete env setup inline after the code; confirm briefly if everything looks good
- If the env setup cannot be determined, ask: "How is `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` configured in this project?" before flagging anything as missing

## Pre-Delivery Validation Checklist

Before presenting generated PayPal integration code, verify:
1. Credentials are not hardcoded (use env vars)
2. `PayPal-Request-Id` included on all POST requests
3. Sandbox URLs used (not production) in examples
4. Webhook signature verification is present
5. `intent` matches the use case (CAPTURE vs AUTHORIZE)
6. BNPL messaging only rendered for eligible countries/currencies
7. Venmo eligibility check before rendering Venmo button
8. Server-side order creation (not client-side `actions.order.create()`)
9. Error handling for INSTRUMENT_DECLINED (422)
10. Retry logic with exponential backoff for 429
11. `debug_id` logged from error responses
12. No deprecated or legacy APIs recommended — never use NVP/SOAP, v1/payments, Hosted Fields, or Adaptive Payments
13. Token caching implemented; Apple Pay domain verification mentioned if Apple Pay is used
