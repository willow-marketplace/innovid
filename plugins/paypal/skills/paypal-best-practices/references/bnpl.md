# Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)

**When to Use:** Developer mentions installments, pay later, pay in 4, split payments, financing, or BNPL messaging banners.
**When NOT to Use:** One-time payments without installments (see checkout.md), subscriptions (see subscriptions.md).
**For v6 SDK:** See [js-sdk-v6.md](js-sdk-v6.md) for the v6 approach (`createPayLaterOneTimePaymentSession`, `createPayPalMessages`).

## Integration

[BNPL](https://developer.paypal.com/md/docs/checkout/pay-later/us/) is surfaced through the JS SDK and Orders API v2. Add `components=messages` to the SDK URL to render promotional messaging banners using `paypal.Messages({ amount, pageType })` on product detail, cart, and checkout pages — highest-impact placement for conversion. Render the Pay Later button with `fundingSource: paypal.FUNDING.PAYLATER`.

PayPal automatically determines buyer eligibility — no separate API call needed. Merchants receive the full amount upfront. Always use `intent=CAPTURE` (not `intent=subscription`) for BNPL flows.
