# Kubernetes metrics installation - Docs

> **Note:** Metrics is in private alpha and the viewer is only turned on for selected teams, so you may not be able to view metrics you send yet. Setup details, including the ingestion endpoint, may change before general availability.

If your Kubernetes workloads already expose Prometheus-format `/metrics` endpoints, the PostHog metrics agent scrapes them and forwards everything to PostHog. One `helm install`, no application changes.

The agent runs as a single instance by default. To scale beyond one pod, use [shards](#scale-out-with-shards) rather than replicas: two plain replicas would scrape every target twice and double-count all metrics.

1.  1

    ## Prerequisites

    Required

    You need:

    -   A running Kubernetes cluster with `helm` v3 installed
    -   Pods that expose Prometheus metrics (the standard `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` annotation pattern)
    -   Your PostHog project token

    The chart creates a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding so the agent can discover pods across all namespaces. If your cluster uses strict RBAC policies, confirm you have permission to create cluster-scoped roles.

2.  2

    ## Get your project token

    Required

    You'll need your PostHog project token to authenticate metrics requests. This is the same token you use for capturing events with the PostHog SDK.

    > **Important:** Use your **project token**, which starts with `phc_`. Do **not** use a personal API key (which starts with `phx_`).

    You can find your project token in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings).

3.  3

    ## Install the Helm chart

    Required

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    helm install posthog-metrics-agent oci://ghcr.io/posthog/charts/posthog-metrics-agent \
      --set posthog.apiKey=<ph_project_token>
    ```

    For EU Cloud, set the host explicitly:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    helm install posthog-metrics-agent oci://ghcr.io/posthog/charts/posthog-metrics-agent \
      --set posthog.apiKey=<ph_project_token> \
      --set posthog.host=https://eu.i.posthog.com
    ```

    If you manage secrets separately, point the chart at an existing Kubernetes Secret containing a `posthog-api-key` key instead of passing the token directly:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    helm install posthog-metrics-agent oci://ghcr.io/posthog/charts/posthog-metrics-agent \
      --set posthog.existingSecret=my-posthog-secret
    ```

    The API key is stored in a Secret and injected as an environment variable – it never appears in the ConfigMap.

    ## Configure metric discovery

    Required

    ### Annotation discovery (default)

    By default, the agent discovers and scrapes any pod annotated with `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`. Two optional annotations control the scrape target:

    | Annotation | Default | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | prometheus.io/scrape | – | Set to "true" to opt a pod in |
    | prometheus.io/path | /metrics | Override the metrics path |
    | prometheus.io/port | Pod's container port | Override the scrape port |

    Example pod annotation:

    YAML

    PostHog AI

    ```yaml
    metadata:
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/port: "9090"
        prometheus.io/path: "/custom/metrics"
    ```

    ### Static targets

    For services that don't carry Prometheus annotations, add fixed `host:port` targets:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    helm install posthog-metrics-agent oci://ghcr.io/posthog/charts/posthog-metrics-agent \
      --set posthog.apiKey=<ph_project_token> \
      --set 'scrape.staticTargets={my-service:9090,another-service:8080}'
    ```

    You can combine annotation discovery with static targets. To disable annotation discovery entirely and only use static targets, set `scrape.annotationDiscovery=false`.

    ### Extra scrape configs

    For advanced use cases, pass raw Prometheus `scrape_configs` YAML via `scrape.extraScrapeConfigs`. This is appended verbatim to the collector configuration.

    ## Verify metrics are flowing

    Recommended

    1.  Confirm the agent pod is running:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=posthog-metrics-agent
    ```

    2.  Open [**Metrics**](https://app.posthog.com/metrics) in PostHog and pick a metric from the name picker
    3.  Data points should appear within a minute of the agent starting

    If nothing shows up, check the agent logs for connection or authentication errors:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=posthog-metrics-agent
    ```

    The agent also exposes its own metrics (scrape successes, queue depth, points sent or dropped) on port `8888`, so you can monitor the monitor.

6.  6

    ## Keep data through restarts

    Optional

    By default, if PostHog is briefly unreachable the agent retries from memory, and a pod restart during that window drops whatever was buffered. To keep those samples, back the queue with a persistent volume:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    --set persistence.enabled=true
    ```

    The chart provisions a volume per agent (using `persistence.size` and `persistence.storageClass`), and samples scraped during an outage survive restarts and deliver when PostHog is reachable again.

7.  7

    ## Scale out with shards

    Optional

    One agent scrapes every target itself, which is enough for most clusters. For a large target set, run a fleet:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    --set shards=4
    ```

    The chart switches to a StatefulSet, each pod works out its own shard from its name, and every target is scraped by exactly one pod: nothing is scraped twice, nothing is missed. Combine with `persistence.enabled=true` to give each shard its own durable queue.
