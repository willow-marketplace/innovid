# Python metrics installation - Docs

> **Note:** Metrics is in private alpha and the viewer is only turned on for selected teams, so you may not be able to view metrics you send yet. Setup details may change before general availability.

The [posthog-python](/docs/libraries/python.md) SDK includes the `posthog.metrics` API, so you can record metrics with the same client you use for events and feature flags.

1.  1

    ## Install posthog-python

    Required

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    pip install posthog
    ```

    Metrics requires an up-to-date SDK version, so upgrade if you're on an older release.

2.  2

    ## Initialize the client

    Required

    Set a service name so metrics from different systems stay easy to tell apart. It's attached to every series and used by the Metrics UI for filtering.

    Python

    PostHog AI

    ```python
    from posthog import Posthog
    posthog = Posthog(
        "<ph_project_token>",
        host="https://us.i.posthog.com",
        metrics={"service_name": "billing-worker"},
    )
    ```

    Use your **project token** (the same one you use for capturing events), not a [personal API key](/docs/api.md#authentication).

3.  3

    ## Record metrics

    Required

    Use the metric type that matches what you're measuring:

    Python

    PostHog AI

    ```python
    # Counters only go up: things you count
    posthog.metrics.count("invoices.processed", 1, attributes={"plan": "pro"})
    # Gauges go up and down: current values
    posthog.metrics.gauge("queue.depth", 42)
    # Histograms record distributions: durations, sizes
    posthog.metrics.histogram("job.duration", 187, unit="ms")
    ```

    The client is thread-safe and pre-aggregates: samples fold into per-series aggregates in memory and flush as one OTLP data point per series every few seconds, so recording in hot paths is cheap. A burst of 10k `count()` calls costs one data point on the wire.

    Keep attribute values small and bounded: `route`, `status`, and `plan` are good attributes; user IDs, session IDs, and request IDs are not. Every unique combination creates a new series.

4.  4

    ## Instrument alongside existing metrics

    Optional

    If your service already records metrics with Prometheus, StatsD, or another system, don't rip it out. Add the PostHog call next to the existing one, reusing the same metric name and attributes, so both systems chart the same series while you evaluate.

5.  5

    ## Flush before exit

    Required

    For short-lived processes (cron jobs, CLIs, serverless functions), flush before exiting so the last aggregation window isn't lost:

    Python

    PostHog AI

    ```python
    posthog.metrics.flush()
    ```

6.  6

    ## Test your setup

    Recommended

    1.  Trigger the code path that records a metric
    2.  Open **Metrics** in the PostHog sidebar and pick your metric from the name picker
    3.  Data points should appear within a minute of sending
