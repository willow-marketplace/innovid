PostHog's application metrics work with any OpenTelemetry-compatible client. If your app or infrastructure already exports OTLP metrics, point the exporter at PostHog. No PostHog packages required.

1.  1

    ## Install OpenTelemetry packages

    Required

    The key requirements are:

    -   Use OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) for metrics export over HTTP
    -   Send metrics to your Metrics endpoint (see configuration step below)
    -   Include your project token in the Authorization header or as a `?token=` query parameter

    Find the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language in the [official registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/). If you already run an OpenTelemetry Collector, you can add PostHog as an additional exporter without touching application code.

2.  2

    ## Get your project token

    Required

    You'll need your PostHog project token to authenticate metrics requests. This is the same key you use for capturing events and exceptions with the PostHog SDK.

    > **Important:** Use your **project token** which starts with `phc_`. Do **not** use a personal API key (which starts with `phx_`).

    You can find your project token in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings).

3.  3

    ## Configure the exporter

    Required

    Most OpenTelemetry SDKs pick up standard environment variables, so configuration is often no more than:

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT="https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/metrics"
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer <ph_project_token>"
    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="my-app"
    ```

    Set `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` so metrics from different systems stay easy to tell apart. It's attached to every series and used by the Metrics UI for filtering.

    If you configure the exporter in code instead:

    **Endpoint:**

    PostHog AI

    ```
    https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/metrics
    ```

    **Authentication:** Include your project token either as an `Authorization` header:

    PostHog AI

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <ph_project_token>
    ```

    Or as a query parameter on the endpoint:

    PostHog AI

    ```
    https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/metrics?token=<ph_project_token>
    ```

4.  4

    ## Test your setup

    Recommended

    1.  Trigger the code path that records a metric
    2.  Open **Metrics** in the PostHog sidebar and pick your metric from the name picker
    3.  Data points should appear within a minute of sending

    If nothing shows up, check that the endpoint ends in `/i/v1/metrics`, that the token starts with `phc_`, and see the [troubleshooting section](/docs/metrics.md#troubleshooting).
