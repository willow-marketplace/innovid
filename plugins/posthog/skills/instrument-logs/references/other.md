# Other languages logs installation - Docs

PostHog Logs works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible client. Check the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) for your specific language or framework.

1.  1

    ## Install OpenTelemetry packages

    Required

    The key requirements are:

    -   Use OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) for log export over HTTP
    -   Send logs to your Logs endpoint (see configuration step below)
    -   Include your project token in the Authorization header or as a `?token=` query parameter

    Find the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language in the [official registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/).

2.  2

    ## Get your project token

    Required

    You'll need your PostHog project token to authenticate log requests. This is the same key you use for capturing events and exceptions with the PostHog SDK.

    > **Important:** Use your **project token** which starts with `phc_`. Do **not** use a personal API key (which starts with `phx_`).

    You can find your project token in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/settings).

3.  3

    ## Configure the SDK

    Required

    Configure your OpenTelemetry SDK to send logs to PostHog.

    **Endpoint:**

    PostHog AI

    ```
    https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs
    ```

    **Authentication:** Include your project token either as an `Authorization` header:

    PostHog AI

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <ph_project_token>
    ```

    Or as a query parameter on the endpoint:

    PostHog AI

    ```
    https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v1/logs?token=<ph_project_token>
    ```

4.  4

    ## Test your setup

    Recommended

    Once everything is configured, test that logs are flowing into PostHog:

    1.  Send a test log from your application
    2.  Check the PostHog Logs interface for your log entries
    3.  Verify the logs appear in your project
