# Go logs installation - Docs

1.  1

    ## Install OpenTelemetry packages

    Required

    Terminal

    PostHog AI

    ```bash
    go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log
    go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlplog/otlploghttp
    ```

2.  2

    ## Get your project token

    Required

    You'll need your PostHog project token to authenticate log requests. This is the same key you use for capturing events and exceptions with the PostHog SDK.

    > **Important:** Use your **project token** which starts with `phc_`. Do **not** use a personal API key (which starts with `phx_`).

    You can find your project token in [Project Settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

    ## Configure the SDK

    Required

    Set up the OpenTelemetry SDK to send logs to PostHog.

    Go

    PostHog AI

    ```go
    package main
    import (
        "os"
        "context"
        "log"
        "log/slog"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlplog/otlploghttp"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/stdout/stdoutlog"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/bridges/otelslog"
        otellog "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/global"
    )
    func main() {
        ctx := context.Background()
        // Create OTLP HTTP exporter
        exporter, err := otlploghttp.New(ctx,
            otlploghttp.WithEndpoint("us.i.posthog.com"),
            otlploghttp.WithURLPath("/i/v1/logs"),
            otlploghttp.WithHeaders(map[string]string{
                "Authorization": "Bearer <ph_project_token>",
            }),
        )
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }
        // you could also set this outside your application
        os.Setenv("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME", "my-service")
        stdoutExporter, _ := stdoutlog.New()
        // Create logger provider
        loggerProvider := otellog.NewLoggerProvider(
            otellog.WithProcessor(otellog.NewBatchProcessor(exporter)),
            // optional, also log to stdout
            otellog.WithProcessor(otellog.NewSimpleProcessor(stdoutExporter)),
        )
        defer func() {
            loggerProvider.Shutdown(context.Background())
        }()
        global.SetLoggerProvider(loggerProvider)
        slog.SetDefault(otelslog.NewLogger(""))
        log.Println("this is a log line")
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, you can pass the API key as a query parameter by modifying the URL path:

    Go

    PostHog AI

    ```go
    otlploghttp.WithURLPath("/i/v1/logs?token=<ph_project_token>")
    ```

4.  4

    ## Use OpenTelemetry logging

    Required

    Now you can start logging with OpenTelemetry:

    Go

    PostHog AI

    ```go
    import (
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log"
    )
    logger := otel.GetLoggerProvider().Logger("my-app")
    logger.Info(ctx, "User action",
        log.String("userId", "123"),
        log.String("action", "login"),
    )
    ```

5.  5

    ## Test your setup

    Recommended

    Once everything is configured, test that logs are flowing into PostHog:

    1.  Send a test log from your application
    2.  Check the PostHog Logs interface for your log entries
    3.  Verify the logs appear in your project
