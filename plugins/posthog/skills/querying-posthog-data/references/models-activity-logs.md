# Activity logs

## Activity log (`system.activity_logs`)

Activity logs track user and system actions across PostHog entities, providing an audit trail of changes to feature flags, insights, dashboards, experiments, and more.

> **Note:** Only team-scoped activity logs are visible. Organisation-level logs (e.g. membership changes) are not included because they are not associated with a specific team.

### Columns

Column | Type | Nullable | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`id` | String | NOT NULL | Activity log entry UUID.
`team_id` | Integer | NOT NULL |
`activity` | String | NOT NULL | Action performed, e.g. 'created', 'updated', 'deleted'.
`item_id` | String | NOT NULL | Id of the object the activity is about.
`scope` | String | NOT NULL | Type of object affected, e.g. 'Insight', 'FeatureFlag', 'Dashboard'.
`detail` | JSON | NOT NULL | JSON detail of what changed (field-level diffs, context).
`created_at` | DateTime | NOT NULL | When the activity occurred.

### Detail JSON Structure

```json

## Common Query Patterns

**Find recent activity for a scope:**

```sql
SELECT id, activity, item_id, detail, created_at
FROM system.activity_logs
WHERE scope = 'FeatureFlag'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Find all changes to a specific entity:**

```sql
SELECT activity, detail, created_at
FROM system.activity_logs
WHERE scope = 'Insight' AND item_id = '42'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**Search for a specific change in detail JSON:**

```sql
SELECT id, scope, activity, detail, created_at
FROM system.activity_logs
WHERE JSONExtractString(detail, 'name') ILIKE '%signup%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20
```
