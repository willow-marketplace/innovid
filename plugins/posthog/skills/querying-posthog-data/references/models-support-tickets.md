### Key Relationships

- Tickets belong to a **Team** (`team_id`)
- Tickets can link to a customer analytics account through `organization_id = system.accounts.external_id`
- Tickets are linked to a **Person** via `distinct_id`
- Ticket assignments are managed via `TicketAssignment` and queryable through `system.support_tickets.assignee`

### Important Notes

- The `status` field follows a lifecycle: `new` -> `open` -> `pending`/`on_hold` -> `resolved`
- The `anonymous_traits` field contains customer-provided key-value pairs, commonly including `name` and `email`
- The `session_context` field may contain `session_replay_url`, `current_url`, and other session metadata
- Tickets are never deleted; filter by `status` to exclude resolved tickets
