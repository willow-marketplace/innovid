description: Diagnostic-only skill for Slurm scheduler and node-daemon issues on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Slurm clusters. Scope mirrors the HyperPod troubleshooting guide. Invoke when the user reports a Slurm node stuck in down/drain, "Node unexpectedly rebooted" after auto-repair, slurmd not running, jobs stuck PENDING with REASON=Resources while sinfo shows idle nodes, jobs stuck COMPLETING after node replacement, GRES/GPU counts wrong, scontrol ping failing, slurmctld unresponsive, an Action:Reboot/Replace request that did not trigger HyperPod auto-recovery, or auto-resume not restarting a job. Also triggers on "drain before reboot", "diagnose a Slurm node", "investigate stuck jobs."

# HyperPod Slurm Debugger

Diagnostic-only. Identify and classify Slurm scheduler and node-daemon issues on
HyperPod Slurm clusters. Do not run, recommend, or print any state-mutating command.
For remediation, link to the official AWS or Slurm documentation.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user reports any of the symptoms in the [decision table](#decision-table).

## When NOT to invoke

- Cluster has `Orchestrator.Eks` — invoke `hyperpod-node-debugger` or `hyperpod-nccl`.
- Single-node hardware fault with healthy Slurm scheduler — invoke `hyperpod-node-debugger`.
- NCCL training-hang investigation — invoke `hyperpod-nccl`.
- Node unreachable via SSM — invoke `hyperpod-ssm`.

## Constraints

- Read-only. Do not run, recommend, or print state-mutating commands.
- For any remediation, link to AWS or Slurm docs. The user authorizes and executes.
- IaC-managed cluster (Terraform / CloudFormation / CDK): warn that direct mutation
  drifts the live state from the IaC plan.

Canonical recovery URLs:
[references/slurm-details.md → Authoritative recovery documentation](references/slurm-details.md).

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI v2, authenticated for the target account and region with permissions:
  - `sagemaker:DescribeCluster`, `sagemaker:ListClusterNodes`
  - `ssm:StartSession` on the HyperPod-created SSM document
- [Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
  installed locally.
- `jq` ≥ 1.6.
- `unbuffer` (from the `expect` package). Required — without it `aws ssm start-session`
  returns empty stdout intermittently with `Cannot perform start session: EOF` and every
  check silently misreports. Install: `expect` package on Amazon Linux / RHEL / Debian /
  Ubuntu / macOS. Script exits at prerequisite check if missing.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Collect inputs

Ask the user for:

1. HyperPod cluster name (not Slurm partition name).
2. AWS region.
3. Optional: a specific Slurm node name.

### Step 2 — Confirm orchestrator

```bash
aws sagemaker describe-cluster --cluster-name <NAME/ARN> --region <REGION> \
  --query 'Orchestrator' --output json
```

If `Orchestrator.Eks` is present, stop. Route per [When NOT to invoke](#when-not-to-invoke).

### Step 3 — Run the diagnostic script

```bash
bash scripts/slurm-diagnose.sh --cluster <NAME> --region <REGION>
# Scope to a node:
bash scripts/slurm-diagnose.sh --cluster <NAME> --region <REGION> --node <SLURM_NODE>
```

Relay the script output to the user verbatim.

### Step 4 — Map findings → docs

For each finding, look up the section in the [decision table](#decision-table) and link
the user to the corresponding AWS / Slurm doc. Do not type out remediation commands.

## A: Node Down

Node is `down` because `slurmd` stopped responding. Causes: `slurmd` crash, disk full,
OOM, network partition, hardware fault.

Script checks: `systemctl is-active slurmd`, `srun -w <NODE> hostname` (RPC layer), disk,
memory.

Link: <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-cluster-setup/blob/troubleshooting-doc-20250917/troubleshoot/index.md>

If node returns to `down` after a manual resume → escalate to `hyperpod-node-debugger`.

Context: [references/slurm-details.md § A](references/slurm-details.md#-a-node-down--diagnostic-context).

---

## B: Unexpected Reboot

Node is `down*` with Reason `"Node unexpectedly rebooted"` because `slurmd`
re-registered after an out-of-band reboot. Upstream Slurm behavior, not HyperPod.
Node is typically healthy.

Links:

- <https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-hyperpod-cluster-setup/blob/troubleshooting-doc-20250917/troubleshoot/index.md>
- <https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html> (`state=resume` semantics)

If node reboots again within minutes → escalate to `hyperpod-node-debugger`.

Context: [references/slurm-details.md § B](references/slurm-details.md#-b-unexpected-reboot--diagnostic-context).

---

## C: Controller State

`slurmctld` in-memory state can desync from the on-disk state. A controller restart reloads from `StateSaveLocation` and clears bad caches. User decides and executes.

Restart may help:

| Symptom                                            | Why                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING` with `REASON=Resources`, idle nodes      | Re-evaluates the queue                      |
| Jobs stuck `COMPLETING` after node replacement     | Controller held a reference to the old node |
| GRES (GPU, EFA) not released after a job ends      | Resource accounting de-synced               |
| Nodes stuck `Unknown` after reboot, `slurmd` is up | Re-registration was not processed           |
| `scontrol ping` times out                          | Controller event loop is hung               |
| Lost connection to `slurmdbd` / RPC errors         | DBD connection wedged                       |

Do NOT restart when:

- HyperPod replacement (`Action:Replace`) in progress on any node — concurrent changes
  fail the replacement.
- Only one compute node is bad — restart `slurmd` on that node.
- `sinfo` and `squeue` are responsive — problem is elsewhere.
- `journalctl -u slurmctld` not reviewed yet — panic / OOM will reproduce.
- `slurm.conf` was just edited — try `scontrol reconfigure` first.

### Folded triggers

- **slurmdbd disconnected** — `sacct` fails, accounting fields show `Unknown`,
  controller log spams `Unable to contact slurmdbd`. Restore `slurmdbd` before
  considering controller restart.
  <https://slurm.schedmd.com/accounting.html> ·
  [details](references/slurm-details.md#slurmdbd-connectivity).
- **Stale config** — `slurm.conf` / `topology.conf` mtime > slurmctld start.
  `scontrol reconfigure` first; restart is fallback.

Context: [references/slurm-details.md § C](references/slurm-details.md#-c-controller-state--diagnostic-context).

---

## D: Action Reason Mismatch

`scontrol update state=fail reason=...` was issued with a `reason` that does not match
`Action:Reboot` or `Action:Replace` exactly. HyperPod silently ignores anything else.
Script detects near-misses on nodes in `fail` state.

Required strings (case-sensitive, no whitespace, no punctuation):

- `Action:Reboot`
- `Action:Replace`

Context: [references/slurm-details.md § Action reason-string validation](references/slurm-details.md#action-reason-string-validation).

---

## E: Auto-resume

`--auto-resume=1` is an `srun` step option. It re-runs the step after HMA (the Health
Monitoring Agent) flags a node and Automatic node recovery replaces it.

Why it didn't restart the job:

- Flag on `sbatch` not `srun` — per-step; `sbatch` directives are silently ignored.
- HMA did not flag the node — failure was application/transient, not hardware. Step
  exits as a normal Slurm failure.
- Cluster `NodeRecovery` is `None` — faulty nodes are labeled but not replaced.
- No checkpointing — step restarts from process zero each iteration.
- AMI predates HMA support (released 2025-09-11) — needs AMI / cluster-software update.
