# Resource Attribution Enforcement

To track resources created or manipulated by AI agents, you **MUST** ensure
that standard CLI commands are tagged with appropriate attribution labels
under relevant conditions.

## Applicability

You should apply these attribution labels **ONLY** under the following
conditions:
1.  **DAK Tooling**: You are executing Python scripts, running MCP tools, or
    following workflows provided by the **Data Agent Kit**.
2.  **Domain Relevance**: You are operating on BigQuery datasets, GCS
    buckets, or Analytics infrastructure (including **Spark**,
    **Dataproc**, or Serverless Spark) intended for data preparation,
    deduplication, or analysis.

### 🚫 When to Omit
Do **NOT** apply these labels if you are running generic administrative
commands or working on infrastructure completely unrelated to Data Cloud /
Analytics (e.g., managing Compute Engines for web apps, setting up standard
IAM policies, etc.).

## BigQuery CLI (`bq`)

Whenever you execute a `bq` command that accepts the `--label` flag (including
but not limited to `bq query`, `bq load`, `bq extract`, `bq mk`, and `bq cp`),
you **MUST** append the attribution label.

-   **Flag Form**: `--label key=value`
-   **Mandatory Label**: `datacloud=<ide>`
-   **Deduction Rule**: Substitute `<ide>` with your actual environment/client
    (e.g., `vscode`, `jetski`, `antigravity`, `codex`, `gemini-cli`, `claude`).
    If you cannot determine your environment, use `ai-agent`. Note that
    BigQuery labels **cannot** contain dots or spaces.

### Examples

#### Query Example
**Incorrect**:
```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT 1"
```

**Correct** (assuming you are running in VS Code):
```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --label datacloud=vscode "SELECT 1"
```

#### Copy Example
**Incorrect**:
```bash
bq cp dataset1.table1 dataset2.table1_copy
```

**Correct** (assuming you are running in Jetski):
```bash
bq cp --label datacloud=jetski dataset1.table1 dataset2.table1_copy
```

## Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`)

Whenever you execute any `gcloud` command via `run_command`, you **MUST**
prepend the command with the `CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT` environment
variable to ensure proper resource attribution.

-   **Environment Variable**: `CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT=datacloud.<ide>`
-   **Deduction Rule**: Substitute `<ide>` with your actual environment/client
    (e.g., `vscode`, `jetski`, `antigravity`, `codex`, `gemini-cli`, `claude`).
    If you cannot determine your environment, use `ai-agent`. Note that
    values must use dots (e.g., `datacloud.vscode`), not colons.

### Examples

**Incorrect**:
```bash
gcloud compute disks create my-disk --size=10GB
```

**Correct** (assuming you are running in VS Code):
```bash
CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT=datacloud.vscode gcloud compute disks create my-disk --size=10GB
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This applies to **ALL** `gcloud` commands, whether they are read-only
> (`gcloud ... list`) or mutations (`gcloud ... create`).
