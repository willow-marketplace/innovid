# Accessibility Review

Accessibility in UI5 is incorporated in two levels: framework and application.
This review supports what application developers must still provide explicitly
to improve the accessibility of their application.

## Step 1 — Find the files

If `$ARGUMENTS` lists specific files, review only those.

Otherwise, discover all app source files automatically:

```!
find . \( -name "*.view.xml" -o -name "*.fragment.xml" -o -name "*.controller.js" \) \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/dist/*" \
  -not -path "*/test/*" \
  -not -path "*/resources/*" \
  | sort
```

If more than 15 files are found, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user choose:
- Review everything (may take a moment)
- Focus on a specific folder or area

Read each file in scope.

## Step 2 — Review

Check the code against the eight topics below. For each topic where you find a gap,
**read the corresponding topic file before writing the fix** — it contains the correct
API pattern and wrong/correct examples.

| # | Topic | What to detect | Topic file |
|---|-------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | Landmarks | `DynamicPage`, `Page`, `Panel`, `ObjectPage`, `FlexibleColumnLayout` missing `landmarkInfo` or `accessibleRole`; landmark role set without its corresponding label (e.g. `rootRole` without `rootLabel`) | `references/landmark.md` |
| 2 | Labeling | Inputs without `<Label labelFor>` (except inside `SimpleForm`); Tables without `ariaLabelledBy`; icon-only `Button` without `tooltip`; standalone `Icon` without `alt` and not marked `decorative`; `Image` with `decorative=false` and no `alt`; `Dialog` with `showHeader:false` and no `ariaLabelledBy` | `references/labeling.md` |
| 3 | Heading levels | `<Title>` without explicit `level`; heading level jumps (e.g. H1 → H3) within a view | `references/heading.md` |
| 4 | Focus & keyboard | `Dialog` or `Popover` without `initialFocus` when a specific starting element is required; larger composite areas that act as distinct logical regions and need a `sap-ui-fastnavgroup` `CustomData` entry; `tabindex` values greater than 0 in rendered HTML | `references/keyboard.md` |
| 5 | Keyboard shortcuts | Action buttons (save, delete, etc.) using plain `press=".onX"` that should support keyboard shortcuts but have no `CommandExecution` | `references/shortcut.md` |
| 6 | Invisible messaging | Dynamic state changes (save confirmations, errors, filter results) that are visible-only with no `InvisibleMessage.announce()` call in the handler | `references/invisible-message.md` |
| 7 | Reading order | Controls visually reordered via CSS/layout but out of sequence in XML; `ariaDescribedBy` pointing to IDs that appear later in the DOM | `references/reading-order.md` |
| 8 | Target size | `Link`, `ObjectIdentifier`, `ObjectStatus`, `ObjectNumber`, `ObjectMarker`, `ObjectAttribute` inside an interactive container without `reactiveAreaMode`; or in other dense layout without spacing | `references/target-size.md` |

## Step 3 — Report

For each gap found:

**Issue**: one line — names the control and the missing property/association
**Impact**: `critical` (blocks AT users entirely) | `serious` (significant barrier) | `moderate` (partial barrier) | `minor` (best practice, low direct impact)
**Why**: one sentence on user impact
**Fix**: minimal corrected XML or JS snippet (only the changed part)

Group findings by topic, critical/serious first within each group. End with a summary count by impact level.
If no gaps are found, say so.
