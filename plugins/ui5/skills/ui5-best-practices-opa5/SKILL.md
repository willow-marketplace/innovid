# OPA5 Guidelines and Tools

## Handle Special Cases (follow when planning and writing an OPA5 test)

## Set Up Browser Inspection Tools (follow **before running the OPA5 test**)
**Purpose:** Efficient inspection of test failures with minimal steps.
**Prerequisites:** A tool to load the OPA5 test in the browser and evaluate javascript in the browser window (e.g. MCP Playwright)
