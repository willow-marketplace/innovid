# Bigdata Thematic Research

Cross-sector research on one macro theme, ending in implementable ideas. Use Bigdata.com plugin tools for every fact.

**Use this skill when** the subject is a theme that cuts across sectors or borders. Not this skill when:

| Request | Use instead |
|---------|-------------|
| One sector's performance and outlook | Sector analysis |
| Sectors ranked against each other | Cross-sector comparison |
| One country's economy | Country analysis |
| One company exposed to the theme | Company brief / investment memo |

Common themes: AI and technology transformation, energy transition and clean tech, inflation and interest rates, deglobalization and reshoring, demographic shifts, geopolitical risk, fiscal policy and government spending.

## Data foundation (plugin tools)

| Tool | Purpose | Prerequisite |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `bigdata_search` | Theme coverage, implications, policy, market impact | None |
| `find_securities` | Entity ids for the most exposed companies | None |
| `bigdata_company_tearsheet` | Fundamentals and exposure of beneficiaries and losers | `find_securities` |
| `bigdata_country_tearsheet` | Geographic impact where available | None |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Define the theme scope

State the boundaries and the sub-themes explicitly before searching. An unbounded theme produces an unbounded report — this step is what keeps the deliverable usable.

### Step 2 — Search the theme (5–10 queries)

- "[Theme] investment implications outlook"
- "[Theme] winners beneficiaries stocks"
- "[Theme] risks losers vulnerable"
- "[Theme] policy government regulation"
- "[Theme] market impact analysis"
- "[Theme] sector exposure"

### Step 3 — Beneficiaries and casualties

Use `find_securities` and `bigdata_company_tearsheet` for the most exposed companies on **both** sides. A theme note that names only winners is a pitch, not research — quantify the exposure where the data allows (revenue share, capex tied to the theme, contract backlog).

### Step 4 — Geographic impact

Use `bigdata_country_tearsheet` (or search) for the countries most affected, positively and negatively.

### Step 5 — Implementation

Turn the analysis into concrete ways to express the theme: direct beneficiaries, second-order plays, avoided exposures, and what would invalidate the theme.

## Output

Follow [assets/report-template.md](./assets/report-template.md) exactly — section order, tables, sources, and footer.

- **Inline citations** `[1]`, `[2]` after every claim from a source, hyperlinked to the document URL.
- End with the numbered **Sources** table (source, date, URL), then the **Powered by Bigdata.com** line and **Disclaimer**, verbatim.
- Default format is Markdown. After delivering, you may ask: "Would you like me to create a Word document or presentation with this analysis?"

## Quality bar

Non-negotiables:

- Theme scope and sub-themes stated up front and held to
- **Both** beneficiaries and losers named, with exposure quantified where possible
- Policy dimension addressed — most macro themes are policy-driven
- Implementation section present: how to express the theme, and what would invalidate it
- Every claim from a source carries an inline citation and appears in the Sources table
