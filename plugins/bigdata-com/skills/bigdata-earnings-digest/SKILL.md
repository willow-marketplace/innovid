# Bigdata Earnings Digest

Deep dive on one earnings event that has already been reported. Use Bigdata.com plugin tools for every fact.

**Use this skill when** results are out and the user wants them broken down. Not this skill when:

| Request | Use instead |
|---------|-------------|
| Analysis ahead of an upcoming print | Earnings preview |
| 30 days of all developments, not one event | Company brief |
| "What is it worth" with no earnings event | Valuation snapshot |
| Comprehensive risk mapping | Risk assessment |
| Short reaction note against a stated thesis | Earnings reaction |

## Data foundation (plugin tools)

| Tool | Purpose | Prerequisite |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `find_securities` | Resolve company name → RavenPack `entity_id` | None |
| `bigdata_company_tearsheet` | Latest quarter, consensus, surprise, segments, history, sentiment/positioning fields | `find_securities` |
| `bigdata_events_calendar` | Date of the most recent earnings call | `find_securities` |
| `bigdata_search` | Release, transcript, analyst reactions, guidance, legal coverage | None |

If the company name is ambiguous after `find_securities`, ask:

> "I found multiple companies named [X]. Did you mean [Company A] in [Industry] or [Company B] in [Industry]?"

## Before you synthesize — quality over quantity

The digest is **forward-looking**, not a transcription of the release. Before writing, identify the **2–3 factors that dominate the forward debate after this print** and lead with them. Everything else is supporting detail — do not give every line item equal weight.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the company

Call `find_securities` with the company name to get the `entity_id`.

### Step 2 — Financial data

Call `bigdata_company_tearsheet` with the `entity_id` for:

- Latest quarterly results (most recent Q)
- Analyst estimates and consensus
- Latest earnings surprise data
- Historical trends for comparison
- Segment performance breakdown
- **Sentiment, ownership, insider, options/short** fields where exposed — these fill the structured positioning table

If more than one recent quarter is available, confirm which to analyze:

> "I see results for Q3 2024 (most recent) and Q2 2024. Should I analyze the latest Q3 results?"

### Step 3 — Earnings date

Call `bigdata_events_calendar` with the `entity_id` to pin down when the most recent earnings call was.

### Step 4 — Search earnings materials

Run **5–7 targeted `bigdata_search` queries**:

- "[Company] earnings results Q[X] [Fiscal Year]"
- "[Company] earnings transcript conference call"
- "[Company] analyst reactions upgrades downgrades"
- "[Company] guidance outlook management commentary"
- "[Company] earnings surprise beat miss"
- "[Company] lawsuit litigation regulatory ruling investigation" — post-print legal overhang not in the press release

Cover the official release and metrics, transcript highlights, analyst reactions and rating changes, management guidance, and market reaction. Extract **key quotes** from the transcript where available.

If the call isn't published yet:

> "The earnings call transcript isn't available yet. I'll analyze the press release and update once the call is published."

### Step 5 — Results analysis

Organize the numbers into:

- **Revenue and margins** — total vs consensus, by segment/geography, gross/operating/net margin, YoY and QoQ
- **Operating metrics and segments** — KPIs, segment results, customer/user metrics, geographic performance
- **Management guidance and commentary** — forward guidance vs consensus, strategic initiatives, market conditions, capital allocation
- **Cash flow and balance sheet** — OCF and FCF trends, balance sheet strength, capex and investments

Note accounting changes and one-time items explicitly.

### Step 6 — Surprises: magnitude and quality

For each beat or miss:

- Quantify in **% or bps** vs consensus
- Frame **magnitude** as approximate **standard deviations** against the company's typical surprise volatility where data allows
- Label it **sustainable vs one-time** — revenue volume or price vs buyback, tax, timing, or other one-timers
- Identify what actually drove the market reaction

Focus on business fundamentals, not just the stock move.

### Step 7 — Thesis check (forward-looking)

Even with no thesis supplied by the user, frame both sides:

- **For bulls:** this quarter **strengthened / weakened / left unchanged** the bull case because [specific evidence].
- **For bears:** this quarter **strengthened / weakened / left unchanged** the bear case because [specific evidence].

If the user *did* supply a thesis, state its status explicitly as **Intact / Strengthened / Weakened / Broken**, with the specific data points that support the call. Methodology: [references/thesis-construction.md](./references/thesis-construction.md).

### Step 8 — Quality signals

Build the table with a forward **watch for** column — monitoring, not just a backward check:

| Signal | This quarter | Prior quarter | Trend / note | **Watch for (forward)** |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| OCF vs net income | | | | |
| DSO | | | | |
| Inventory (if material) | | | | |
| Guidance vs actual (credibility) | | | | |

Depth: [references/quality-of-earnings.md](./references/quality-of-earnings.md).

### Step 9 — Sentiment & positioning (structured, not anecdotes)

Same discipline as the earnings preview: pull every **numeric** sentiment, insider, 13F/flow, and options/short field from the tearsheet first, then use Step 4 results to fill gaps. Write **"Not available"** for missing cells rather than dropping rows. A single sell-side note is not a substitute for positioning data.

### Step 10 — Scenario refresh + valuation cross-check

**Scenario refresh (post-print):** rebuild Bull / Base / Bear against the *new* information — probabilities summing to ~100%, what changed versus pre-print, price level or range, and the **probability-weighted expected value with the arithmetic shown**. Compute in prose/table by default; run [scripts/scenario_probability.py](./scripts/scenario_probability.py) only if the user explicitly asks for scripted math.

**Valuation cross-check:** current EV/EBITDA, P/E, FCF yield from the tearsheet vs recent history and peers. Answer directly: **does the reaction fit the surprise and the guidance?** Does the price now embed the new guidance?

## Output

Follow [assets/report-template.md](./assets/report-template.md) exactly — section order, mandatory tables, sources, and footer.

- Add inline citations as superscript-style numbers `[1]`, `[2]` immediately after claims, hyperlinked to the document URL.
- Every deliverable ends with the **Powered by Bigdata.com** line and the **Disclaimer**, verbatim.
- Default format is Markdown; offer a Word (.docx) or presentation version at the end if useful.

## Quality bar

Pass the PM test before delivering: **What's different?** **What matters (2–3 forward factors)?** **What should I do about it?** (net assessment, key risk, next catalyst — no position sizing). Would it survive a short, skeptical morning meeting without reading as a press-release recap?

Non-negotiables in every digest:

- Thesis check for **both** bull and bear, with evidence — this is what makes the digest forward-looking
- Surprise magnitude quantified, and labelled **sustainable vs one-time**
- Quality signals table with the **watch for** column filled
- Sentiment & positioning as structured data — tearsheet first, then search
- Scenario refresh with probabilities and **EV math shown**
- Valuation cross-check tying implications back to price
- Legal/regulatory search run, with overhangs surfaced
- Facts separated from analysis and implications
