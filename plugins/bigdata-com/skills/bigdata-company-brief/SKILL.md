# Bigdata Company Brief

Retrospective 30-day summary of material developments at a public company, with a "so what" on each. Use Bigdata.com plugin tools for every fact.

**Use this skill when** the user wants to catch up on what has already happened. Not this skill when:

| Request | Use instead |
|---------|-------------|
| Analysis ahead of an upcoming earnings call | Earnings preview |
| Breakdown of results just reported | Earnings digest / earnings reaction |
| "What is it worth" | Valuation snapshot |
| Structured risk mapping with likelihood/impact | Risk assessment |
| Full thesis, DCF, or variant perception | Investment memo |

## Data foundation (plugin tools)

| Tool | Purpose | Prerequisite |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `find_securities` | Resolve company name → RavenPack `entity_id` | None |
| `bigdata_company_tearsheet` | Profile, sector/industry, financial position, recent performance | `find_securities` |
| `bigdata_search` | News, filings, transcripts, legal and regulatory coverage | None |

If the company name is ambiguous after `find_securities`, ask:

> "I found multiple companies named [X]. Did you mean [Company A] in [Industry] or [Company B] in [Industry]?"

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the company

Call `find_securities` with the company name to get the `entity_id`.

### Step 2 — Business context

Call `bigdata_company_tearsheet` with the `entity_id` for the company profile (sector, industry, description), financial position, and recent performance metrics. This context is what lets you judge whether a news item is material — read it before searching.

### Step 3 — Competitive context (one pass)

Run `bigdata_search` at least once on industry structure and positioning:

- "[Company] competitive landscape market share"
- "[Company] vs competitors [Industry]"

A full five-forces write-up is not needed. **2–4 sentences** on concentration, pricing power, and disruption risk materially lift the brief. Mental model: [references/porter-five-forces.md](./references/porter-five-forces.md).

### Step 4 — Search recent news (last 30 days)

Use `bigdata_search` with natural-language queries that include the company name and a temporal reference. Run **5–10 searches** for coverage, then compress.

- "[Company] news last 30 days"
- "[Company] recent developments"
- "[Company] earnings announcement"
- "[Company] product launches partnerships"
- "[Company] regulatory legal updates"
- "[Company] lawsuit litigation court ruling investigation settlement last 30 days"

Cover all of: financial developments, product/technology announcements, partnerships and M&A, regulatory and legal matters, management changes. The explicit legal/litigation query is there so material non-operational items don't get buried under earnings headlines.

If the month was quiet, ask:

> "I haven't found any significant developments for [Company] in the last 30 days. Would you like me to extend the search period or focus on specific topics?"

### Step 5 — Categorize, and mark what is primary

Sort every finding into the six output categories: **Financial Results**, **Product/Tech Launches**, **M&A and Partnerships**, **Regulatory/Legal Updates**, **Management Changes**, **Other Material Events**.

While sorting, tag each item **primary** (material to value or the narrative) or **secondary**. Do not equal-weight the categories in the prose — quantity of headlines is not materiality. If a category is empty, write "No significant developments in this period" rather than padding it.

### Step 6 — Investment implication ("so what")

For each **material** event, give:

- **Date** — when it happened or was announced
- **Facts** — objective summary of what happened
- **Investment implication** — Bullish / Bearish / Neutral, tied to a value driver

Avoid generic labels. Replace "bullish for the stock" with the lever: "could support ~+$Nm revenue run-rate", "+Ybps margin", "de-risks [issue]", "lifts regulatory overhang on segment Z". If it isn't quantifiable, state the **specific mechanism** instead of a direction.

### Step 7 — Rank and synthesize

Rank the top **2–3** developments for the period and lead the executive summary with them. The overall assessment states the **net tilt and why**, not a recap of every bullet.

## Output

Follow [assets/report-template.md](./assets/report-template.md) exactly — section order, sources, and footer.

- Add inline citations as superscript-style numbers `[1]`, `[2]` immediately after claims, hyperlinked to the document URL.
- Every deliverable ends with the **Powered by Bigdata.com** line and the **Disclaimer**, verbatim.
- Default format is Markdown; offer a Word (.docx) or presentation version at the end if useful.

## Quality bar

Pass the PM test before delivering: **What's different?** **What matters (2–3 items)?** **What should I do about it?** (net assessment, key risk, next catalyst — no position sizing). Would it survive a short, skeptical morning meeting without reading as a news dump?

Non-negotiables in every brief:

- Competitive context present, not skipped
- Every material event carries date, facts, and a **mechanism-level** implication
- Top 2–3 developments ranked and surfaced in the executive summary
- Legal/regulatory search actually run, with material items shown
- Empty categories marked as such rather than padded
- Facts separated from analysis and implications
