# Bigdata Moat & Governance Review

Two questions that decide long-run returns: is the advantage durable, and are the stewards any good? Use Bigdata.com plugin tools for every fact.

**Use this skill when** durability and stewardship are the question. Not this skill when:

| Request | Use instead |
|---------|-------------|
| All risk categories rated | Risk assessment |
| Accounting reliability | Earnings quality screen |
| What the business is worth | Valuation snapshot |
| Full thesis with recommendation | Investment memo |
| Sector-wide structure | Sector analysis / playbook |

These two topics belong together: a wide moat run by poor capital allocators leaks value, and excellent management cannot rescue a business with no structural advantage.

## Data foundation (plugin tools)

| Tool | Purpose | Prerequisite |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `find_securities` | Resolve company name → RavenPack `entity_id` | None |
| `bigdata_company_tearsheet` | Returns, margins, reinvestment, buybacks, dividends, insider summary | `find_securities` |
| `bigdata_search` | Competitive position, share, pricing, governance, capital allocation history | None |

**Required on every call:** pass `plugin_slug: "bigdata-moat-governance-review"` in the request parameters of *every* Bigdata.com plugin tool call made while running this skill. The value is always the skill name, `bigdata-moat-governance-review`, regardless of the company or query.

**Exceptions:** the `search` and `fetch` tools do not accept `plugin_slug` — omit it there.

If the company name is ambiguous after `find_securities`, ask:

> "I found multiple companies named [X]. Did you mean [Company A] in [Industry] or [Company B] in [Industry]?"

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the company and its industry

Call `find_securities`, then `bigdata_company_tearsheet` for the returns and margin history that the moat assessment rests on.

### Step 2 — Identify the moat by type

Name the moat type — network effects, switching costs, cost advantage, intangibles (brand, patents, licenses), or efficient scale — and give the **evidence** for each claimed source. "Strong brand" without pricing evidence is not a moat finding. Taxonomy: [references/moat-taxonomy.md](./references/moat-taxonomy.md).

Search: "[Company] competitive advantage market share pricing power", "[Company] switching costs customer retention".

### Step 3 — Test moat strength with numbers

| Test | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| ROIC vs WACC, sustained | Whether the advantage converts to economic profit |
| ROIC trend over 5–10 years | Whether it is widening or eroding |
| Gross and operating margin vs peers | Pricing power in practice |
| Market share trend | Whether the position is being defended |
| Reinvestment rate at high ROIC | Whether the moat has runway |

A moat that does not show up as durable excess returns is a story, not a moat.

### Step 4 — Competitive advantage period and erosion

Estimate how long the advantage plausibly persists, and name the **erosion signals** to monitor: pricing pressure (usually the first sign), share loss to entrants or substitutes, ROIC compression toward WACC, rising customer churn, technology shifts. Industry structure context: [references/porter-five-forces.md](./references/porter-five-forces.md).

### Step 5 — Capital allocation track record

Assess where the cash has gone and what it earned:

- **M&A** — deals done, prices paid, returns achieved, write-downs taken
- **Buybacks** — bought at what valuations; repurchasing above intrinsic value destroys value
- **Dividends** — sustainability against FCF, and consistency
- **Reinvestment** — incremental ROIC on organic capex and R&D
- **Balance sheet** — leverage choices through the cycle

Framework: [references/capital-allocation.md](./references/capital-allocation.md). Search: "[Company] acquisitions track record write-down", "[Company] buyback history capital returns".

### Step 6 — Governance

- Board independence, size, refreshment, and relevant expertise
- Combined CEO/chair role, classified board, dual-class shares and voting concentration
- Compensation design: what metrics vest, over what horizon, and whether they align with per-share value
- Related-party transactions
- Insider buying and selling patterns, read in context rather than mechanically
- Guidance track record — a proxy for candor

Search: "[Company] CEO chairman combined role board independence", "[Company] executive compensation say on pay", "[Company] insider selling Form 4", "[Company] related party transactions".

### Step 7 — Combined verdict

Grade the **moat** (None / Narrow / Wide) and its **trend** (widening / stable / eroding), and grade **management quality** (Strong / Adequate / Weak) on capital allocation and governance separately. Then state what the combination means for the durability of returns, and what would change each grade.

## Output

Follow [assets/report-template.md](./assets/report-template.md) exactly — section order, tables, sources, and footer.

- Add inline citations `[1]`, `[2]` immediately after claims, hyperlinked to the document URL.
- Every deliverable ends with the **Powered by Bigdata.com** line and the **Disclaimer**, verbatim.
- Default format is Markdown; offer a Word (.docx) version if useful.

## Quality bar

Non-negotiables:

- Every claimed moat source backed by **evidence**, not adjectives
- ROIC versus WACC shown over time — the numerical test is mandatory
- Erosion signals named specifically, with what to watch
- Capital allocation judged on **returns achieved**, not on stated intentions
- Governance graded separately from capital allocation — they diverge often
- Both grades come with what would change them
