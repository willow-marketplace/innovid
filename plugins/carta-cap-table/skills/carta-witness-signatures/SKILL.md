# Witness & Spousal-Consent Signatures

Show the status of the extra signatures some equity awards need before they're fully in place.

## Background

When someone is granted equity, the award sometimes needs a signature from a person other than the recipient before it's complete:

- **Witness** — an independent person who confirms they watched the recipient sign. This is a legal requirement in some markets.
- **Spousal consent** — the recipient's spouse signs to acknowledge the award. This applies where local marital-property rules give a spouse an interest in equity earned during the marriage.

Each one is tracked as a **signature request** tied to a single award. A request moves through these stages:

| Stage | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Awaiting details** | The request exists, but the witness or spouse's name and email haven't been added yet. |
| **Awaiting signature** | Details are in and the signing link has been sent. Waiting on the witness or spouse to sign. |
| **Signed** | Done — the witness or spouse has signed. |
| **Expired** | The signing link's deadline passed before it was signed. Signing links expire about 30 days after they're sent. |

These three awards can carry signature requests: **option grants**, **RSAS (restricted stock awards)**, and **PIUs (profits interest units)**.

## When to Use

- "Did the witness sign Jordan's option grant?"
- "Which grants are still waiting on a signature?"
- "Is the spousal consent done for this award?"
- "Show me any expired signing links for this company."
- "List the outstanding witness signatures across my portfolio."


## Prerequisites

- **One company or one award** → you need the company. Get it from `list_accounts` (companies appear as `corporation_pk:` entries).
- **A single award** → you also need its type (`OPTION_GRANT`, `RSA`, or `PIU`) and the award itself. The company-wide list (below) returns these, so start there if you don't already know which award you mean.
- **A portfolio** → you need the portfolio. Get it from `list_accounts` (portfolios appear as `organization_pk:` entries) — this is the investor or firm view across the companies they hold or manage.

If a required input is missing, ask for it with `AskUserQuestion` before fetching (see carta-interaction-reference §4.1).

## Data Retrieval

Pick the command that matches the scope of the question.

**One company** — every request for a single company:

```
call_tool({"name": "cap_table__list__witness_signatures_for_corporation", "arguments": {"corporation_id": corporation_id}})
```

Optional filters: `request_type` (`WITNESS` or `SPOUSAL_CONSENT`), `status` (a list of `PENDING`, `FILLED`, `SIGNED`, `EXPIRED`), `page`, `page_size`.

**One award** — every request on a single award you've already identified:

```
call_tool({"name": "cap_table__get__witness_signatures_for_security", "arguments": {"corporation_id": corporation_id, "security_type": "OPTION_GRANT", "security_id": security_id}})
```

`security_type` is one of `OPTION_GRANT`, `RSA`, `PIU`.

**A portfolio** — requests across every company in a portfolio:

```
call_tool({"name": "cap_table__list__witness_signatures_for_portfolio", "arguments": {"portfolio_id": portfolio_id}})
```

Optional filters: `request_type`, `status`, `issuer_id` (narrow to one company), `page`, `page_size`.

> **Spousal consent in portfolio view**: the portfolio list returns witness requests only, unless you narrow it to a single company with `issuer_id`. Spousal-consent requests appear only for a single company that has the feature turned on. If a user asks about spousal consent across a whole portfolio, narrow to one company at a time.

> **Default status filter**: when you don't pass `status`, the results show the requests that usually need attention — those awaiting signature and those that have expired. To see requests still awaiting details or already signed, pass `status` explicitly (e.g. `"status": ["SIGNED"]`).

## Key Fields

Each request carries:

- `status`: `PENDING`, `FILLED`, `SIGNED`, or `EXPIRED` — map to the friendly labels in the Background table.
- `request_type`: `WITNESS` or `SPOUSAL_CONSENT`.
- `expires_at`: the signing deadline.
- `issuer_name`: the company that granted the award.
- `security_label`: the award's reference (for example, "ES-1007").
- `security_type`: `OPTION_GRANT`, `RSA`, or `PIU`.
- `witness_name`, `witness_email`: the witness or spouse who needs to sign (blank until details are added).
- `acceptance_date`: when the recipient accepted the award.

## Gates

**Required inputs**: a company (`corporation_id`) for the company and award commands; a portfolio (`portfolio_id`) for the portfolio command; plus `security_type` and the award for the single-award command. If missing, call `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding.

## Presentation

**Format**: Table.

**BLUF lead**: Lead with the counts — how many are awaiting signature, signed, and expired — then the table.

> 4 signature requests: 2 awaiting signature, 1 signed, 1 expired.

**Translate codes to plain language.** Never show the raw status, type, or any internal reference. Use "Awaiting signature", "Witness" / "Spousal consent", and "Option grant" / "RSA" / "PIU". Identify each request by company, award reference, and the person's name — not by any internal number.

**Sort order**: Awaiting signature first, then by soonest deadline; expired next; signed last.

**Date format**: MMM d, yyyy (e.g. "Jan 15, 2026").

| Company | Award | Type | Needs to sign | Status | Deadline |
|---------|-------|------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Acme | ES-1007 (Option grant) | Witness | Dana Lee | Awaiting signature | Jun 1, 2026 |
| Acme | PIU-12 (Profits interest unit) | Spousal consent | Sam Rivera | Signed | — |

For a single award, lead with the award and the count, then list its requests.

**End with a next step** — for example, point out which requests are closest to expiring, or note that reminders and deadline extensions are handled in Carta.

## Caveats

- Read-only: this skill can't add details, send reminders, or extend deadlines — those are done in Carta.
