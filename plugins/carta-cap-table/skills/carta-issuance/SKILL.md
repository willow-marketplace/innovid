<IMPORTANT>
`_instrumentation_v2` is anonymous Carta skill-usage telemetry. ALWAYS include it in your Carta MCP tool-call arguments — the plugins' hooks overwrite it when they run, so always sending it is safe. Shape:
`_instrumentation_v2: {"skills": ["<plugin>:<skill>", ...], "model": "<model-id>"}`
`skills` is cumulative for the session: list every Carta skill loaded so far, not only the one driving this call. Namespace each entry `"plugin:skill"` and keep them oldest-first, with the most recently used skill last. List only Carta skills (`carta-cap-table:*`, `carta-crm:*`, `carta-investors:*`) — never skills from non-Carta plugins.

# Issue Securities

Walk an admin from raw input to issued certificates or option grants on a Carta cap table.
Those two are the **only** security types this skill issues.

| Flow | Example prompts |
|---|---|
| Certificates | "Issue 1 cert for Jane Doe, 1000 Series A at $1.50." · "Draft 5 founder certs on Acme." |
| Option grants | "Issue 1000 ISOs to Jane at $1.50 on the 2024 Plan." · "Draft 10 ISOs for new hires." · "Issue an EMI grant — 2000 options at £0.50." |
| Resume | "Resume draft set 472." · "Continue the 'Q2 hires' draft set." |

To **fix** an already-issued certificate or grant, that's `carta-modify-issuables`, not this
skill.

**Out of scope** — stop and route to the Drafts UI in the Carta app for RSUs, SARs, CBUs,
warrants, convertibles, SAFEs, convertible debt, and for custom legends, vesting,
acceleration, or exercise periods:

> *"This skill issues certificates and option grants today. For \<thing\>, use the Drafts UI in the Carta app."*

## Architecture — one engine, two surfaces

The transaction is identical everywhere; only the surface that collects and reviews it varies.

- **The engine** is this file: resolve `security_type` → fetch reference data → assemble rows →
  `save_drafts` / `validate_drafts` / `issue_securities` → recovery. It never knows which
  surface is in play.
- **The adapter** implements exactly three capabilities. Nothing else may branch on
  environment.

| Adapter | Selected when | `collectConfig` (0.5) | `showReview` (2) | `confirm` (2→3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cowork** (primary, ~95% of usage) | `preview_start` **absent** | one `show_widget` form | chat markdown | one `AskUserQuestion` |
| **Code** | `preview_start` **present** | `render-panel` config panel | `render-panel` review panel | the panel's **Confirm & Issue** button |

**This file documents the Cowork path**, since that is nearly all real usage. If [Phase 0 Step
1](#step-1--detect-the-environment-from-the-tool-surface) selects the Code adapter, read
[code-adapter.md](references/code-adapter.md) — its **§0** lists every point where that adapter
diverges, and anything §0 does not mention behaves exactly as described here.

Read up front on every run:

- **[references/cowork-adapter.md](references/cowork-adapter.md)** — the form, the chat review,
  the confirm, and the authoritative per-block field list. Skip only if Step 1 selected Code.
- **[references/payload-reference.md](references/payload-reference.md)** — the authoritative
  field contract: types, formats, picklists, autofills, date quirks.

Both paths end the same way: the `issue_securities` mutate ([Phase 3](#phase-3--on-confirmation-run-the-mutate)).
The SDK's HITL prompt on that mutate is the final, irreversible gate — never the review gate.

---

## Hard rules

1. **The field contract lives in [payload-reference.md](references/payload-reference.md).**
   Read it before constructing any payload. No invented keys.
2. **Never mix certificate and option grant fields in one mutate.** Run the skill twice for a
   mixed request.
3. **One confirmation gate per mutate attempt** — never zero, never two stacked. On Cowork the
   gate is the `AskUserQuestion` in
   [cowork-adapter.md §3](references/cowork-adapter.md#3-confirm--one-askuserquestion); on Code
   it is the panel button, and stacking a question on an open panel suspends its submit watcher
   so the click never lands. Recovery questions after a server short-circuit are unrestricted
   on both. The SDK's HITL prompt is not this gate.
4. **Retry contract — reuse identity from the FIRST response.** `draft_set_id` from the first
   mutate goes on every subsequent `issue_securities`, `save_drafts`, `load_drafts`,
   `validate_drafts`, `resolve_duplicate_stakeholder`; omitting it makes the server auto-create
   a *second* draft set with the same incomplete rows. Each row's `draft_pk` from its first
   save goes on every retry row alongside *every* required field; omitting `draft_pk` inserts a
   new row instead of updating.
   **A timeout is not an error** — the call may have already succeeded server-side, so retrying
   with the wrong params risks a duplicate draft set or a double-issue. Read
   [payload-reference.md § Timeouts & retries](references/payload-reference.md#timeouts--retries)
   before retrying any mutate that timed out.
5. **The server is the source of truth.** Don't mirror its validation; surface its messages
   verbatim.
6. **Never delegate to a background agent.** The gates require interactive HITL.
7. **Templates only — no custom payloads** for legends, vesting, acceleration, or exercise
   periods: *"Custom \<thing\> isn't supported here. Save as draft and finish in the Drafts UI."*
8. **No id sniffing.** Required values come from user input, `cap_table:get:stakeholders` with
   `detail=full`, or a documented default — never scraped from another grant or certificate. If
   none of the three applies, ask via `AskUserQuestion`.
9. **Pre-save assertion.** Before *any* `save_drafts` or `issue_securities` call, walk every row
   and confirm each `always` field (per [Row templates](#row-templates)) holds a non-null value.
   If one is missing, recover **before** the call, in order: (a) the row template's documented
   default; (b) re-run the stakeholder lookup (`detail=full`) and re-stamp
   `issue_date_relationship` / `email` / `stakeholder_kind`; (c) `AskUserQuestion`.
   This is load-bearing because both failure modes are **silent**: `save_drafts` accepts
   incomplete rows without complaint, and at issue time a row with `stakeholder_id=null` slips
   duplicate detection, creates zero securities, and still returns success.
10. **Never ask who the grantees are before opening the collection surface.** A missing
    recipient is an empty field on the surface, never a chat question — this is the single most
    common way this skill goes wrong. Two sub-rules follow from it:
    - **A bare "N \<securities\>" is a quantity, not a headcount.** *"100 option grants"*,
      *"100 certificates"* — the server's `quantity` field counts shares/options for **one**
      recipient. With no named people and no plural-**person** language, open **one** blank
      block with `quantity` pre-filled to N (`knowns.rows = [{"quantity": "100"}]`).
    - **Only pre-render multiple blank blocks when the language counts people** — *"100
      employees"*, *"grants for 100 new hires"*, or an explicit list of names. Then build
      `knowns.rows` as that many empty dicts so the surface opens pre-sized.
    - Genuinely ambiguous (rare) → `AskUserQuestion` which one. That is a real fork, not the
      forbidden "who are the grantees" question.

The incidents behind these rules — including the ones that look redundant — are in
[references/incidents.md](references/incidents.md). Read it before weakening any of them.

---

## Voice & defaults

- **Explain anything the skill chose.** Tag `(default)`, `(from existing record)`, or
  `(autofill — <so_type> rule)` with a one-line explanation under the review. The review is the
  user's only chance to reject a default, so an unshown default is one they never got to see.
- **Silent defaults are computable; prompted fields aren't.** If the skill can stamp it
  (today's date, `issue_date + 10 years`, an autofill rule), stamp it and surface it tagged.
  Never ask twice.
- **Show the full text of legally binding values** (e.g. the legend body), not just the
  template name.
- **Dates display as `MM/DD/YYYY`** everywhere the user sees them. Payload formats follow
  [payload-reference.md](references/payload-reference.md).
- **Explain jargon on first use** (Rule 144 date, Section 4(a)(2), INDIVIDUAL, legend).
- **No raw ids or payload field names in customer-facing text — ever.** Not in headers, status
  lines, prompts, confirmations, or error renderings. Never write the word "ID"
  (✅ *"looking up Jane"* / ❌ *"pulling stakeholder id 12345"*), and never render `(<number>)`
  after a name. Translate payload keys before surfacing them, including when echoing server
  `banner_errors` back: humanize mechanically (`_` → space, Title Case), with the exceptions
  listed in [references/labels.md](references/labels.md).

---

## Resolve `security_type`

Resolve once, at the top. Pass on every draft-set tool call.

| Cue | `security_type` |
|---|---|
| "cert", "certificate", "shares", "Series A", "common" | `certificate` (default) |
| "option", "ISO", "NSO", "grant" (with plan), "EMI", "CSOP", "Unapproved", "Startup Concessions", "ESS", "Non-Concessional", "ZEPO" | `option_grant` |
| Ambiguous ("equity") | Ask with `AskUserQuestion` |
| Mixed in one prompt | Ask which to run first; run the other in a follow-up |
| Out-of-scope security | Route to the Drafts UI; stop |

---

## Phase 0 — Preflight

Four steps, in order, **all before any user interaction and before gathering any input.** Step
1 is free. Steps 2–4 are the only round trips this preflight may spend: one `ToolSearch`, one
connectivity check, one `list_accounts`.

### Step 1 — Detect the environment from the tool surface

**Look at your own available tools.** `preview_start` present → **Code** adapter;
`preview_start` absent → **Cowork** adapter. That is the whole test: free, synchronous, and
correct in both environments, because `render-panel` cannot work without `preview_start`.

Do **not** run a Bash probe, check the filesystem, or reason about what the environment "looks
like" — the tool list is ground truth. Record the selection once and reuse it for Phases 0.5
and 2. Never re-detect per surface, never drop from Code to Cowork because a panel seems slow,
and never attempt `render-panel` when `preview_start` is absent.

### Step 2 — Load every tool in ONE ToolSearch call

```
ToolSearch: "select:mcp__carta__fetch,mcp__carta__mutate,mcp__carta__welcome,mcp__carta__list_accounts"
```

`mcp__carta__` is the placeholder prefix
([Step 2a](#step-2a--carta-command-names-hardcoded-never-discovered)) — when the session's
Carta tools carry a different prefix, substitute it into the `select:` string; the names after
the prefix never change. Zero matches on the literal `mcp__carta__` names means the wrong
prefix, not a disconnected server — re-check the session's tool list before treating it as the
Step 3 stop.

One call, four tools, the complete set for the run. **`mutate` is loaded here, up front**, so
Phase 2 never has to load it after the user confirms — that would be serial latency at the
worst possible moment. On the Cowork path, add `mcp__visualize__show_widget` to the same
`select:` list if it isn't already loaded.

**Never call `discover` or `search_tools` in the hot path.** Every command name is hardcoded
below; looking up a name you already know is a pure round trip. `discover` is a debugging aid.

### Step 2a — Carta command names (hardcoded, never discovered)

Reads go through `fetch`, writes through `mutate`. The argument key is **`params`**, not
`arguments`, and command names are **colon-separated**:

```
mcp__carta__fetch({"command": "cap_table:get:<noun>",     "params": {…}})
mcp__carta__mutate({"command": "cap_table:mutate:<noun>", "params": {…}})
```

**`mcp__carta__` is a placeholder** — here, in every code block below, and in every reference
file. The real prefix is environment-dependent (`mcp__carta-test__fetch`, plugin-scoped and
UUID-suffixed connector forms all occur). Resolve it from the session's tool list and
substitute it everywhere; only the prefix varies — tool and command names never do. The one
exception: the frontmatter `allowed-tools` entries are literal grant patterns — never
substitute there.

| Purpose | Command | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Reference data for the collection surface | `cap_table:get:issuance_init` | `fetch` |
| Stakeholder lookup | `cap_table:get:stakeholders` | `fetch` |
| Load an existing set's rows | `cap_table:get:load_drafts` | `fetch` |
| List draft sets (resume by name) | `cap_table:list:draft_sets` | `fetch` |
| Cap-table totals for context math — authorized, outstanding, fully diluted, ownership % | `cap_table:get:cap_table_by_share_class` | `fetch` |
| Save rows, no validation | `cap_table:mutate:save_drafts` | `mutate` |
| Validate a saved set | `cap_table:mutate:validate_drafts` | `mutate` |
| Save + validate + dedupe + issue | `cap_table:mutate:issue_securities` | `mutate` |
| Resolve flagged duplicates | `cap_table:mutate:resolve_duplicate_stakeholder` | `mutate` |

> **The totals source has a breakdown-sounding name.** `cap_table:get:cap_table_by_share_class`
> — `corporation_id` alone — returns authorized, outstanding, fully diluted, and ownership %.
> Context math only (e.g. percent-of-fully-diluted for a grant), never a payload source. There
> is no `cap_table:get:cap_table_summary` — guessing it returns *"Unknown command"* — and the
> similar-sounding `cap_table_summary_report` is a different plugin's report command, not a
> name here; the row above is this skill's totals source.

**Go through `fetch`/`mutate`, not `call_tool`.** The runtime's tool descriptions deprecate
`fetch` in favour of `call_tool` and `discover` in favour of `search_tools`. That notice is
known and deliberately not followed — do not "fix" the contradiction. `fetch` stays because
the per-command tools `call_tool` would target are excluded from `tools/list` (the mechanics
below); the `discover` half is moot here because every command name is hardcoded in the table
above, so discovery never runs (full story:
[incidents.md § Round-trips](references/incidents.md#round-trips-that-bought-nothing)).
Both `fetch` and `mutate` are *pinned gateway* tools: always
present in `tools/list`, reachable in one hop, with scope and staff checks enforced inside the
command executor. The double-underscore form (`cap_table__mutate__issue_securities`) is not a
typo for a command name — carta-mcp also generates one hidden tool per command by swapping `:`
for `__` — but those are excluded from `tools/list` and reachable only via a
`search_tools` → `call_tool` round trip, which is the cost this skill's hot path exists to
avoid. When such a tool isn't visible to the session, that route returns *"Unknown tool"*
instead.

**Never call `set_context` for a corporation-scoped command.** Every command above takes
`corporation_id` as a direct param — pass it.

### Step 3 — Confirm Carta MCP connectivity

The whole flow depends on the Carta MCP server. If no Carta MCP tool is available (none in the
tool list, or `welcome` errors), **stop before gathering any input**:

> *"I can't reach Carta — the Carta MCP server isn't connected. Connect the Carta MCP server and try again."*

### Step 4 — Resolve the corporation by name

If the prompt named a company and you don't already have its `corporation_id`, call
`list_accounts(search="<name>")` — **never** an unfiltered `list_accounts()`, which returns a
truncated alphabetical page that may never reach the name you want. `search` is the tool's own
name lookup; don't substitute a `discover` guess for it. Only ask the user via
`AskUserQuestion` if `search` returns zero or several ambiguous matches.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Configure the issuance

Collect everything on **one** surface — every field, per stakeholder — so the user submits once
instead of answering a chain of questions, and so a single batch can carry genuinely different
terms for different people. This is the engine's `collectConfig`; the adapter from Step 1
decides what the surface is.

**Fetch the reference data first, and issue every call below in ONE assistant turn.** They have
no dependencies on each other; serial fetches here are pure latency.

- **Stakeholder lookup** — `cap_table:get:stakeholders` with `detail=full`, scoped with a
  `search=` covering the people the prompt named. `search` matches `full_name` **and** `email`.
  For several named people, issue **one** call covering them all if the gateway accepts it,
  else one per person — bounded by the number of people named, never by roster size.
  **If the prompt named nobody, make no call at all**: there is nobody to resolve yet, and
  [Phase 1](#phase-1--resolve-each-row--reconcile-share-classes) resolves whatever names the
  user types into the form.
- **Reference data** — `cap_table:get:issuance_init` with the active `security_type`. **One
  call** returns every section the surface and Phase 1 need, each with the same
  `{count, results}` shape as its standalone command:
  - *Option grant* — `vesting_templates`, `acceleration_templates`, `document_sets`,
    `valuations_409a`, `international_valuations`, `option_plans`.
  - *Certificate* — `certificate_share_classes`, `legends`, `vesting_templates`,
    `acceleration_templates` (cert vesting is opt-in but needs the same two lists once opted in).

  **Partial failure is non-fatal.** A section that failed comes back `null` and is named in the
  top-level `errors` array (`[{section, message}]`); fall back to that section's individual
  `cap_table:get:<section>` command. An empty `errors` means full success — use the payload
  directly. This is the only fallback path; the rest of this file just says "from the
  `issuance_init` payload".

  **Read each section under its own name.** Never let one section's `count: 0` stand in for
  another's. Exactly one count may stop the flow — the [Account-setup
  gate](#account-setup-gate-option-grant-only) below, on `document_sets.count` read under that
  name and no other. Every other count, zero included, never gates: the surface is built and
  opened regardless (Hard rule 10).

### Account-setup gate (option grant only)

Runs once, immediately after the `issuance_init` payload is read — before FMV, jurisdiction,
plan, or any surface work — and is skipped entirely when `security_type` is `certificate`. Both
adapters run it: a zero-template corporation cannot issue from either surface.

Read `document_sets.count` from the `document_sets` section, under that exact name. Confirm the
section name before acting on the number: a real run aborted a valid issuance by reading
`acceleration_templates`' zero as this section's ([incidents.md § Reading server data
wrong](references/incidents.md#reading-server-data-wrong)). Then branch:

- **`count >= 1`** → pass; continue the phase. No other section's count matters here —
  `acceleration_templates.count: 0`, or any other empty list, is a normal state and never gates.
- **`count == 0`** → stop before building any surface:

  > *"Your corporation doesn't have any option-grant document templates set up yet. Create one in the Carta app, then come back."*

- **`document_sets` failed to fetch** — `null` (named in the top-level `errors` or not), absent
  outright, or present but not the documented `{count, results}` shape (missing or non-numeric
  `count`) → a failed fetch, **not** `count: 0`. Run the section's fallback,
  `cap_table:get:document_sets` with `security_type: "option_grant"`, and gate on that count
  instead. If the fallback errors too, surface its message verbatim and stop as a fetch failure
  — never with the no-templates message above.

**Why stopping here doesn't break Hard rule 10.** Rule 10 forbids asking for *collectible
fields* — anything the surface has a field for, like who the grantees are — before the surface
opens. The surface's document-set field picks **among existing templates**; it cannot create
one. Every grant row requires one (`document_set_id` is an `always` field), so with zero
templates the field is unfillable from any surface and the batch it collects can never issue. A
missing template is an **account-setup blocker** — the same category as an unreachable Carta MCP
(Phase 0 Step 3) — and account setup happens in the Carta app, not on this surface.

**The gate has exactly one member: `document_sets`, on option grants.** It is not a "stop on any
empty section" rule and must not be read as one.

### Option grant: resolve the FMV and the jurisdiction (before building the surface)

Both are batch-level: every row in one draft set shares them. Resolve once, pass in `knowns`.

**The FMV is not "the 409A".** A company outside the US prices grants from an EMI, CSOP or
share-price valuation and may have no 409A at all — reading only `valuations_409a` is what left
those admins with an empty exercise price. Prefer `international_valuations`, which covers every
source *including* 409A and carries the currency and status that `valuations_409a` cannot.

Read `international_valuations.active` (already filtered to live valuations server-side — do
**not** re-derive it from dates) and set:

| `knowns` key | Value |
|---|---|
| `fmv_options` | the `active` rows as-is (`price`, `currency`, `valuation_type`, `effective_date`) |
| `fmv_source` | the rows' shared `support_reference_type` (`409A` / `EMI` / `CSOP` / `SHARE_PRICE`) |
| `fmv_expired_on` | only when `active` is empty and `history` has one — its `expiration_date`, so the hint can say *when* cover lapsed instead of just "none" |

`build_config.py` derives the hint and the prefill from these; don't pre-compute either.

> **Never pick between two active valuations.** An HMRC report yields both an **AMV** (actual
> market value, discounted for restrictions) and a **UMV** (unrestricted market value). Nothing
> in the payload says which one a grant is priced from, and the difference changes the holder's
> tax position — so pass both and let the panel ask. The panel deliberately leaves the field
> empty in that case; do not "help" by filling one in.

**If the section is missing** — a US-only corp can be refused it (it is permissioned separately),
in which case it comes back `null` in `errors`. Fall back to `valuations_409a`: use
`current_409a` when its `is_expired` is false, and treat `is_expired: true` as the expired case.

**Derive `knowns.jurisdiction` too** — `build_config.py` defaults it to `"US"`, which shows a UK
company ISO/NSO buttons instead of EMI/CSOP. In precedence order:

1. the active valuation's `currency` (`GBP` → UK, `AUD` → AU, `USD` → US);
2. `option_plans[].scheme_type == "EMI"` → UK;
3. an `EMI`/`CSOP` `support_reference_type` in the valuations payload → UK;
4. otherwise `US` — and say so in the review as `(default — assumed US)`, so a wrong guess is
   visible and correctable rather than silent.

Set `knowns.currency` from the same source. See
[code-adapter.md § knowns](references/code-adapter.md#1-config-panel-build_configpy-builds-every-block).

**The surface's fields** — one full key-value block per stakeholder, every field inside that
person's own block, so a batch can issue genuinely different terms to different people. The
authoritative enumeration for both adapters is
[cowork-adapter.md § Fields](references/cowork-adapter.md#fields); it also covers batch mode
(shared terms once + a compact name/email/quantity table) for large identical-term batches.

Render the form with `show_widget` and wait for its `sendPrompt()` reply —
[cowork-adapter.md §1](references/cowork-adapter.md#1-collectconfig--the-show_widget-form).
**Never express this as a chain of `AskUserQuestion`s**: it is an option-picker that cannot take
a free-text quantity, price, date, or name, so one prompt per field is the exact serial
interrogation this phase exists to eliminate. Reserve `AskUserQuestion` for genuinely blocking
single choices — an ambiguous `security_type`, a multi-plan pick, the Phase 2 confirm.

**On submit**, take the returned `rows` as your working set and map each row's own fields onto
a resolved row: [references/row-mapping.md](references/row-mapping.md). Then go to Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1 — Resolve each row + reconcile share classes

Your working set is the `rows` from Phase 0.5 — one entry per grantee/holder, each already
carrying its own quantity and full field set. Phase 1 *resolves* each row; it does **not**
re-collect the person, the quantity, or any field the surface already carries.

**Resolve from what Phase 0.5 already fetched.** Match each `rows[].name` case-insensitively
against the targeted `search` results, which carry `name`/`full_name`, `email`, `id`, `kind`,
and `event_relationship` per person:

- **Exactly one match** → reuse `email`, `event_relationship`, `kind`, `id`. Stamp
  `stakeholder_id` to bypass duplicate detection. Tag `(from existing record)`. **No MCP call.**
- **No match** → the person is new, or was typed into the form after Phase 0.5 fetched (routine
  on Cowork). Batch *only these misses* into **one** `cap_table:get:stakeholders` call whose
  `search` covers them all, else one per miss. A genuine no-match is a new stakeholder — never
  ask for an email that is already on the cap table.
- **Multiple matches on one name** → disambiguate with `AskUserQuestion`.

> **The number of stakeholder calls is bounded by roster misses, never by row count.** A
> per-name `search` loop is the serial round-trip pattern this skill was slow for — and
> concatenating every row's name into one `OR`-ed `search` to make that loop look batched is the
> same bug wearing a disguise.

**Precedence for the two fields the surface can also supply:** a non-empty `relationship`
stamps `issue_date_relationship`, and `stakeholder_kind` (defaulting to `INDIVIDUAL`) stamps
itself — but **only when the lookup found no match**. For an existing stakeholder the cap-table
record always wins; the surface auto-populates and locks these on an exact name match precisely
so the two agree. Tag `(from config surface — new stakeholder)`.

Dropping any of `email`, `issue_date_relationship`, `stakeholder_kind`, or `stakeholder_id`
from a stamped row is a contract violation (Hard rule 9).

**Push back on parsing only** — a required field empty, a quantity that isn't a parseable
number, a date that doesn't parse (ask for `YYYY-MM-DD` or `MM/DD/YYYY`), a broken email shape,
or a required price that is `0`/blank, *except* the two legitimate `0` cases: a **ZEPO** grant
and a **certificate/RSA on an LLC**. Everything else is the server's call — don't pre-validate
price-vs-FMV, decimals, future dates, negatives, state codes, exemption picklists, or prefix
format.

### Share-class reconciliation (certificate)

Matching a user-supplied class name, the "most recently created" default, and the
ambiguous-match table: [certificate-fields.md § Share-class
reconciliation](references/certificate-fields.md#share-class-reconciliation-certificate).

### Option-plan reconciliation (option grant)

Use the `option_plans` section from the Phase 0.5 `issuance_init` payload.

- **One non-expired plan** → default silently. Tag `(default — only active plan)`.
- **Multiple non-expired** → `AskUserQuestion`, one option per plan
  (`"Use \"<name>\" (<available_quantity> available)"`), last option `"Cancel"`.
- Skip expired plans (`is_expired: true`); **never recompute** `available_quantity`.

Pass `equity_plan_id` **only on the first mutate** that creates the set — it is locked
server-side after. Also stamp the chosen plan's `name` onto every row as `plan_name`, a
[review-only field](references/option-grant-fields.md#review-only-fields-option-grant--never-sent-to-the-mutate)
never sent to the mutate.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Save + validate before review (or save-only)

Reached immediately after Phase 1 resolves every row, for **both** of the surface's footer
buttons. Saving and validating *before* the review exists is deliberate: `validate_drafts` runs
nearly every check `issue_securities` does — all but the corp-level missing-signatory check —
and it needs an existing `draft_set_id`, so validating early means saving early too. Reviewing
an unvalidated summary means the user first learns of a rejection at the final confirm, after a
draft row has already been created.

Full mechanics — branching on `save_only` / `config_submit`, translating server errors back
into `knowns`, re-rendering the surface, and draft-state bookkeeping:
[references/save-validate-flow.md](references/save-validate-flow.md).

## Resume an existing draft set

Loading a set by id or name, re-deriving option-grant review-only display fields, and jumping
straight to Phase 2: [references/resume-flow.md](references/resume-flow.md#resume-an-existing-draft-set).

---

## Shared resolution helpers

The collection surface already gathers legend, vesting, acceleration, and document set as
fields inside each stakeholder's block, so on a normal run the row arrives already carrying the
resolved id/label and **these procedures don't run**. They are the fallback for anything the
surface didn't resolve. Picklist source, default posture, and what gets stamped are identical
either way.

Board approval is the exception to "the surface already did this": it *is* a surface field, but
the pointed-to section documents the underlying `needs_board_approval` logic both paths
converge on. Dividend accrual start date is a further exception — it has no surface field at
all yet and always goes through chat.

### Vesting resolution

Use the `vesting_templates` section from the Phase 0.5 `issuance_init` payload. Render a
compact picker (name + `summary_short` + `vesting_type`). `AskUserQuestion`: one option per
template → `vesting_template: <id>`; `"No vesting"` → leave unset. When set, also collect
`vesting_start_date` (`MM/DD/YYYY`, default `issue_date`) **unless** the template's
`vesting_type` is milestone, which the server defaults — skip that prompt.

| Flow | Default posture | "No vesting" |
|---|---|---|
| Certificate | Opt-in (only if the user volunteers) | Normal |
| Option grant | Required server-side | Accepted, but warn — atypical |

### Acceleration resolution

Only if vesting is set. Use the `acceleration_templates` section from the `issuance_init`
payload. `AskUserQuestion`: one option per template → `acceleration_template: <id>`;
`"No acceleration"` → leave unset.

### Type-specific helpers

- **Legend** (certificate) — [certificate-fields.md § Legend
  resolution](references/certificate-fields.md#legend-resolution-certificate).
- **Dividend accrual start date** (certificate) —
  [certificate-fields.md](references/certificate-fields.md#dividend-accrual-start-date-resolution).
- **Rule 144 difference reason** (certificate, only when `rule_144_date` ≠ `issue_date`) —
  [certificate-fields.md](references/certificate-fields.md#rule-144-difference-reason).
- **Exercise periods, document set, board approval** (option grant) —
  [option-grant-fields.md § Resolution
  helpers](references/option-grant-fields.md#resolution-helpers-option-grant).

---

## Row templates

Fill literally. Every slot must hold a value before review; a `None` or empty is a skill bug —
reapply the default, re-call the stakeholder lookup, or ask (Hard rule 9). Each file also lists
the **review-only** fields stamped alongside the payload, which are display-only and never sent
to the mutate.

- **Certificate** — [certificate-fields.md § Certificate
  row](references/certificate-fields.md#certificate-row).
- **Option grant** — [option-grant-fields.md § Option-grant
  row](references/option-grant-fields.md#option-grant-row).

## Pre-mutate checklist

Tick before any mutate — Phase 1.5's `save_drafts` / `validate_drafts` included, not just the
final `issue_securities`:

- [ ] `security_type` resolved and passed on every call
- [ ] Stakeholder lookup ran with `detail=full` → `issue_date_relationship`, `email`, `stakeholder_kind`, `stakeholder_id` stamped on every row
- [ ] **Cert:** share class resolved → `prefix`. **Grant:** option plan resolved, `so_type` autofills applied (`currency`, `exemption`)
- [ ] Every `always` field populated per the row template; pre-save assertion passed (Hard rule 9)
- [ ] **For `issue_securities` only:** the review surface was opened and confirmed (Phase 2 → 3). Phase 1.5's calls precede the review by design, so this doesn't apply to them
- [ ] If retry: `draft_set_id` + each row's `draft_pk` in the payload (Hard rule 4)

---

## Phase 2 — Render the review surface (mandatory pre-save gate)

The engine's `showReview` + `confirm`. Phase 1.5 has already saved and validated these rows, so
this is a **read-only** confirmation before the irreversible `issue_securities` call, not
another save.

Print the review as chat markdown, then confirm with one `AskUserQuestion` —
[cowork-adapter.md §2–3](references/cowork-adapter.md#2-showreview--chat-markdown). The full
always/conditional/optional column spec, the default-explanation text, the confirm prompt, and
the compressed format for identical-term batches are in
[references/chat-review.md](references/chat-review.md).

> **Tool pre-load:** `mutate` must already be loaded (Phase 0 batched it) before you open this
> surface. Do not `ToolSearch` here — it adds serial latency after the user has confirmed. If
> for any reason it isn't loaded, load it now, *before* rendering the review.

---

## Phase 3 — On confirmation, run the mutate

You reach Phase 3 when the review surface confirms. **The confirmation already happened — do
not re-ask**, and don't second-guess a fresh signal as a stale replay. Branch directly:

| Answer | Do |
|---|---|
| `"Issue … now"` / any free-text affirmative | [Run the issue securities mutate](#run-the-issue-securities-mutate) |
| `"Save as draft"` | [Save as draft](#save-as-draft-escape-hatch) |
| `"Edit a row"` | re-render the Phase 0.5 form, pre-filled with the resolved rows |
| `"Cancel"` | stop — *Canceled* closing |

### Build the mutate payload from your Phase-1-resolved rows

The review is read-only and has nothing to merge back. Build the `drafts` array directly from
your Phase-1-resolved rows, using the [Row templates](#row-templates) key list **only**.

- **Strip every review-only field first.** `plan_name`, `document_set_label`,
  `exercise_periods_text`, and `legend_body` live on the same resolved-row dict as the payload
  fields; sending one makes the server reject the mutate with an unknown-field error.
- **CharField dates** (`grant_expiration_date`, `vesting_start_date`, `rule_144_date`) should
  already be `MM/DD/YYYY` from Phases 0.5/1 — confirm before the mutate.

Re-run the pre-save assertion (Hard rule 9) on the resolved rows, then mutate.

## Run the issue securities mutate

One mutate runs save → validate → check duplicates → issue, atomically.

```
# Certificate
mcp__carta__mutate({"command": "cap_table:mutate:issue_securities", "params": {
  "corporation_id": <corporation_id>, "security_type": "certificate",
  "drafts": [ ...cert rows... ],
  "draft_set_id": <draft_set_id on retry/resume>,   # omit on first call
  "draft_set_name": <optional label, ≤30 chars>}})

# Option grant — additionally pass equity_plan_id on the FIRST call only
mcp__carta__mutate({"command": "cap_table:mutate:issue_securities", "params": {
  "corporation_id": <corporation_id>, "security_type": "option_grant",
  "drafts": [ ...grant rows... ],
  "equity_plan_id": <equity_plan_id>,               # first call only
  "draft_set_id": <draft_set_id on retry/resume>}})
```

**Response:** `{draft_set_id, drafts:[{temp_id, draft_pk, status}], validation:{status, success,
errors, warnings}, duplicates:{has_duplicates, count, results}, issued:[{id}]|null}`. **Always
capture `draft_set_id` and each `draft_pk`**, even on success — a follow-up may retry this
conversation.

| Response state | Action |
|---|---|
| `issued` non-empty | Committed — render the table per [On success](#on-success) |
| `validation.errors` | [mutate-recovery.md § Error recovery](references/mutate-recovery.md#error-recovery) |
| `duplicates.has_duplicates` | [mutate-recovery.md § Duplicate resolution](references/mutate-recovery.md#duplicate-resolution) |
| Only `validation.warnings` (`issued: null`) | Surface verbatim; `AskUserQuestion`: `"Acknowledge and issue"` / `"Edit a row"`; re-call on acknowledge |
| Issue failed / 403 | [mutate-recovery.md § Atomic issue failure](references/mutate-recovery.md#atomic-issue-failure) |

Every re-call carries `draft_set_id` + each `draft_pk` (Hard rule 4).

### On success

Render a short table using `MM/DD/YYYY`. Don't fabricate `Label` or `Grant number` columns —
they aren't in the response.

- **Certificate:** Stakeholder · Share class · Quantity · Issue date.
- **Option grant:** Stakeholder · Plan · Option type · Quantity · Exercise price · Issue date.

Link to the ledger at `https://app.carta.com/<VIEW_URL_PATH>`, where `VIEW_URL_PATH` is
`options/list/<CORP_ID>/` (option grant) or `certificates/list/<CORP_ID>/` (certificate).
**Never invent a different path** — `corporations/<corporation_id>/equity/options/` looks
plausible and is not a real route. `app.carta.com` is a deliberate hardcode: no MCP command
resolves an environment-specific host, so this link is only correct in production and will
misdirect a sandbox/test session — a known, accepted tradeoff, not an oversight. There is no
verified URL for a specific plan's detail page, so name the plan in plain text, not as a second
link. Then close per [Closing](#closing).

## Save as draft (escape hatch)

Runs whenever a save-only save is needed: from [Phase 1.5](#phase-15--save--validate-before-review-or-save-only)'s
**Save** button (the common case), or from the Phase 3 answer `"Save as draft"`.

```
mcp__carta__mutate({"command": "cap_table:mutate:save_drafts", "params": {
  "corporation_id": <corporation_id>, "security_type": "<certificate|option_grant>",
  "drafts": [ ...rows... ],
  "draft_set_id": <draft_set_id if resuming>, "draft_set_name": <optional, ≤30 chars>,
  "equity_plan_id": <equity_plan_id>}})   # option-grant only, on first save
```

Response `{draft_set_id, drafts:[{temp_id, draft_pk, status}]}` — no top-level `validation`
(`save_drafts` skips it by design), **but each row's `status` still reflects its own save.**
Check it:

- **All success** → the *Saved as draft* closing.
- **Some errored** → surface verbatim per failing `draft_pk`, recover via
  [mutate-recovery.md](references/mutate-recovery.md#error-recovery), then re-call
  `save_drafts` (**not** `issue_securities`) with the same `draft_set_id` + each `draft_pk`.
- **All failed** → surface verbatim; *"No drafts saved. Fix the errors above and re-try."* — no
  Drafts-UI link, since there is nothing there to open.

**Never show the success message when any row failed** — the user would believe a partial set
is complete.

## Validate without issuing

```
mcp__carta__mutate({"command": "cap_table:mutate:validate_drafts", "params": {
  "corporation_id": <corporation_id>, "security_type": "<certificate|option_grant>",
  "draft_set_id": <draft_set_id>}})
```

Returns `{validation, duplicates}` only. Interpret with the branching rules above; stop at the
report.

## Cleanup unexpected draft rows

Extra or duplicate rows surfaced by `load_drafts` on resume, or a dropped `row_key` from a
Phase 1.5 retry: [resume-flow.md § Cleanup unexpected draft
rows](references/resume-flow.md#cleanup-unexpected-draft-rows).

---

## Closing

At a terminal state, lead with a one-line domain summary — company, count, type, and for an
issue, the issue date in long form (`Month D, YYYY`).

| State | Template |
|---|---|
| Issued, certificate | *"N \<share class\> certificates issued on \<company\> — \<issue date\>. Open [\<company\>'s securities ledger](https://app.carta.com/\<VIEW_URL_PATH\>) in Carta to see the new certificates."* |
| Issued, grant (uniform) | *"N \<so_type\> option grants issued on \<company\> — \<issue date\>. Open [\<company\>'s securities ledger](https://app.carta.com/\<VIEW_URL_PATH\>) in Carta to see the new grants, or find them under the \<plan name\> plan."* |
| Issued, grant (mixed) | as above, but *"N option grants (X ISOs, Y NSOs) issued on …"* |
| Saved as draft | *"N \<security type\> drafts saved on \<company\> — finish in the [Drafts UI](https://app.carta.com/drafts/\<security_type\>/\<CORP_ID\>/draft/?draftSetPk=\<draft_set_id\>)."* |
| Canceled, **a real draft set exists** | *"Issuance canceled on \<company\> — the draft set is still there if you want to come back to it: [Drafts UI](…same URL…)."* |
| Canceled, **no real draft set** | *"Issuance canceled on \<company\> — nothing was saved to Carta."* (no link — there is nothing to open) |

A draft set is **real** when this batch was resumed from an existing one, **or** at least one
row from a `save_drafts` / `issue_securities` call this session came back with a success
`status` and therefore a saved `draft_pk`. It is **not** real when `draft_set_id` is still the
initial `"new"` placeholder, or when every row's `status` came back an error.

Every link above hardcodes `app.carta.com` — no MCP command resolves an environment-specific
host, so this is only correct in production. A deliberate, accepted tradeoff: a sandbox/test
session gets a link pointing at production. `security_type` in a Drafts-UI path is the
literal mutate value (`certificate` or `option_grant`).

To **correct** an issued certificate or grant afterward, that's `carta-modify-issuables`.
