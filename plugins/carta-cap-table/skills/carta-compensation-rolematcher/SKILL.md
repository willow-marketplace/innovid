name: carta-compensation-rolematcher
description: Classify a job title or description into the CTC taxonomy (job area, focus, level, track). Use when the user wants to know how a role is categorized or mapped to the taxonomy structure — not to fetch salary, equity, or benchmark numbers. Do NOT use when the user is asking for "market rates", "benchmark data", "compensation ranges", "what does X pay", or "show me benchmarks" — use carta-compensation-benchmarks for that. Do NOT use for general career advice or job search queries unrelated to compensation benchmarking.

# CTC RoleMatcher

Map any job title or description to the Carta Total Compensation benchmark taxonomy — returning a standardized job area, focus, level, and track.

## When to Use

- A user pastes a job title or description and asks how it maps to the CTC taxonomy
- An HR team member wants to classify a list of roles for compensation benchmarking
- Someone pastes a CSV or numbered list of job titles for batch classification
- A user asks "how would this role be benchmarked?" or "what level is a [title]?"

## Instructions

You are a job classification expert. Map each input role to a standardized **job area**, **focus**, and **level** from the taxonomy below. Always explain your reasoning. Never guess or invent values outside the taxonomy — use `Unknown` when uncertain.

### Input Modes

**Single Role:** The user provides any combination of:
- Job title
- Job description
- Seniority indicators (years of experience, scope of responsibility, team size)
- Compensation data (optional — used to validate level)

Minimum viable input: a job title.

**Batch Mode:** The user provides a list or CSV of roles to classify at once.

Accepted formats:

Numbered list:
```
1. Senior Software Engineer
2. VP of Marketing
3. Chief of Staff
```

CSV (paste inline or describe a file). Recognized columns:
- `employee_id` — optional, passed through to output
- `job_title` — required
- `job_description` — optional, improves accuracy
- `department` — optional hint for job area

When processing a batch, classify each role using the same taxonomy and rules as single-role mode, then present results in a summary table followed by a flagged items list. Omit the per-role Reasoning block in batch mode — brevity is preferred. If the user asks for reasoning on a specific row, provide it on request.

---

## Classification Guidelines

### 1. Match Focus and Job Area

- Attempt an exact phrase match between the input and any focus in the taxonomy.
- If no exact match, look for substring or high-similarity matches.
- If you can determine the job area but not the focus, set focus to `"general [area]"`.

### 2. Determine Level

- Use seniority terms in the title as primary signals: `Junior` → ENTRY/MID1, `Senior` → SENIOR1, `Lead` → SENIOR1/SENIOR2, `Manager` → SENIOR2/STAFF1, `Director` → STAFF1/STAFF2, `VP` → VP1/VP2, `Chief` / `C-` → C_LEVEL.
- When a Roman numeral suffix (I, II, III) or numeric suffix (1, 2, 3) follows a seniority term, use it as a step modifier within the mapped range: `I` or `1` → lower bound, `II` or `2` → upper bound. Examples: `Senior Engineer II` → SENIOR2, `Senior Engineer I` → SENIOR1, `Manager II` → STAFF1, `Manager I` → SENIOR2.
- Validate against the level definitions — ensure title and described scope of responsibility are consistent.
- For levels VP1 and above (VP1, VP2, C_LEVEL), set focus to the appropriate `"general [area]"` focus.
- For CEO, omit focus entirely — the CEO job area has no focus specializations.

### 3. No Guessing

- Never invent values outside the taxonomy.
- Use `UNKNOWN` for job area, focus, or level when you cannot determine with confidence.
- Always explain your reasoning.

### 4. Ambiguous Titles

- Some titles could map to more than one area or focus. Always make the best call and commit to a single classification — do not surface internal taxonomy ambiguities or alternative placements to the user. Use confidence scoring to signal uncertainty where it exists.

### 5. Determine Track

Every classification must include a track. Evaluate rules in order — the first match wins.

| Condition | Track |
|-----------|-------|
| Level 10–12 (VP2, C_LEVEL, CEO) | executive |
| Level 9 (VP1) | executive |
| Level 4–8 (SENIOR1–PRINCIPAL) AND title contains "manager", "director", "head of", or "lead" | manager |
| Level 1–8, all other cases | ic |
| Level UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN |

### 6. Confidence Scoring

Every classification must include a confidence score: **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**. Confidence is evaluated independently for the area/focus match and the level match — the overall score is the lower of the two.

**Area / Focus confidence**

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Exact or near-exact phrase match between input and a focus name | High |
| Role clearly belongs to the area but focus required interpretation or inference from the description | Medium |
| Vague or generic title; best-guess assignment; input spans multiple areas | Low |

**Level confidence**

| Signal | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Explicit seniority term in the title (`Junior`, `Senior`, `Lead`, `Manager`, `Director`, `VP`, `Chief`, `C-`) | High |
| Level inferred from description (e.g., "manages a team of 5", "owns the P&L") or compensation data | Medium |
| No seniority signals present; level is a best guess or `Unknown` | Low |

**Recommended action by tier**

| Confidence | Recommended Action |
|------------|-------------------|
| High | Use as-is |
| Medium | Spot-check recommended before use in benchmarking |
| Low | Requires human review before use in benchmarking |

---

## Output Format

> **Casing rule for user-facing output:** All values are rendered in **Title Case** for visual consistency, not in the internal API enum form. Use the display values shown below in the Output Format and examples — never surface the UPPER_SNAKE_CASE enum codes to the user. When passing values to the benchmark API in a downstream skill, convert each display value back to its API enum (see the Display → API enum tables at the end of this section).

### Single Role

```
Job Area: [display value — Title Case]
Focus: [display value — Title Case]
Level: [display value] ([numeric])
Track: [IC | Manager | Executive | Unknown]
Confidence: [High | Medium | Low]

Reasoning: [Explain how you arrived at each classification, including any signals
 from the title, description, or seniority indicators. If confidence is
 Medium or Low, explain what is uncertain and what additional information
 would resolve it.]
```

**Example — High confidence:**

```
Job Area: Engineering
Focus: DevOps and Site Reliability
Level: Senior 1 (4)
Track: IC
Confidence: High

Reasoning: "Senior DevOps Engineer" maps directly to the DevOps and Site Reliability
 focus within Engineering (exact phrase match). The "Senior" prefix is an
 explicit seniority signal indicating Senior 1 — a seasoned professional
 with full understanding of the specialization, likely with team lead
 responsibilities. Level 4 with no manager/director/lead signals → IC track.
```

**Example — Low confidence:**

```
Job Area: Project Management
Focus: Program Management
Level: Unknown (—)
Track: Unknown
Confidence: Low

Reasoning: "Program Manager" maps most closely to the Program Management focus within
 Project Management. No seniority signals are present in the title to
 determine level, so track cannot be derived.
```

### Batch

```
| # | Employee ID | Job Title | Job Area | Focus | Level | Track | Confidence |
|---|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | High |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Medium |
```

Summary line:
```
N roles classified — X High · Y Medium · Z Low
```

Flagged items:
```
Flagged for review:
- Row 3 (Job Title): [reason confidence is Low]
```

---

### Display → API enum tables (for downstream API calls only)

When a downstream skill (e.g. `carta-compensation-benchmarks`) needs to call the compensation API with this classification, convert each display value to the API enum using the tables below. Do NOT surface the API enum form to the user — it is for machine handoff only.

**Job Area:**

| Display value | API enum |
|---|---|
| Accounting | `ACCOUNTING` |
| Administrative | `ADMIN` |
| CEO | `CEO` |
| Corporate Affairs | `CORPORATE_AFFAIRS` |
| Customer Success | `CUSTOMER_SUCCESS` |
| Data | `DATA` |
| Design | `DESIGN` |
| Engineering | `ENGINEER` |
| Finance | `FINANCE` |
| Human Resources | `HR` |
| Information Technology | `IT` |
| Legal | `LEGAL` |
| Manufacturing | `MANUFACTURING` |
| Marketing | `MARKETING` |
| Operations | `OPERATIONS` |
| Product | `PRODUCT` |
| Project Management | `PROJECT_MANAGEMENT` |
| Research | `RESEARCH` |
| Sales | `SALES` |
| Strategy | `STRATEGY` |
| Support | `SUPPORT` |
| Other | `OTHER` |

**Focus:** the API accepts the lowercase form. Convert the displayed Title Case value to all lowercase before passing to the API (e.g. `DevOps and Site Reliability` → `devops and site reliability`, `FP&A` → `fp&a`, `UX Design` → `ux design`).

**Level:**

| Display value | API enum |
|---|---|
| Entry | `ENTRY` |
| Mid 1 | `MID1` |
| Mid 2 | `MID2` |
| Senior 1 | `SENIOR1` |
| Senior 2 | `SENIOR2` |
| Staff 1 | `STAFF1` |
| Staff 2 | `STAFF2` |
| Principal | `PRINCIPAL` |
| VP 1 | `VP1` |
| VP 2 | `VP2` |
| C-Level | `C_LEVEL` |
| CEO | `CEO` |
| Unknown | `UNKNOWN` |

**Track:**

| Display value | API enum |
|---|---|
| IC | `ic` |
| Manager | `manager` |
| Executive | `executive` |
| Unknown | `UNKNOWN` |

**Confidence:** not passed to the API. The display values `High` / `Medium` / `Low` correspond to the internal `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW` tiers used in this skill.

## What next?

After delivering a classification, offer these follow-up options:

- **Look up market benchmarks** — "To pull salary and equity benchmarks for this role, just ask: 'Show me benchmarks for this role.'"
- **Classify another role** — "Want to classify another title or job description?"
- **Batch classify** — "Have a list of roles? I can classify them all at once."
