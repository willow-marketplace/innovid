description: Fetch 409A valuation history and current fair market value (FMV) for a company. Use when asked about 409A valuations, FMV, exercise prices, common stock price, or valuation expiration dates. Do NOT use for cross-portfolio FMV comparisons across companies — prefer a portfolio-benchmarks skill.

# 409A Valuation History

Fetch 409A fair market value (FMV) history for a company.

## When to Use

- "What's the current 409A valuation?"
- "Show me the FMV history"
- "When does the 409A expire?"
- "What's the exercise price for common stock?"
- "Has the FMV changed recently?"
- "Is the 409A valuation still valid?"

## Prerequisites

You need the `corporation_id`. Get it from `list_accounts` if you don't have it.

## Data Retrieval

```
call_tool({"name": "cap_table__get__409a_valuations", "arguments": {"corporation_id": corporation_id}})
```

Optional params:
- `share_class_id`: filter to a specific share class
- `report_id`: filter to a specific valuation report

### Response Format

JSON array of FMV records:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 484,
    "effective_date": "04/25/2024",
    "expiration_date": "04/24/2025",
    "stale_date": null,
    "price": "12.610000000000",
    "report_id": 472,
    "share_class_id": 9,
    "name": "Common",
    "common": true,
    "corporation_id": 7
  }
]
```

## Key Fields

- `effective_date`: date the 409A valuation became effective
- `expiration_date`: date the valuation expires (typically 1 year after effective)
- `stale_date`: date after which the valuation is considered stale (if applicable)
- `price`: FMV per share as a string (e.g. `"12.610000000000"`)
- `name`: share class name (e.g. "Common")
- `common`: true if this is the common stock FMV
- `report_id`: ID of the 409A report
- `share_class_id`: ID of the share class

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Fetch Valuations

```
call_tool({"name": "cap_table__get__409a_valuations", "arguments": {"corporation_id": corporation_id}})
```

### Step 2 — Identify Current Valuation

Sort by `effective_date` descending. The most recent entry is the current 409A — highlight it.

### Step 3 — Check Expiration

- If `expiration_date` is within 90 days of today — **flag as a time-sensitive action item**, not just a data point: bold it, call out the exact days remaining, and recommend initiating renewal immediately (especially if a financing round is in progress, as closing will likely push past the expiry date).
- If `expiration_date` is in the past — flag as "expired".

### Step 4 — Present Results

Show the history table and trend summary (see Presentation section).

## Gates

**Required inputs**: `corporation_id`.
If missing, call `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding (see carta-interaction-reference §4.1).

**AI computation**: No — this skill presents Carta data directly.

## Presentation

**Format**: Table + trend summary

**BLUF lead**: Lead with the current FMV per share and its effective/expiration dates before showing the history table.

**Sort order**: By `effective_date` descending (most recent first).

**Date format**: MMM d, yyyy (e.g. "Jan 15, 2026").

Format `price` as currency (e.g. "$12.61/share"), trimming trailing zeros.

| Effective | Expires | FMV/Share | Share Class | Status |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Apr 25, 2024 | Apr 24, 2025 | $12.61 | Common | Current |
| Mar 31, 2023 | Apr 24, 2024 | $10.33 | Common | Expired |

Do not render a bar chart for FMV history — values in mature companies cluster near the
maximum, making bars uninformative (all bars look the same width). The table is sufficient.
Instead, after the table, add a one-line trend summary:
> FMV has grown **Nx since YYYY**, with [acceleration/steady growth] since [year].

If multiple share classes exist, group by share class name in the table.

## Caveats

- The `price` field is a string with many trailing zeros — always parse and format as currency before displaying.
- A valuation with a past `expiration_date` should never be used for new grant pricing. Flag it prominently.
- The `stale_date` field may be null; when present, it indicates the valuation is considered stale before its formal expiration.
- 409A valuations are point-in-time snapshots — a material event (e.g., new financing round) can invalidate the current valuation even before its expiration date.
