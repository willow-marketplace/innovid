"""save_report_insights.py — capture a corporation's report insights.

The planner needs one figure from here: the equity pool's available shares, which
the review step shows a planned draw against. Everything else in the payload is
carried through unchanged rather than filtered, because the shape is small and a
future screen asking for `equity_refresh.num_employees` should not need a new
capture.

WHERE THE POOL FIGURE COMES FROM
`efab.available_shares` is the sum of `available` across the corporation's equity
pools, straight from the equity ledger — comp-service maps the ledger's summaries
and sums them (`GetEquityPoolSummaries.execute`), then the insights endpoint reads
that sum. Nothing here recomputes it.

AN ABSENT POOL IS NOT A POOL OF ZERO
This is the whole reason the script does more than copy a number.

The endpoint reads a CACHE that a separate out-of-band job primes, so a null means
"nobody has warmed this yet", not "this company has no shares". And a corporation
whose ledger returns NO pools sums to exactly 0 — indistinguishable, in the
payload, from a company that has a pool and has genuinely exhausted it.

Both land as absent here, never as 0. A review screen that showed "0 available"
would tell someone their plan overruns a pool that, as far as we actually know,
might be empty or might be forty million. Refusing to answer is correct; guessing
is not.
