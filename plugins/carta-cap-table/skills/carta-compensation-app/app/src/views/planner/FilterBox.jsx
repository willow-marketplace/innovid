// Describe a filter, see what it would do, then apply it.
//
// THIS BOX DOES NOT EDIT THE APP
// Every other ask box on this console spawns a Claude subprocess that edits the
// source and reloads the page, which is right for "add a P60 column". Here it is
// wrong: "show only engineering" is a filter over the rows on screen, and as a
// code change it becomes durable, invisible in the UI, and undoable only by
// asking again. So this box asks Claude for a PREDICATE and applies it as a
// filter — the same kind of thing as the preset controls beside it.
//
// NOTHING IS APPLIED UNTIL THE USER SAYS SO
// The predicate is previewed against the current cohort, and only reaches the
// filter state on Apply. The count is the whole point: a filter that silently
// drops fourteen people from a grant cycle is a wrong plan, not a rendering bug,
// so the number is shown BEFORE the change rather than discovered after.
//
// A NO-OP SAYS SO
// When a filter would change nothing, that is stated outright. A phrase that
// looks applied and did nothing is how someone concludes the box is broken.
//
// REFUSALS ARE THE FEATURE, NOT THE FAILURE
// Claude has a closed vocabulary — there is no performance field, no manager, no
// promotion history — and is told to refuse rather than reach for the nearest
// available field. A wrong guess about who is in a grant cycle is worse than an
// honest "I could not express that", because the guess is invisible.
