// The Issue-with-Claude handoff — a prompt the user pastes into their session.
//
// WHY A COPIED PROMPT RATHER THAN A BUTTON THAT ISSUES
// This console cannot write to Carta, by design and in three enforced places (see
// references/refresh-grant-issuance-handoff.md). Issuance also needs an equity
// plan, a vesting template and a document set, none of which the planner holds and
// all of which carta-issuance collects through interactive gates it explicitly
// refuses to delegate. So the handoff carries the part we DO know — who, and how
// many shares — and hands the rest to the flow built to ask for it.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT BLANK
// Vesting schedule, equity plan and exercise price. An almost-right vesting
// template issues genuinely wrong terms that no server-side check will catch, so
// the prompt says they are absent rather than guessing. This mirrors the CSV
// path's own rule: unresolved is blank, never inferred.
