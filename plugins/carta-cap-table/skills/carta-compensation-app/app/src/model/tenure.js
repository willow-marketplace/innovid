// Tenure arithmetic for the refresh planner.
//
// Pure — no React. Everything here is DERIVED: the API returns a start date and an
// end date, and the months-at-company figure is computed in the browser against
// today. That is why it is isolated in one module with tests, and why every
// surface displaying one of these numbers has to label it (see SKILL.md's
// derived-value rule).
//
// Deriving rather than capturing is deliberate. A month count baked in at capture
// time silently ages: a dashboard built in January would still claim January's
// tenure in June, and the eligibility gate it feeds would quietly admit the wrong
// people. Dates do not age; the arithmetic against "now" has to happen at render.

/** ISO date string -> Date at UTC midnight, or null if unparseable.
 *
 *  Parsed component-wise rather than via `new Date(str)`. A bare "2019-03-05" is
 *  treated as UTC by the spec but "2019-03-05T00:00:00" as LOCAL, and the roster
 *  carries both shapes depending on which capture path wrote it — so string
 *  parsing alone would shift a date by up to a day either side of the epoch
 *  depending on the reader's timezone. Month boundaries are exactly where a
 *  tenure gate flips, so that shift is not cosmetic.
