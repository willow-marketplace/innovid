# Agent Instructions

## Adding or Improving a Skill Use Case

FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS RELIGIOUSLY. After every edit you make, come back to these principles and judge critically whether you adhered to them. Fix your edits if not.

- **Only add a use case if it beats the docs.** If an agent can already serve the user by fetching the Langfuse docs, add nothing. Reserve new content for where docs fall short and the agent needs extra context. *Every addition is maintenance surface and dilutes the skill.*

- **You should almost never touch the top-level frontmatter `description` in `SKILL.md`.** It only controls whether the skill is invoked, and a user asking about a use case already mentions Langfuse or evaluation — which triggers it. Keep it short; in-skill routing handles the rest.

- **Put "when to use" guidance in exactly two places:** exactly one one-line entry per reference in the `## Use case specific references` list in `SKILL.md`, and the `description` in the reference file's frontmatter. Nowhere else — no prose routing section, no "when to use" section in the reference body. *A reference body is read only after the agent already chose to open it, so routing text there is dead weight.*

- **Every reference file's frontmatter must declare a `metadata.required_access` list** — the kinds of access an agent needs to execute that reference. Use only these tokens, and reuse them consistently across files:
  - `CODEBASE` — reads or edits the user's source code
  - `LANGFUSE_PROJECT_INTERFACE` — reaches the Langfuse project via CLI / API / MCP commands
  - `LANGFUSE_PROJECT_SCRIPT` — runs SDK code that connects to the Langfuse backend (needs network)
  - `GITHUB` — operates on GitHub via the `gh` CLI

- **Every line must earn its place.** Add only what's useful or what an agent couldn't infer on its own. Cut filler, restatements, self-explanatory steps, and anything the agent will already have from the relevant docs or task context. Keep new use-case references at 100 lines or fewer, including frontmatter; this is a maximum, if you exceed this length, you are likely producing slop.

- **Never commit code.** Link to the relevant Langfuse docs page so the agent fetches current code; use pseudo-code only for logic-specific bits. *Committed code goes stale.*

- **Be cautious with `allowed-tools`.** A tool not in the list still works — the user just grants permission the first time. Only auto-allow commands users would find a no-brainer (today: read-only langfuse-specific commands only). *A risky auto-allow can make people hesitate to install the skill at all.*

## Langfuse Skill Path Changes

When changing the path to any Langfuse skill in this repo, you must also update the corresponding path reference in the [CLI repo](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-cli) so that it points to the new location. Failing to do so will break the CLI's ability to resolve the skill.

## Plugin Version Bumps

The repo ships as a plugin to two marketplaces, each with its own manifest:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude Code)
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` (Cursor)

Both manifests have a `version` field and **must stay in lockstep** — always bump them together to the same value, in the same PR as the change.

When to bump (follow semver):
- **Patch** (`1.0.0` → `1.0.1`): bug fixes in a skill, clarifications to skill instructions, small content corrections.
- **Minor** (`1.0.0` → `1.1.0`): adding a new skill, adding meaningful new capability to an existing skill, non-breaking behavior changes.
- **Major** (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`): removing a skill, renaming a skill in a way that breaks `/skill-name` invocations, or any change that breaks how existing users interact with the plugin.

When **not** to bump:
- Typo fixes, formatting, comment-only changes.
- Changes to repo tooling, CI, or files outside the published skills (e.g. this `AGENTS.md`, READMEs, GitHub workflows).
- Internal refactors that don't change observable skill behavior.

If unsure whether a change warrants a bump, err on the side of bumping patch.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

When reviewing a PR (e.g. triggered by `@claude review`), enforce these principles:

First, read each changed file the way its runtime consumer will: these files are opened mid-task by an agent trying to do the work. Read from that seat and ask: does every line make sense here, can the agent act on it, and does it earn its place? 

Flag anything that reads as filler, hedging, restatement, meta-commentary about how the file was written, or an instruction aimed at a different audience (e.g. authoring notes like "don't duplicate the docs here" left inside a reference the runtime agent can't act on) — even when it breaks none of the specific checks below.

Then work through these specific checks:

- **Docs checked, and the addition beats them.** Search the Langfuse docs for the use case, compare the proposed content directly with your the fetched docs sources. Flag anything an agent could get from the docs; almost no product guidance should be duplicated. Prefer moving generally useful guidance to the docs and linking to it from the skill.
- **Does this need a new reference?** Flag a new reference file when extending an existing reference—or adding nothing—would serve the agent as well.
- **Is the reference ruthlessly concise?** Flag filler, self-explanatory instructions, repeated guidance, and details the agent will already have from the fetched docs or task context. New use-case references should be at most 100 lines including frontmatter; anything longer needs specific, convincing justification and should still be cut as far as possible.
- **No committed code.** Flag committed code samples that should instead link to a Langfuse docs page; pseudo-code for logic-specific bits is fine.
- **`metadata.required_access` present and correct.**
- **Routing lives in exactly two places.** Require exactly one compact `## Use case specific references` entry per reference file plus its frontmatter `description`. Flag multiple `SKILL.md` bullets pointing to the same reference, redundant prose routing, and extra prominence given to a newly added workflow.
- **Version bumps.** If published skill behavior changed, both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` must be bumped to the same version in the PR (and no bump for tooling/docs-only changes).
- **CLI path sync.** If a skill's path changed, the [CLI repo](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse-cli) reference must be updated too.

Prioritize correctness, and the read above, over pure formatting nits (whitespace, heading casing). "This line is meaningless to the reader" is never a mere nit. If the diff is clean against all of the above, say so plainly.
