# preset-cli

Use as the foundation for shell, scripting, CI/CD, and agent-driven Preset workflows through the `sup` CLI.

## Always

- CLI surface only; stay on MCP or direct API if that's what the user requested.
- Default to `--json` for automation and agent consumption.
- Keep `SUP_PRESET_API_TOKEN` / `SUP_PRESET_API_SECRET` out of command lines and shared output; use env vars or `sup config auth`, never paste secrets on the command line.
- Route push, sync, overwrite, and `--force` to `preset-cli-mutations`.
- Redact tokens and credential-bearing output in transcripts.

## Decision Rules

- Classify CLI vs MCP vs direct API intent before acting; if MCP or direct API was requested, defer to that plugin.
- Run metadata reads and explicitly requested data-returning reads (e.g. `sup sql`, `sup chart data`) on familiar workspaces directly with bounded output; for `sup sql`, this direct path requires a pure single-statement `SELECT`. Load safety policy before mutations, SQL that is not a pure single-statement `SELECT`, untrusted-source SQL, unfamiliar workspaces, or broad outputs.
- Choose output format based on the downstream consumer: `--json` for automation, `--csv` for files, default Rich for humans, `--porcelain` for shell pipelines.
- If a command group is not named on this card, load command coverage before composing commands.
- For mutating intent, stop and load `preset-cli-mutations` rather than continuing on this card. Non-`SELECT` SQL is confirmation-gated by the safety policy even when it is pasted by the user for a familiar workspace.

## Workflow Order

1. Establish install, auth, and workspace context.
2. Choose output format.
3. Classify risk (metadata read vs data-returning read vs mutation).
4. Load the focused reference for the operation.
5. Run only the safe / read command.
6. Redact output before sharing.
