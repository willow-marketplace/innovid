# preset-cli-mutations

Use for state-changing CLI operations: single-workspace writes (push, --force, --overwrite) and cross-workspace promotion (sync).

## Always

- Use `preset-cli` first to establish auth, workspace, and output context.
- CLI mutation surface only; route HTTP mutations to `preset-api-skills`.
- Preview before execution: native `--dry-run` for `sup sync run`, `sup user push`, and `sup user invite`; pull-and-diff for `sup chart push` / `sup dashboard push` / `sup dataset push` (no native `--dry-run`).
- Identify source AND target workspace explicitly before any cross-workspace operation.
- Require explicit typed user confirmation that contains the literal `--force` / `--overwrite` flag string when applicable.
- Redact tokens and credential-bearing output in transcripts.

## Decision Rules

- Distinguish single-workspace writes (`sup chart/dashboard/dataset push`) from cross-workspace sync (`sup sync run`).
- Treat `--force` and `--overwrite` as destructive flags; never invoke without explicit per-flag confirmation.
- For mutating command groups not named on this card, load command coverage and stop unless it explicitly marks the command as mutation-gated.
- Do not let CI / automation context bypass the confirmation step; refuse if no interactive operator is available.
- Route HTTP mutations to the API plugin; route MCP-driven workflows to the MCP plugin.

## Workflow Order

1. Resolve source and (if cross-workspace) target workspace.
2. Validate configuration where the command supports it (e.g. `sup sync validate`) before previewing.
3. Preview / diff to surface what will change.
4. Summarize asset counts, target effects, rollback expectations, and any destructive flags.
5. Ask for typed confirmation containing the literal destructive flag string.
6. Stop before execution and wait for the typed confirmation.
7. Execute only after confirmation.
