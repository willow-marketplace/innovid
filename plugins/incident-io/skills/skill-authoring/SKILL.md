# Skill authoring

A skill is instructions your agents follow: a SKILL.md with a triggering description,
plus references it loads on demand. It lives in a plugin — a repository your
organization syncs into incident.io and can also install into coding agents. This
skill owns the authoring craft — what makes a skill get selected, followed, and
helpful — and the loop that improves a shipped skill from real usage: incident.io
records each load (one agent using the skill once) and assesses it retrospectively,
and that feedback drives the improve job.

## The two jobs

- **Create** — author a new skill into the user's plugin: pin it down with concrete
  trigger examples, check nothing owns the job already, draft to the format, register
  it, ship it. → [references/create.md](references/create.md)
- **Improve** — edit an existing skill from evidence: read its usage feedback with
  improve.md's reading corrections applied, fix by theme without undoing credited
  strengths, verify the fix against the recorded issue where the session can, ship,
  confirm. → [references/improve.md](references/improve.md)

Both jobs load the same two files before drafting:
[references/format.md](references/format.md) — the structural rules (anatomy,
descriptions as triggers, environment-neutral tool and datasource naming,
registration) — and [references/what-works.md](references/what-works.md) — what the
best-performing skills share, from incident.io's own estate and the assessment of
real usage. Format answers "is this valid"; what-works answers "will this get
followed". [references/example.md](references/example.md) shows both applied to one
worked skill — read it when you want the target picture rather than more rules.

One further reference is conditional:
[references/triage-skills.md](references/triage-skills.md) — read it when the skill
should be reached for by incident.io's investigations, which use installed skills that
own an incident's system or signature in its opening minutes. Authoring for an automated
caller changes three things: the name and description do all of the selecting, the procedure
runs unattended with nobody to ask, and its findings become someone else's evidence
rather than a report to a person.

## Where the skills live

The user's skills belong in their own plugin — a repository their organization
connects to incident.io — never in this one. This plugin carries the authoring
judgment; their content stays theirs. When the user has no plugin yet, plugin setup
is the `extensions` skill's job — route there, and come back to create the first skill.

Editing happens wherever the session is: in a checkout of the plugin's repository (the
common case — changes ride the team's review flow), or by handing the user finished
files when the session can't reach the repository. Never write into a plugin the user
didn't point you at.

## What this skill is not for

Runbooks and architecture docs — those are content with their own formats, owned by
the `runbooks` and `architecture` skills in this plugin; a skill is instructions for an
agent, not knowledge for a person. And reviewing all your plugins at once ("are our
skills healthy?") is the `doctor` skill's job — this skill works one skill at a time,
from evidence about that skill.

## Ground rules
- **Speak the user's language, not this skill's.** The user hasn't read this file so
  say what you're doing plainly. Never cite a reference filename or similar detail 
  to them, and use human-friendly names and titles rather than IDs.
