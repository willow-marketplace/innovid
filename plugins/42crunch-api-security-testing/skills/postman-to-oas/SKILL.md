# Skill: Postman Collection to OpenAPI Specification

Convert a Postman collection into a complete, valid **OpenAPI 3.0** specification
file (`openapi.json`). No existing OAS file is required as input.

---

## Entry Point

Ask the user for the required inputs, then execute Steps 1–8.

**Call `AskUserQuestion`:**
- **question**:
  ```
  Please provide the following inputs:

  1. Postman collection file path (JSON, v2.0 or v2.1)

  2. Postman environment file path (optional, JSON — skip if none)

  3. Output file path for the generated OpenAPI spec (default: openapi.json in the collection's directory)
  ```
- **options**: `["Provide paths one by one", "Provide all paths at once", "Cancel"]`
  - If "Provide paths one by one": ask for each separately, allowing the environment file to be skipped
  - If "Provide all paths at once": ask for all paths in one input, comma-separated
  - If "Cancel": exit gracefully

After collecting inputs:
> "I'll read the Postman collection and generate a complete OAS 3.0 spec at `<output path>`. This may take a moment."

---

## Step 1 — Read and Parse the Postman Collection

Read the full contents of the Postman collection file. Confirm it is valid
Postman format by checking for `info.schema` containing `postman-collection`.

Identify the schema version:
- v2.1 schema URL contains `v2.1.0`
- v2.0 schema URL contains `v2.0.0`

Both versions are handled identically in subsequent steps.

Extract top-level metadata:
- `info.name` → candidate for `info.title` in the OAS
- `info.description` → candidate for `info.description` in the OAS
- `info.version` → candidate for `info.version` in the OAS (fall back to `"1.0.0"`)
- `variable[]` → collection-level variables (key/value pairs used as defaults)

If an environment file path was provided, read it and parse its `values` array
into a flat map: `{ key: value }`. These environment values take precedence
over collection-level variables when resolving `{{variableName}}` placeholders.

Environment values are also a preferred source of concrete examples in the
generated OAS when they map to request or response fields (for example:
`userId`, `picture_id`, `token`, `baseUrl`).

Build a merged variable map:
1. Start with collection `variable[]` entries
2. Overlay environment `values[]` entries (same key wins from environment)

Build an example-value map from the same merged variables and use it when
filling parameter and schema `example` fields.

---

## Step 2 — Flatten the Collection into a Request List

Postman collections nest requests inside `item` arrays. Folders are `item`
entries that themselves contain an `item` array (no `request` property).
Requests are leaf `item` entries with a `request` property.

**Recursively** walk the entire `item` tree:
- If an entry has `item` (array): it is a folder — recurse into it, tracking
  the folder name(s) as a breadcrumb for tag assignment
- If an entry has `request`: it is a leaf request — extract it

Track folder breadcrumbs: the top-level folder name becomes the OAS `tag`.

For each leaf request, extract:

### URL
- Raw URL: `item.request.url.raw` (or `item.request.url` if it is a string)
- Resolve all `{{variableName}}` placeholders using the merged variable map
- Path segments: `item.request.url.path[]` — join with `/`, prefix with `/`
- Host: `item.request.url.host[]` — join with `.` to form the hostname
- Protocol: `item.request.url.protocol` (default `https`)
- Port: `item.request.url.port` if present

### Method
`item.request.method` — normalize to uppercase: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`,
`PATCH`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`

### Path Variables
`item.request.url.variable[]` → `{ key, value }` — these are concrete values
for `{variableName}` placeholders in the path segments.

Identify parameterized path segments:
- A segment wrapped in `{{...}}` or `:name` or `{name}` style is a path parameter
- Cross-reference `url.variable` keys to determine the canonical OAS parameter name
- Convert all path parameter formats to OAS-style: `{paramName}`

### Query Parameters
`item.request.url.query[]` → `{ key, value, description, disabled }`
- Exclude entries where `disabled: true`
- Resolve `{{variableName}}` in values using the variable map

### Request Headers
`item.request.header[]` → `{ key, value, description, disabled }`
- Exclude entries where `disabled: true`
- Exclude `Content-Type` and `Accept` (these map to OAS `content` / `produces`)
- Resolve `{{variableName}}` in values
- Retain `Authorization` headers only to infer security schemes — do not emit
  them as explicit header parameters

### Request Body
`item.request.body`:
- `mode: raw` and `options.raw.language: json` → parse `raw` string as JSON;
  if parse fails, treat as a raw string schema
- `mode: raw` and language is `xml`, `text`, `html` → record content type as
  `text/xml` or `text/plain`; do not attempt to parse the body further
- `mode: formdata` → collect `{ key, value, type }` pairs (`type` is `text` or `file`)
- `mode: urlencoded` → collect `{ key, value }` pairs
- `mode: graphql` → record as `application/json` with a GraphQL body shape
- `mode: file` → record as `multipart/form-data` with a binary file field
- No body or `mode: none` → omit `requestBody` entirely

Skip bodies that contain obvious attack payloads:
- SQL keywords: `SELECT`, `UNION`, `DROP`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `--`
- NoSQL operators: `$ne`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$where`, `$regex`
- XML injection: `<!DOCTYPE`, `ENTITY`, `CDATA`
- Path traversal: `../`, `..\`
- Script tags or event handlers in JSON string values

Skip attack-oriented requests entirely (do not emit them into `paths`):
- Requests under folders named like `Attacks`, `Security Tests`, `Exploits`, `Abuse`, `Negative Tests`
- Request names/descriptions that indicate exploit scenarios, for example:
  `SQL Injection`, `NoSQL Injection`, `XSS`, `XXE`, `Path Traversal`,
  `Log4Shell`, `Password Leakage`, `Privilege Escalation`, `BOLA`, `BFLA`,
  `Un-authenticated Access`, `Invalid JSON`, `HTTP Verb Tampering`
- Requests whose normalized path itself is attack-like (for example containing
  traversal segments such as `../`)

When in doubt, prefer excluding security test/demo requests from the OAS
contract and note the exclusion in the conversion summary.

### Responses
`item.response[]` — each saved response in Postman:
- `status` → HTTP status code (integer)
- `name` → human-readable label for the response description
- `header[]` → response headers `{ key, value }`
- `body` → response body string; if parseable as JSON, parse it
- `_postman_previewlanguage` → `json`, `html`, `text`, `xml`

If a request has no saved responses, the operation gets no `responses` entries
other than a placeholder `default` (see Step 7.5 — Response rules).

---

## Step 3 — Infer Authentication Schemes

Walk every request's `Authorization` header and `auth` block:

### Per-request `auth` block (`item.request.auth`)
- `type: bearer` → Bearer JWT auth → `securityScheme` type `http`, scheme `bearer`, `bearerFormat: JWT`
- `type: basic` → Basic auth → `securityScheme` type `http`, scheme `basic`
- `type: apikey` → API key → check `in` field: `header`, `query`, or `cookie`
- `type: oauth2` → OAuth2; extract `authUrl`, `accessTokenUrl`, `scope` where available
- `type: noauth` → explicitly public — no security

### Collection-level `auth`
If the collection root has an `auth` block, it applies as the default to all
requests unless overridden per-request.

### `Authorization` header value patterns
- `Bearer {{token}}` or `Bearer <anything>` → bearer JWT
- `Basic {{credentials}}` or `Basic <base64>` → basic auth
- `ApiKey <value>` → API key in header

Deduplicate: if the same auth pattern appears across multiple requests, define
it once in `components.securitySchemes` with a canonical name:
- `BearerAuth`, `BasicAuth`, `ApiKeyAuth`, `ApiKeyQuery`, `OAuth2`

Track which requests use which scheme. A request with `type: noauth` gets
`"security": []` in its operation.

---

## Step 4 — Derive a Base URL and Servers Block

From the resolved URLs of all requests:
1. Collect all unique `protocol://host:port` combinations
2. If there is exactly one unique base URL, use it as `servers[0].url`
3. If there are multiple (e.g. `localhost` and a production domain):
   - List them all in `servers[]`
   - Add a `description` to each: `"Local development"`, `"Production"`, etc.
4. If the base URL contains `{{baseUrl}}` or similar variables, emit a
   server variable:
   ```json
   "servers": [{
     "url": "{baseUrl}",
     "variables": {
       "baseUrl": { "default": "<resolved value from environment>" }
     }
   }]
   ```
5. Fall back to `http://localhost` if no base URL can be determined

Strip the base URL from each request's path before building `paths` entries.

---

## Step 5 — Synthesize Schema from Request and Response Bodies

For each unique request body (grouped by path + method):

### JSON body → schema
Analyze the parsed JSON object and infer a JSON Schema:

- Top-level object → `type: object`
- Each key becomes a `properties` entry
- Infer `type` from the value:
  - JavaScript `string` → `type: string`; check for ISO date patterns → add `format: date-time`
  - JavaScript `number` with no decimal → `type: integer`
  - JavaScript `number` with decimal → `type: number`
  - JavaScript `boolean` → `type: boolean`
  - `null` → `nullable: true` on the property (OAS 3.0 style)
  - Array → `type: array`; infer `items` schema from the first element
  - Nested object → `type: object`; recurse
- Mark a property as `required` if its value is non-null and non-empty
  (heuristic: present and non-null in the example → likely required)
- Set `example` directly on each property schema using the Postman value
- When a property value is a resolved placeholder from the environment,
  preserve the resolved environment value as the `example`

### Form body → schema
- Each form field becomes a `properties` entry with `type: string`
- Fields with `type: file` get `type: string, format: binary`

### URL-encoded body → schema
- Same as form body but content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

### Response body → schema
Apply the same JSON-to-schema inference for response bodies.

### Schema deduplication
After inferring all schemas, look for structurally identical or near-identical
schemas across different operations:
- If two schemas share the same set of top-level property names and types,
  they are candidates to merge into a single `components/schemas` entry
- Name schemas after the resource inferred from the path:
  - `/users/{userId}` → `User`
  - `/vehicles/{vehicleId}` → `Vehicle`
  - `/auth/login` request body → `LoginRequest`; response → `LoginResponse`
- Use PascalCase for all schema names
- Use `$ref: "#/components/schemas/Foo"` wherever a schema is reused

---

## Step 6 — Build Path and Parameter Entries

For each unique combination of (normalized path, method) from the flattened
request list:

### Grouping
Multiple Postman requests with the same path and method (e.g. a success case
and an error case saved as separate requests) should be merged into one OAS
operation. Merge their saved responses and pick the most representative request
body example.

### Path Parameters
Every `{paramName}` segment in the normalized path must appear in `parameters`:

```json
{
  "name": "paramName",
  "in": "path",
  "required": true,
  "description": "<from Postman path variable description if present>",
  "schema": {
    "type": "string",
    "example": "<concrete value from Postman url.variable>"
  }
}
```

Infer `type` from the example value (numeric string that is always digits →
`type: integer`; UUID pattern → `type: string, format: uuid`).

Prefer environment-derived values for path parameter examples when available.

### Query Parameters

```json
{
  "name": "paramName",
  "in": "query",
  "required": false,
  "description": "<from Postman query param description if present>",
  "schema": {
    "type": "string",
    "example": "<value from Postman>"
  }
}
```

Mark `required: true` only if the parameter appears in every saved request
variant for this operation and has a non-empty value.

When query values come from `{{variableName}}`, use the resolved environment
value as the query parameter `example`.

### Header Parameters
Only emit non-auth, non-standard request headers as `in: header` parameters.
Omit: `Content-Type`, `Accept`, `Authorization`, `Host`, `User-Agent`,
`Content-Length`, `Connection`.

### Response Headers
For each saved response, extract non-standard response headers and add them
to the response `headers` map:

```json
"headers": {
  "X-Rate-Limit-Remaining": {
    "description": "",
    "schema": { "type": "integer" }
  }
}
```

Omit standard HTTP response headers: `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`,
`Transfer-Encoding`, `Connection`, `Date`, `Server`.

---

## Step 7 — Assemble the Full OAS Document

Build the complete OpenAPI 3.0 document:

### 7.1 — `openapi`
```json
"openapi": "3.0.3"
```

### 7.2 — `info`
```json
"info": {
  "title": "<collection name>",
  "description": "<collection description, or empty string>",
  "version": "<collection version or '1.0.0'>"
}
```

### 7.3 — `servers`
As derived in Step 4.

### 7.4 — `tags`
One tag per top-level Postman folder. If the collection has no folders,
derive tags from the first path segment of each route (e.g. `/users/*` → `Users`).

```json
"tags": [
  { "name": "Users", "description": "" },
  { "name": "Auth", "description": "" }
]
```

### 7.5 — `paths`
For each (normalized path, method) operation:

```json
"/path/{param}": {
  "get": {
    "operationId": "<camelCase unique id>",
    "summary": "<request name from Postman, cleaned up>",
    "description": "<request description from Postman if present>",
    "tags": ["<folder breadcrumb or inferred tag>"],
    "parameters": [...],
    "requestBody": {
      "required": true,
      "content": {
        "application/json": {
          "schema": { "$ref": "#/components/schemas/FooRequest" }
        }
      }
    },
    "responses": {
      "200": {
        "description": "<Postman response name or 'Success'>",
        "headers": { ... },
        "content": {
          "application/json": {
            "schema": { "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Foo" }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "security": [{ "BearerAuth": [] }]
  }
}
```

**`operationId` rules:**
- Globally unique across the entire spec
- Derive from the Postman request name: slugify to camelCase, remove special
  characters, prepend the HTTP method if ambiguous
  (e.g. "Get User By ID" → `getUserById`, "Create Vehicle" → `createVehicle`)
- Fall back to `<method><FirstPathSegmentPascalCase>` if name is generic

**Response rules:**
- Include every saved Postman response as a separate status code entry
- Only emit HTTP status codes that are explicitly saved in the Postman collection (`item.response[].code`)
- If a request has no saved responses at all, emit a single `default` entry:
  ```json
  "default": { "description": "Unexpected error" }
  ```
- A saved response with a parseable body gets `content`; one with an empty
  body omits `content` entirely (e.g. `204` or empty `text/plain` responses).

**Security rules:**
- If the collection has a global `auth` block, apply that scheme globally in
  the OAS root `security` field
- Override at the operation level:
  - `type: noauth` → `"security": []`
  - Different scheme → explicit per-operation `security`
- If auth is inconsistent across requests, omit the global `security` and
  apply per-operation only

### 7.6 — `components`

#### `components.schemas`
All inferred and deduplicated schemas from Step 5. Order alphabetically.

#### `components.securitySchemes`
All auth schemes from Step 3:

```json
"securitySchemes": {
  "BearerAuth": {
    "type": "http",
    "scheme": "bearer",
    "bearerFormat": "JWT"
  },
  "BasicAuth": {
    "type": "http",
    "scheme": "basic"
  },
  "ApiKeyHeader": {
    "type": "apiKey",
    "in": "header",
    "name": "X-API-Key"
  }
}
```

**Root key order:** `openapi`, `info`, `servers`, `tags`, `paths`, `components`

---

## Step 8 — Write the File and Self-Review

**Output location:**
- Use the path the user specified, or
- Default to `openapi.json` in the same directory as the Postman collection file

**Format:** JSON, 2-space indentation.

Before writing, run a self-review checklist:
- Every `$ref` target exists in `components`
- Every `{param}` in a path has a matching `in: path` parameter with `required: true`
- Every `operationId` is unique across the document
- Every response object has a `description` field
- No path string is missing a leading `/`
- Every `requestBody` is only on `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS` operations
  (never on `GET`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`)
- Every `in: path` parameter has `required: true`
- No duplicate paths (same path string + method combination)

Fix any violations found, then write the file.

---

## Step 9 — Report to the User

After writing the file, output a summary table:

```
Postman → OpenAPI Conversion Complete
  Output file:   <path to openapi.json>
  OAS version:   3.0.3
  Servers:       <N server URLs>
  Tags:          <list>
  Paths:         <N unique paths>
  Operations:    <N total operations>
  Schemas:       <N component schemas>
  Security:      <scheme names, or "None detected">

Requests processed:
  Total requests in collection:   <N>
  Operations generated:           <N>
  Requests merged (same path+method): <N>
  Requests skipped (attack payloads): <N>
  Requests skipped (attack/demo operations): <N>

Notes:
  - <any ambiguities, assumptions, or items that need manual review>
  - <any operations where response bodies could not be inferred>
  - <any path parameters that could not be confirmed — mark as TODO>
```

---

## Edge Cases and Special Handling

### `{{variableName}}` placeholders
- Resolve all `{{variableName}}` occurrences in URLs, headers, and body values
  using the merged variable map before any processing
- For resolved placeholders, propagate the resolved value into generated OAS
  `example` fields for path/query/header parameters and body schemas whenever
  the placeholder maps to that field
- If a variable cannot be resolved (not in collection or environment), leave
  the placeholder text as-is and note it in the summary
- `{{baseUrl}}` in the URL path → strip from the path; emit as a server variable
  or use the resolved value as the server URL

### Pre-request scripts and tests
- Ignore Postman pre-request scripts and test scripts entirely — they are not
  part of the API contract

### Security demo folders mixed with functional endpoints
- Some collections include dedicated attack/demo folders alongside valid API
  examples. Treat attack/demo requests as out-of-contract and exclude them from
  the generated OAS.
- Keep legitimate business operations even if they share the same endpoint as a
  skipped attack variant; merge only non-skipped request variants.

### Collection-level / folder-level variables
- Variables defined at the folder level apply only to requests in that folder
- Merge order: environment file > collection variables > folder variables > request variables

### Postman Auth inheritance
- If a folder has an `auth` block, requests in that folder inherit it unless
  they override with their own `auth` block
- Track this inheritance during the recursive traversal

### Duplicate request names
- If two requests produce the same `operationId` candidate, append a numeric
  suffix: `getUser`, `getUser2`, `getUser3`

### Requests with no URL
- Skip silently and note in the summary

### GraphQL requests
- Emit as a single `POST /graphql` operation with `application/json` request
  body containing `query` (string) and `variables` (object) properties
- If multiple GraphQL requests are present, still emit only one operation and
  note the limitation

### Multiple content types
- If the same operation appears with both JSON and form bodies across different
  saved requests, emit both content types under `requestBody.content`

### OAS 3.0 compliance constraints
- Use `nullable: true` for nullable fields (OAS 3.0 style, not `type: ["string", "null"]`)
- Use `$ref` everywhere a schema appears more than once
- Do not use `$schema`, `$id`, or other JSON Schema draft-07+ keywords
- Keep all schema types from the OAS 3.0 subset: `string`, `number`, `integer`,
  `boolean`, `array`, `object`
- Always include `operationId` — required for 42Crunch audit and scan tooling
- Use `format` where applicable: `date-time`, `date`, `uuid`, `email`, `uri`,
  `binary`, `byte`, `int32`, `int64`, `float`, `double`, `password`
