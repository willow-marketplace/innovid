# 42Crunch Setup

Prepares the environment for 42Crunch audit and scan workflows in two phases:
1. Ensure the `42c-ast` binary is installed at the canonical path.
2. Configure and store credentials.

---

## Entry Point

> **Caller context**: This skill may be invoked directly by the user or as a
> subroutine by another skill (e.g. `pre-flight`). Check whether a caller was
> passed. Steps 1 and 6 behave differently depending on this context — see each
> step for details.

### Step 1 — Introduce the setup

**If called directly by the user** (no caller context), greet the user and
explain what they'll be able to do once setup is complete:

> Welcome — let me get your 42Crunch environment ready. This is a one-time
> setup that takes about two minutes. Once done, you'll be able to:
>
> - **Audit** any OpenAPI file for security issues and get a scored, actionable report
> - **Scan** a live API to catch BOLA, BFLA, and conformance problems
> - **Fix** SQG-blocking issues automatically, with your approval at every step
>
> I'll handle this in two quick steps:
> 1. Install the `42c-ast` analysis binary on this machine.
> 2. Connect your 42Crunch credentials (Enterprise Platform account, or a token from Free Trial / Individual / Individual Pro / Team).
>
> Let's go.

**If called as a subroutine** (caller context is set), skip this greeting entirely and proceed directly to Step 2.

### Step 2 — Binary setup

Follow `../../references/binary-setup.md` completely (verbose mode — announce each major step to the user).

Stop and surface a clear error if the binary cannot be installed. Do not proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Credential setup

Follow `../../references/credential-setup.md` completely.

The procedure covers, in order:
- Silently check whether credentials are already present in
  `~/.42crunch/conf/env` (macOS/Linux) or `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env`
  (Windows). If already configured: show mode + masked key, offer to keep or replace.
- If not configured (or replacing): walk the user through the guided flow:
  - **Do you have a 42Crunch Subscription?**
    - No → show Free Trial registration link (`[42Crunch Free Trial](https://42crunch.com/freemium/?source=claude)`) and the paid-plans pricing breakdown (Individual / Individual Pro / Team / Enterprise); stop and wait for the user to return, then ask token-based vs Enterprise and route accordingly
    - Yes → **Is it a token or an Enterprise Platform account?**
      - Token → enter token
      - Enterprise → enter API Key → select Platform URL (US / EU / Other)
- Write credentials to `~/.42crunch/conf/env`, set `chmod 600` on macOS/Linux.

### Step 4 — Final verification

Run a quick end-to-end check:

```bash
# Binary (macOS / Linux)
"$HOME/.42crunch/bin/42c-ast" --version
```

```powershell
# Binary (Windows)
& "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\bin\42c-ast.exe" --version
```

```bash
# Credentials (macOS / Linux)
grep -E "^(API_KEY|TRIAL_TOKEN)=" "$HOME/.42crunch/conf/env"
```

```powershell
# Credentials (Windows)
Select-String -Path "$env:APPDATA\42Crunch\conf\env" -Pattern "^(API_KEY|TRIAL_TOKEN)="
```

If either check fails, report the specific failure and guide the user to resolve
it before continuing.

### Step 5 — Present summary

Display the setup summary (see Output Format below).

### Step 6 — Recommend next steps

**If called as a subroutine** (caller context is set), skip the next-steps
prompt entirely. Announce `"Setup complete — continuing."` and return control
to the caller. The caller (e.g. `pre-flight`) will resume from where it left
off.

**If called directly by the user** (no caller context), present the following:

> You're all set. Here's what you can do right now:
>
> - **`42crunch-audit`** — Hand me an OpenAPI file and I'll score it, classify
>   every security issue by severity, and fix the SQG-blocking ones with your
>   approval. A good first step if you haven't audited this API before.
>
> - **`42crunch-scan`** — Run a live conformance and authorization test against
>   a running API. I'll check for BOLA, BFLA, and response-contract violations.
>   Best run after the audit passes.
>
> - **`42crunch-api-security-testing`** — Runs both audit and scan back-to-back. The recommended
>   workflow when you want the full picture in one session.
>
> Which would you like to start with?

## General Constraints

- All detection steps (binary check, credential check) run silently. Surface
  output only on failure or when prompting the user.
- Never print the API key or token in plaintext after the user enters
  it. Always mask it (`api_••••••••` / `ide_••••••••` for platform tokens — keep
  prefix, replace rest; `<first-4-chars>••••••••` for tokens, e.g.
  `eyJh••••••••`).
- Use the `Bash` tool for all shell commands; use the `Edit` or `Write`
  tools when writing config files — never shell redirection.
- Use `curl` for downloads; fall back to `wget` if `curl` is unavailable. On
  Windows use `Invoke-WebRequest`.
- On Windows: binary filename is `42c-ast.exe`, paths use `\`, config lives in
  `%APPDATA%\42Crunch\conf\env`, skip `chmod 600` (Windows ACLs protect `APPDATA`).
