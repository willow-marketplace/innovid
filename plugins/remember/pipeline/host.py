"""Which agent CLI is hosting this plugin, and what it tells us (#407).

Remember was written against one host and reads that host's environment
directly. Four now exist, and they agree on far less than they appear to.
The table below covers the first three, which at least share field NAMES on
their hook stdin (`session_id`/`cwd`/`transcript_path`) even where the
VALUES differ; Antigravity (`agy`, #563, `ANTIGRAVITY` below) does not fit
this table at all -- its stdin payload uses entirely different field names
(`conversationId`/`workspacePaths`/`transcriptPath`), which is why its own
adapter scripts (`scripts/agy-*-hook.sh`) rename the payload before handing
it to the same hook scripts these three hosts already share, rather than
teaching this module a fourth column here:

    | | Claude Code | Codex | Gemini CLI |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | hook stdin `session_id`, `cwd`, `transcript_path` | yes | yes | yes |
    | tool event names | `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` | same | `BeforeTool`/`AfterTool` |
    | plugin-root env var | `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | `PLUGIN_ROOT` (+ `CLAUDE_*` alias) | none documented |
    | project-dir env var | `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (compat alias) | `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (compat alias, #456) |

The stdin payload is the only part all three arrived at independently. The
environment is the parochial part: Codex's `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is a
compatibility alias it chose to extend and can withdraw, and Gemini documents no
plugin-root variable at all -- but it does document a project-dir one. Gemini
CLI's own bundled docs (`@google/gemini-cli` 0.57.0,
`bundle/docs/hooks/index.md`, `### Environment variables`) list
`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` as `(Alias) Provided for compatibility`, alongside four
Gemini-native names (`GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR`, `GEMINI_PLANS_DIR`,
`GEMINI_SESSION_ID`, `GEMINI_CWD`) that carry no equivalent in this module,
since nothing here reads them yet. This corrects an earlier version of this
module, which claimed Gemini CLI "documents no environment variables for
command hooks at all" -- true of the plugin-root row, false of every other
row in the table above (#456). Settled from documentation, not from a live
`gemini` process: no `gemini` binary runs in CI
(`tests/test_gemini_project_dir_var_456.py` states the same limit
`tests/test_gemini_manifest_456.py` already states for the manifest), and the
much larger question -- whether this repo's several `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`-unset
shell branches (`scripts/resolve-paths.sh`, `scripts/lib-env-cache.sh`,
`scripts/user-prompt-hook.sh`, and others) still behave correctly now that
Gemini CLI is known to set it -- reaches well outside this module and is
tracked as its own follow-up rather than fixed here.

So this module is deliberately thin, and is not a host abstraction layer. It
holds the two things that genuinely differ — what a host calls its variables,
and how to recognise it — as *data*, so a fourth host is a table entry rather
than a search through the tree. Everything the hosts agree on stays where it is.

Three things are explicitly NOT here, because putting them here would be
inventing a seam rather than recording one:

- **Event names.** Bindings live in each host's own manifest, which is the file
  that has to name them anyway. A mapping table here would be read by nobody.
- **The summarizer.** ``pipeline/haiku.py`` shells ``claude -p`` or
  ``codex exec``, chosen by ``pipeline.haiku._choose_summarizer_provider()``
  -- "auto" reads the TRANSCRIPT the host wrote (``transcript_path()`` below
  plus ``pipeline.extract.sniff_file_envelope()``), not ``detect_host()``
  (#465; ``detect_host()`` was the original #460 mechanism, but the env-var
  signature it reads does not survive into the hook process that actually
  runs the summarizer). Two real providers now exist, which was this
  docstring's own bar for extracting an abstraction. A shared interface is
  still not here: each provider's auth model and output shape (Anthropic's
  ``--output-format json`` vs. Codex's ``-o <file>``) stay different enough
  that one would either leak one CLI's shape into the other or hide a
  distinction ``pipeline/haiku.py`` actually needs, so the provider dispatch
  lives beside the CLI calls it dispatches to, and only WHICH host is running
  lives here.
- **Path resolution in shell.** ``scripts/resolve-paths.sh`` runs before Python
  is worth starting and mirrors ``PLUGIN_ROOT_VARS`` by hand, the same way
  ``lib-slug.sh`` mirrors ``pipeline/slug.py``. ``test_host_shell_parity``
  fails if the two drift.

The payload fields themselves are read by the hook that owns stdin and passed on
through the environment (the channel #266 settled on); this module never reads
stdin, because it is imported by callers that have none and sourced into hooks
that have already consumed theirs.

# from today's registry-order answer; it would have been a label nothing
# reads, not a decision nothing else could reach.
#
# #465: that consumer no longer calls detect_host() at all -- the env-var
# signature this function reads does not survive into the process that
# actually runs the summarizer (see pipeline/haiku.py's own note on

    Validated here rather than at the call site because the value is copied
    from a payload written by the host: it is data, and the one thing worse
    than reconstructing a path is trusting an unusable one and reporting the
    resulting emptiness as a session with nothing in it.

    rather than assume this function will catch an untrusted value. It will
    not: it exists to validate a payload the caller already trusts, not to
    decide whether the caller should have trusted it.

    #431 is the decision for every OTHER caller -- ``scripts/save-session.sh``
    run by hand, ``scripts/doctor.sh``, a direct ``python3 -m pipeline.extract``
    -- none of which has a hook preamble to clear anything in. No containment

    value travel through, so a check added here binds both. The legitimate
    value -- what ``session-start-hook.sh``/``session-end-hook.sh`` export
    fresh, from their own validated stdin payload, on every run -- is the
    whole point of #407: trust wherever the host says the transcript lives,
    rather than reconstruct it, because reconstruction is what #263/#174/#157
    got wrong. A containment rule narrow enough to matter (under the project
    directory; under ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR``/``~/.claude``, which is itself a
    relocatable, user-set path and not "never" true of the project directory
    either -- see #166) would also reject a legitimate transcript the host
    handed over that happens to live somewhere else, on a different drive or
    mount, under a session-store layout this module has no business knowing
    (Codex and Gemini CLI are not documented here on purpose -- see the module
    docstring above). Splitting the two channels -- validate only the ambient
    one -- would need a second parameter threaded through every caller of
    ``transcript_path()``/``find_session()`` recording whether THIS call has a
    fresh stdin payload behind it, which is a real fix but a bigger one than
    this issue asked for, not attempted here. So the decision is the second
    option #424 offered: a caller with no preamble of its own inherits the
    ambient environment by design, the same way it already inherits ``$PATH``
    or ``$HOME``, and the hooks -- which run on every tool call whether or not
    a human is watching -- stay the hardened boundary. ``scripts/doctor.sh``
    says so loudly (a WARN naming the value) rather than silently trusting it,
