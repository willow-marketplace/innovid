"""Session JSONL parser — extract human/assistant exchanges from a host's transcript.

Reads a session JSONL file, filters out metadata and system messages, and
produces formatted text with role-labeled exchanges suitable for
summarization by Haiku. Three transcript envelopes are understood -- Claude
Code's, Codex's, and Antigravity's (`agy`, #563) -- via
``sniff_file_envelope()`` and the per-host adapters in ``pipeline/host.py``
(#443); an "unrecognised" shape is reported rather than silently read as an
empty session.

Supports incremental extraction (only new messages since last save) and
full extraction (all messages or last N).

Callable as module::

    python3 -m pipeline.extract --session <id>
    python3 -m pipeline.extract 10          # last 10 exchanges
    python3 -m pipeline.extract --all       # everything

Or imported::

      was never looked at -- a genuinely foreign run of bookkeeping-shaped
      lines long enough to hit the cap, or (in principle) a resolving line
      that exists past it. A file whose unplaceable count happens to land
      exactly on the cap and then ends is genuine exhaustion, not this --
      there is no unread line left for a later build to ever find.
    * Both ``False`` means the file was opened and read to genuine

    ``unreadable`` and ``capped`` are never both true: a file that could not
