"""Root-level pytest plugin: the #510 test-duration reporter.

`pytest` already prints `--durations` (wired via `addopts` in
`pyproject.toml`); nothing read it before this, so a single test dominating
a suite had no detector but a human scrolling a CI log by chance (#510's own
worked example: a test at 43.92s against ~6.5s for the next slowest, roughly
a fifth of the whole run, found only because a maintainer happened to read
that far).

`pytest_terminal_summary` fires at the end of every `pytest` invocation --
local or any leg of the CI matrix -- with no extra flag required, and reads
the same `TestReport` objects pytest's own summary is built from off
`terminalreporter.stats`, rather than re-parsing pytest's own formatted
`--durations` text. The actual duration math lives in
`scripts/report_test_durations.py`, kept separate so it can be unit-tested
without driving a nested pytest session.

This intentionally never raises and never touches `exitstatus`: a reporter
bug must not turn a green run red, and #510 is explicit that this is a
report a human reads, never a gate. That includes the import of
`scripts/report_test_durations.py` itself -- it happens inside
`pytest_terminal_summary`'s own `try`, not at module scope, so a defect in
that module degrades to the `could-not-measure` state instead of aborting
collection for the whole session (a module-scope import failure is a
`conftest.py` collection error, which pytest treats as fatal: zero tests
run, non-zero exit, no report at all -- exactly the total, silent failure
this feature exists to prevent, just promoted from "one test" to "every
test"). See `tests/test_conftest_import_failure_510.py` for the case this
guards against.
