"""#668: the flattened `_RCFG_*` config table `_config_load` (log.sh) builds
is cached across process invocations, keyed on the three config layers'
mtimes -- rather than forking `jq` (or Python, without jq) fresh on the
first `config()` call of every single hook process.

The cache is deliberately of the FLATTENED dump, not the raw merged
config.json: the raw merge can carry a live `haiku.oauth_token` and is
already a short-lived scratch file deleted at process exit
(lib-memory-dir.sh's own comment); a persistent cache of it would extend
that secret's on-disk lifetime. Both flatteners already drop the whole
"haiku" key before emitting a row, so the persisted cache never sees it.

#682: the cache used to live at `$REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/config.rcfg` -- inside
the PROJECT tree, a directory users commit and share -- and was loaded with
a bare `source`. A repository could ship that file and have every hook that
sources log.sh execute its contents as shell. The tests below cover both
halves of the fix: the cache moved to the system temp dir (never inside a
clonable project directory), keyed on `REMEMBER_DIR` so two projects never
share a file; and the loader validates every line's shape before assigning
any of it, rather than trusting `source` with an unread file.

# Coordinator follow-up review of the #682 fix above: `_remember_cfg_flatten_
# cache_valid_value`'s plain-form branch was an ASCII whitelist
# (`[A-Za-z0-9_./:@%+=~-]`) rather than a blacklist of what can actually
# change how `eval "NAME=value"` parses a single plain assignment. Two
# concrete costs of that over-narrow whitelist, both silent: any config
# value containing `#` (a real, unremarkable byte -- e.g. `#deadbeef` as a
# tag) or any non-ASCII byte (an accented or CJK path/value) was REJECTED
# by a validator whose whole job is to accept everything `%q` actually
# produces, and a rejection here is not just a missed hit -- the loader
# `rm -f`s the file and the publisher republishes it on every single run
# (mktemp + rm each time), forever, for that user. Separately: bash 3.2
# (macOS's stock /bin/bash) tilde-expands after an unquoted `:` in an
# assignment, not just at the start of the word, and 3.2's own `%q` does
# NOT escape a tilde in that position (`printf %q 'a:~'` -> `a:~`, whereas
# bash 5's does: `a:\~`) -- so a value shaped like `foo:~/bar` reaching the
# blanket `eval` on 3.2 alone would substitute a home directory instead of
# assigning the literal string.
