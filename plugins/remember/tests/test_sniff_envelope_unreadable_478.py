"""sniff_file_envelope() collapses two different facts into the same
"unrecognised" string (#478): an OSError reading the file (permission
error, bad mount, a file that vanished between listing and open) and an
exhausted, fully-parseable file that simply never named a known host shape.
The docstring already names the collapse honestly; the receipt
(scripts/save-session.sh:276) does not -- it points a user whose transcript
is simply unreadable at a shape-sniffing function, the wrong place to look.

This repository's scripts/ lane is held by another agent right now, so the
log-line half of the fix is out of scope here. What is fixed in pipeline/ is
the source of the distinction: sniff_file_envelope() keeps returning
"unrecognised" for both cases (so the shell bridge's existing
``[ "$ENVELOPE" = "unrecognised" ]`` check, which the #450 quarantine
depends on, is untouched), and a new status call carries the OSError case
out separately, the same "keep the old contract, add a new signal" shape
#458's fix took one function over.

Every "must not fire" case (a genuinely empty/unrecognised-but-readable
file) is paired with a "must fire" case (the same file, made unreadable).
