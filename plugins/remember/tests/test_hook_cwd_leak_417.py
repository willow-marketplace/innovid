"""Regression pin for #417: post-tool-hook.sh and user-prompt-hook.sh must not
silently inherit REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD from the process environment.

resolve-paths.sh falls back to REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD (#411) when CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
is unset. Only session-start-hook.sh and session-end-hook.sh ever set that
variable -- each from its own stdin `cwd`, freshly validated on every run.
post-tool-hook.sh and user-prompt-hook.sh source resolve-paths.sh (on their
slow path) without ever managing the variable themselves, so before this fix
they would silently consult whatever the process environment already held --
on a host that reuses one environment across separate hook invocations, that
could be a value a DIFFERENT session's SessionStart exported for a DIFFERENT
project.

Reachability of that host behaviour was never established (see the issue), so
the fix is not a reachability check -- it is an unconditional `unset
REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD` near the top of each hook, before either hook does
anything else. This is correct regardless of whether the leak is reachable on
any real host: neither hook has a stdin `cwd` of its own to offer, so the
variable is never theirs to use.

Two tests, one fixture family:

* test_resolve_paths_sh_still_honours_the_variable_when_asked -- the POSITIVE
  control. If resolve-paths.sh's own REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD arm were silently
  broken or dead code, the "must not fire" tests below would pass for the
  wrong reason (nothing propagates a leaked value because the underlying
  mechanism never worked in the first place, not because the hooks correctly
  clear it). This proves the mechanism this fix defends against is real.

* test_post_tool_hook_clears_the_variable_before_sourcing_anything and its
  user-prompt-hook.sh sibling -- the MUST NOT FIRE half: each hook's own
  preamble (from BASH_SOURCE resolution through the new `unset` line) is
  extracted verbatim and executed with REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD pre-set to a
  directory that is very much NOT this hook's own project. If the `unset`
  line were ever removed or reordered, the variable would still hold that
  directory afterwards and this test would fail.
