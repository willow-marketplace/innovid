"""Shared helper for locating a real POSIX bash to drive subprocess-based
hook tests across platforms (#432).

On macOS and Linux, ``bash`` on PATH already is a real bash. On Windows,
``bash`` on PATH commonly resolves to the WSL launcher, not Git Bash -- the
bash that actually ships alongside Git for Windows and that a Windows user
invoking git-based tooling (the #82 reporter's own setup) actually has.

``find_git_bash`` is lifted verbatim from tests/test_hooks_json.py, written
for #82. That module now imports it from here instead of defining its own
copy, so the two Windows-bash-detection tests in test_hook_cwd_leak_417.py
and test_transcript_path_leak_424.py stop being skipped for the whole
platform (#432) and instead run for real under Git Bash, exactly as
test_hooks_json.py's own Git-Bash tests already do.
