"""detect-tools.sh's FATAL must say what it saw, not only what it concluded (#650).

A Windows reporter logged 1,650 consecutive `post-tool-hook.sh` failures over a
month, every one of them:

    FATAL: No working Python found. Tried: python3, python, py -3, py.

while `python -V` and `py -3 -V` both worked in the Git Bash the hooks are
launched from, and a second, independently written probe in another plugin
failed identically in the same window. Then it self-resolved. Nobody can say
why, because the message names the candidates and nothing else: not the PATH
the probe searched, not which candidates `command -v` found, not what the ones
it found exited with. The reporter's own request was exactly that -- with those
in the log, "a report like this one would be answerable from the log alone
rather than needing a reconstruction after the fact".

So: the FATAL line stays (it is what people grep for), and it is followed by the
PATH that was searched and one line per candidate saying `not on PATH` or the
exit status of its `-V` probe. The fixture puts one candidate on PATH that
exits 49 -- the Microsoft Store stub's own status, the case the reporter hit for
`python3` -- and nothing else, so the per-candidate lines have something
specific to say. The positive control sources the same file with a working
interpreter on PATH and asserts it says nothing at all: a probe that narrates
on success would put four lines on every hook's stderr, which the hot path
redirects into hook-errors.log.
