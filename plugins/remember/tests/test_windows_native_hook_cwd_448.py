"""#448: resolve-paths.sh tested REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD for directory existence
BEFORE the Windows backslash/drive-letter normalization block that would have
made it resolvable, so a `cwd` arriving in Windows-native spelling was tested
in the form the shell cannot resolve and the branch was skipped before the
normalization that would have fixed it ever ran. On a host with no
CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (Codex, Gemini CLI) that meant every hook silently no-oped
via its own `|| exit 0`.

REASONED, not fully observed (the issue's own caveat): found by reading, in a
session with no Windows or Git Bash shell. This test is what would settle it
-- it needs the Windows CI leg to be meaningful, which is exactly why it uses
tests/_bash_runner.py's resolve_bash() (#432/#439) instead of a blanket
skipif(win32) -- a skip here would reproduce the #442 defect (a Windows-only
regression test skipped on the one platform that could catch it) in the very
lane meant to fix a Windows bug.

On Windows, pathlib.Path renders its own separators natively -- str(project)
for a Windows tmp_path already comes back with backslash separators, i.e.
genuine Windows-native spelling, with no synthetic construction needed. On
macOS/Linux this collapses to the ordinary POSIX-path case every other
REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD test already covers, so the four assertions below are not
redundant with the existing suite only on the Windows leg -- which is the
platform this issue is about.

That native-backslash spelling is deliberately used ONLY for the stdin
`cwd` payload field under test -- see `_win_bash_path` below for why every
OTHER path handed to bash (the script argv, HOME, CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT) is
forced to forward slashes instead. A first version of this file used
`str(...)` unnormalized for those too and broke session-start-hook.sh's own
self-location on the real windows-latest CI leg before ever reaching
resolve-paths.sh's candidate logic -- a harness bug, not a finding about
the fix, caught by CI and fixed here rather than papered over: this repo's
own tests/test_hooks_json.py already established forward-slash-always as
the convention for exactly this reason, and this file now follows it.

All four hooks that read the #411/#444 REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD fallback are covered:
session-start-hook.sh and session-end-hook.sh (#411), user-prompt-hook.sh and
post-tool-hook.sh (#444).

Positive control: test_windows_hook_cwd_alone_would_fail_before_the_448_fix
below runs a fabricated Windows-native path directly against a bare `[ -d ]`
test on the resolved bash, proving that form is one bash genuinely refuses to
resolve on this platform -- so the fixture is demonstrated capable of failing
and the green results above are not an artifact of a harness that never
really exercised the code path. Its sibling,
test_session_start_scaffolds_nothing_when_cwd_is_genuinely_unusable, is the
existing "must not fire" half moved into this module for the same reason
test_hook_cwd_end_to_end_411.py pairs its own positive case with one.

    itself arrives POSIX-style on Windows (this file's own header comment on
    CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR says the same). `pathlib.Path.__str__` on Windows
    renders native backslashes, which is the right spelling for an OS-level
