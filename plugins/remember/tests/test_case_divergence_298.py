"""The store is known by more than one spelling, and only case tells them apart (#298).

── What this is NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#298 was filed on a premise that did not survive measurement. It claimed a store
created under the pre-#263 drive-letter spelling (`C--Users-…`) is orphaned by the
post-#263 resolver (`c--Users-…`), stranding the memory written before the upgrade.

@jqit-ricky has the only Windows box any of this can be pointed at, and measured
it instead of arguing about it: `Test-Path` on both spellings returns `True` for
the **same directory object**, with 88 files reachable through either name. NTFS is
case-insensitive, so two stores differing only in case is not a state that
filesystem can be in. Nothing is stranded, the plugin reads that store, and the
orphaning cannot happen on the platform #263 came from.

So there is nothing here to migrate, nothing to merge, and nothing to rename. This
file tests **disclosure only**, and `test_nothing_here_repairs_anything` is the
guard that keeps it that way.

── What survived, and it is not what was filed ──────────────────────────────────

Git's index is case-sensitive where NTFS is not. On the reporter's machine:

    on disk : C--Users-ricky-dev-jqit-project-b
    in git  : c--Users-ricky-dev-jqit-project-b

That costs nothing while the store stays on NTFS. It stops being free on a
case-sensitive filesystem, and the git backup exists precisely so the store can be
restored somewhere else. Verified on a real case-sensitive APFS volume rather than
reasoned about: one repository carrying both spellings, one plain `git clone`, and

    out/C--proj/remember.md
    out/c--proj/remember.md

two directories, two `remember.md`, and a resolver that reads exactly one of them.

── What is checked, and what deliberately is not ────────────────────────────────

Two probes over one question — *is this store known by a second spelling that
differs only in case?* — asked of the two places that can answer:

* **disk** — the directory names in the store root that case-fold to the one we
  resolved. On a case-insensitive filesystem there is exactly one entry and the
  question is whether it is spelled the way we resolved it; that is the state the
  reporter measured, and it is the reason this is not implemented as "does a
  sibling store root exist". On NTFS there is never a sibling, so a sibling check
  would be dead code on the platform it was written for.

* **git** — the top-level names in `HEAD`'s tree of the store's own repository.
  `HEAD`'s tree and not the history: a clone checks out `HEAD`, so **history
  carrying both spellings is inert while `HEAD` carries one**. That distinction is
  load-bearing and is why this does not run `git log --all`.

Whether any real store's *history* holds both spellings is still unknown, and
nothing here assumes an answer.

── Three states, and the fourth that is not a state ─────────────────────────────

`ok` (compared, they agree) / `diverged` / `unavailable` (could not compare —
no git, not a repository, nothing committed). An absence produced by the check
must never read as agreement; that conflation is this repo's recurring defect and
the reason #296 and #299 look the way they do.

`not-applicable` is separate from all three and means the comparison does not
exist: the legacy layout, where `REMEMBER_DIR` is `<project>/.remember` inside the
user's own repository. That is not "we looked and found nothing", it is "there is
nothing here that could diverge".

── The tone the message has to hold ─────────────────────────────────────────────

On the reporter's machine this condition is TRUE and completely harmless today.
A reader must not be able to conclude the opposite of the truth from it: it is a
heads-up about a restore, not a report that memory is broken.

    For `post-tool-hook.sh` the property is now asserted directly rather than as
    byte-equality with `origin/main` (#322). Byte-equality says "nobody has
    edited this file since main", which is a different claim from "the hot path
    is still cheap" and fails in both directions: it stopped an unrelated
    one-token arithmetic guard in that file, and it goes vacuous the moment the
    edit it objected to lands on main. What #298/#299 actually care about is
    that the divergence check is unreachable from the per-tool-call path and
    that the path spawns no git, so that is what is checked here -- a
    substring check, and only that. #330 named vectors that reintroduce the
    same cost while staying green against it (a git call spelled through a
    variable or `command`, an extra file read or loop with no new spawn at
    all): see tests/test_hot_path_cost_pin_330.py for the measured spawn and
    read-builtin pins that close that gap. This test is not redundant with
    it -- a literal check is cheap and catches a copy-paste of the real
    divergence code even when it would never run -- but it is no longer the
    whole story on its own.

    The other two arms keep the byte compare, over CODE LINES only (#350). They
    were never about prose: they exist so that nothing reaches into these two
    hot-path libraries and adds a spawn, and a comment cannot add one. Comparing
    whole files made the guard fire on a paragraph — this time on a comment in
    `lib-memory-dir.sh` that had itself become false, saying `bootstrap-dirs.sh`
    is sourced on every tool call when #350 had just stopped that. A guard that
    forbids correcting a stale comment is a guard arguing for the stale comment,
    and prose that no longer matches the code is this repo's own defect class.
    Strip the comments from both sides — the same one-liner the arm above
    already uses — and every executable byte stays pinned exactly as before.

    One EXECUTABLE line in `lib-memory-dir.sh` is allowed to differ, via
    `_SANCTIONED_DIVERGENCE` below: #429 replaced a PID-suffixed literal tmp
    path with `mktemp`, closing a predictable-symlink TOCTOU whose write
    (traced and reproduced in `tests/test_predictable_tmp_429.py`) can carry
    a live `haiku.oauth_token` to an attacker-chosen path. That is a real,
    deliberate spawn added to Pass 2 of the config merge -- exactly the kind
    of change this guard exists to surface, not to forbid outright -- and it
    runs only on the resolving run (first tool call of a session, or after a
    config edit), never on the per-tool-call fast path this guard actually
    protects. The substitution is applied to the origin/main side before the
    compare, so it is scoped to this one sanctioned line: anything else that
    diverges from origin/main in either file still fails this test.
