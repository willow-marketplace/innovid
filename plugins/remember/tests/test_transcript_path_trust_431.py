"""#431 — save-session.sh, doctor.sh and a direct pipeline.extract call still
trust an ambient REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH; this pins the decision, not a bug.

#424 asked what containment means for a transcript path when the host will
not tell you where transcripts live. #430 hardened the two hooks that have no
transcript_path of their own to offer (post-tool-hook.sh, user-prompt-hook.sh)
by unsetting the variable outright. This closes the remainder of that row: a
*manual* invocation -- a user running save-session.sh or doctor.sh by hand, or
calling pipeline.extract directly -- has no hook preamble to clear anything in,
and the decision recorded in pipeline/host.py and README.md is that such a
caller trusts its own process environment by design, the same way it already
trusts $PATH or $HOME. The hooks remain the hardened boundary.

Two things are pinned:

1. save-session.sh's own file never grows a silent `unset
   REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH` -- that would flip the documented decision without
   telling anyone, exactly what the issue calls "the absence of a check that
   nobody decided" in the other direction.
2. `pipeline.extract.find_session()`, called directly (the manual-invocation
   shape), still honours a supplied path that lives nowhere near any project
   or session directory -- documenting that this is existence-only by design,
   not accidentally uncontained.
3. doctor.sh, run with the variable ambiently set, says so loudly (WARN) with
   the path in its report, rather than silently proceeding -- this is the one
   real behavioural fix in this issue, since doctor.sh currently says nothing.
