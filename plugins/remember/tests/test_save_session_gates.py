"""save-session.sh extraction gates: what skips, what saves, what advances (#147).

The saved position (``last-save.json``) is written only after a successful save,
while the cooldown marker is written before every gate. So any early exit that
leaves the position untouched makes the *next* run re-extract the identical span
and exit identically — once per cooldown window, forever. Two gates sit there:

* ``EXCHANGE_COUNT == 0`` — nothing to summarize, so the position must advance.
* ``HUMAN_COUNT < min_human_messages`` — real content, just not enough yet, so
  the position must NOT advance (those turns get summarized with the ones that
  follow). But an *agentic* session — many tool calls, few human turns — never
  clears this gate at all, so a large-enough span saves anyway.

These tests drive the real script with a stubbed ``pipeline.shell`` so the gates
are exercised without a Haiku call.
