"""NOW_DAY_FILE's read lacks the regular-file type check ndc_read_gen() and
ts_marker_read() were both given (#642).

scripts/save-session.sh reads $NOW_DAY_FILE via a bare
`cat "$NOW_DAY_FILE" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]'`, guarded by nothing --
not even the `-e`/`-L` existence test ndc_read_gen() had before #634. A FIFO
or character device placed at this path hangs the whole script indefinitely
(cat on a FIFO with no writer blocks forever; a character device streams
unboundedly), the same defect #634 fixed for NDC_GEN_FILE and #625 fixed for
ts_marker_read()'s marker files.

Extracts the exact NDC_DAY read + case-fallback block out of
scripts/save-session.sh by content (not by line number, which the issue
itself flags as stale/pre-diff), mirroring the extraction technique
tests/test_ndc_read_gen_fifo_634.py already uses.
