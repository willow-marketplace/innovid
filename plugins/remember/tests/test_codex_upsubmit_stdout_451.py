"""Codex reads UserPromptSubmit as Failed once the hook actually prints (#451).

## The mechanism

Codex's own hook engine sniffs the first non-whitespace byte of a
`UserPromptSubmit` handler's stdout: `{` or `[` means "this is my JSON
contract" (`codex-rs/hooks/src/engine/output_parser.rs::looks_like_json`,
read from `openai/codex` @ 2026-08-29 -- Codex ships no separate hooks.md
naming this). That contract is
`codex-rs/hooks/schema/generated/user-prompt-submit.command.output.schema.json`,
consumed by `codex-rs/hooks/src/events/user_prompt_submit.rs::parse_completed`.
A byte that opens with `{`/`[` but fails to parse against that schema marks
the whole hook run `HookRunStatus::Failed` -- not because the hook errored
(exit code and stderr are irrelevant on this path), but because Codex tried
to read plain text as its own wire format.

`scripts/user-prompt-hook.sh` has always printed `[HH:MM TZ -- user]` on
stdout -- a prompt stamp that opens with `[`. Before #444, path resolution
hit a FATAL on a host that never sets `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and the hook
printed nothing at all, which is why this collision was invisible until
#444 made the hook succeed on Codex for the first time.

## The oracle

`_codex_upsubmit_status` below is a line-for-line port of that Rust
exit-0 branch, restricted to the two shapes this file ever hands it (a
plain string, and the JSON envelope the fix emits) -- it is not a general
JSON-Schema validator and is not fed attacker-controlled input.
`test_oracle_matches_codexs_own_fixtures` pins it against literal stdout
strings lifted from `codex-rs/hooks/src/engine/output_parser.rs`'s own
`structured_output_rejects_invalid_shapes_and_types` test, so a change to
this file's oracle that drifts from Codex's real parser fails on its own,
independent of anything `scripts/user-prompt-hook.sh` does.

## What is NOT covered here

Whether `scripts/session-start-hook.sh` has the same defect was the open
question in #451's brief. It does not: every stdout write in that script is
either a `=== ... ===` header or a line beginning with a letter (see
`test_session_start_first_byte_is_never_bracket_or_brace` below, which
drives the real hook end-to-end against a full store, a repeated-handoff
delivery, and an empty store -- the three shapes that produce this file's
own bracket-opening line, `"[already delivered ..."`, and it is always
preceded on the same run by an unconditional `echo "=== LAST HANDOFF ==="`
one line earlier). OBSERVED against those three shapes, not proven for
every reachable branch of a 1400-line script.
