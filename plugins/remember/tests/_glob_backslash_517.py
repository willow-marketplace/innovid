"""Shared harness for #517's extracted-block tests.

Each of the 7 sites #517 fixes is a bash glob or parameter-expansion
pattern match that silently misses when its operand is backslash-separated
(the real shape REMEMBER_DIR/PROJECT_DIR arrive in on msys/cygwin, per
resolve-paths.sh's own _remember_normalize_win_path). Driving each site
through its full owning script end to end -- the way most of this repo's
hook tests do -- cannot reproduce that shape on a POSIX CI runner: the
normalizer that puts backslashes into PROJECT_DIR only fires for a
drive-letter-shaped input (`/c/...`, `C:/...`), and a macOS/Linux tmp_path
never looks like that, so forcing $OSTYPE=msys around a real subprocess
run leaves REMEMBER_DIR exactly as forward-slash as it always was there.

tests/test_autonomous_log_retention_487.py's own
_TestAutonomousLogHousekeepingGlobBackslash class solved the identical
problem for #487 by extracting the real fix's own code, verbatim, out of
its owning script and running it standalone in a bash subprocess with
REMEMBER_DIR handed a SYNTHETIC backslash-laden string directly -- no
resolve-paths.sh derivation chain involved, so no drive-letter-shaped
input is needed to reach it. This module generalizes that technique so
each of #517's other 6 sites (plus the shared _remember_forward_slash
helper itself) can reuse one extraction/run mechanism instead of 7 copies
of it.

`local OSTYPE=...` inside a wrapping function, NOT an environment variable
override -- #487's own test docstring for `_run_extracted_block` found
this is the one part of the technique that is NOT optional: a real
windows-latest runner's Git Bash resets $OSTYPE to its own compiled
default regardless of what the parent process's environment carries, so
`env["OSTYPE"] = ...` silently has no effect there, while a `local`
shadow inside a function is unaffected (confirmed on PR #499's own CI,
jobs 100892436094 and 100895310415).

    siblings, all 4 windows-latest legs): every one of this file's own
    call sites builds a several-hundred-byte, multi-line, heavily-quoted
    script string and hands it to Python's `subprocess.run` as a single
    argv element. On POSIX that element reaches bash byte-for-byte over
    `exec`; on Windows there is no argv array at the OS level at all --
    Python's own `subprocess` module re-serialises the whole list into ONE
    command-line string via `list2cmdline` (Microsoft C-runtime quoting
    rules), and `bash.exe` (an MSYS2/Cygwin binary, not an ordinary
    Windows executable) re-derives its OWN argv from that string using
    the Cygwin runtime's separate, POSIX-flavoured re-parser -- two
    different quoting conventions on either side of one string, and
    nothing here pins which one governs a script this long and this
    quote-dense. A short file PATH crosses that same boundary as a single
    plain token with no quoting ambiguity at all, which is exactly the
    property this rewrite trades for: the script's own bytes are written
    to disk directly (`newline="\\n"`, so Python's own text-mode layer
    cannot reintroduce a platform line ending either), and only the path
    -- never the script text -- is marshalled through argv.
