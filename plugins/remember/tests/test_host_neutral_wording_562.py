"""#562 -- README prose said "Claude Code" in sentences that are true of any
coding agent this project supports (Claude Code, Codex), and #562 also asked
to fold "Claude Remember" to "Remember" after a page's first mention, where
a page had drifted from that convention. Two wording rules, both host-neutral
prose only -- no manifest, no install command, no path, no hook-event name is
touched.

Would this test pass if nothing changed? Almost every assertion below names
an exact rewritten sentence that does not exist in the pre-#562 tree
(confirmed against the base commit's README.md and four docs/ pages via
`git show`), and separately asserts the narrow, Claude-Code-specific
sentences the issue says must survive untouched still do. The one exception
is test_readme_full_name_appears_once_then_short_name: on inspection every
page already held "Claude Remember" at most once, so there was no page left
to fold -- that function pins the already-correct convention as a regression
guard rather than a red-before-green check, and its docstring says so rather
than overclaiming, a distinction a reviewer had to point out because an
earlier version of this docstring claimed every assertion here was
red-before-green when this one was not (caught in self-review before #562's
commit)."""
