"""Tests for #487: logs/autonomous/session-end-*.log is never reclaimed.

#483 seeded `$_END_LOG` with a header line before the flush subshell ever
opens it, so save-session.sh's own housekeeping

    find "${REMEMBER_DIR}/logs/autonomous" -name "*.log" -empty -delete

no longer matches the log its own parent shell is writing into -- the
correct fix for the bug #483 was filed about. But that `-empty -delete` was
this directory's ONLY retention mechanism: there is no mtime sweep, no
count cap, no rotation. Before #483's fix, every ordinary session-end-*.log
was reclaimed on the next flush because it stayed empty; after it, every
one of them is non-empty by construction and nothing ever removed it. One
file per session, forever.

The fix adds a second, age-keyed sweep over the same "*.log" glob (so it
covers save-*.log and session-end-*.log alike -- both file classes this
directory ever holds), independent of emptiness. Emptiness was always a
proxy for staleness, and it is the proxy that produced #483 in the first
place.

Positive control lives in the same fixture, per this repo's own testing
rule: a run's OWN freshly-written log (mtime "now") must survive its own
housekeeping, exactly as test_session_end_log_swept_483.py already pins for
the emptiness sweep -- an assertion that only checked "the old file is
gone" would also pass if the housekeeping deleted the whole directory.

    """CI (PR #499, windows-latest 3.9/3.10/3.11/3.12 -- job 100831279309 and
    its three siblings): every one of those legs left BOTH the backdated
    file and this run's own fresh log in place, for every one of the three
    tests above -- default retention, configured retention, NDC disabled.
    No deletion at any age. That is the exact shape of a housekeeping loop
    whose glob matches nothing at all, for any file, every time.

    Root cause: resolve-paths.sh's `_remember_normalize_win_path` rewrites
    CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to a fully backslash-separated Windows-native form on
    msys/cygwin (Claude Code hands it over as `/c/Users/...`; #263/#448
    convert that to `C:\\Users\\...` so the three shell slug sites and
    Python's `_session_dir` agree with Claude Code's own slugging), and
    REMEMBER_DIR is lib-memory-dir.sh's legacy `"${proj}/${data_dir}"` --
    backslash-separated end to end on that platform, same as PROJECT_DIR.

    Every ordinary file op downstream (mkdir -p, >>, stat, rm -f) still
    works with that string on Windows, because the MSYS runtime that
    implements those syscalls translates it -- which is exactly why the
    earlier mkdir, the header write and the mtime read in this same flush
    all succeed on that leg (job log shows both files present, exit 0).
    bash's own glob does not get that translation: it recognises only '/'
    as a path-component boundary on every platform, including Windows Git
    Bash, because that is POSIX glob(3)'s own definition of a pathname, not
    a filesystem property -- a directory ARGUMENT to a glob with no real
    '/' anywhere in it can never match a real subtree, on any bash,
    anywhere. That divergence -- syscalls translate backslash, bash's own
    glob does not -- is the actual mechanism, and it is exactly as true on
    this machine's bash as it is on Windows Git Bash's.

    A full end-to-end run of save-session.sh with a genuinely
    Windows-native REMEMBER_DIR cannot be built on POSIX: POSIX mkdir/open
    treat a backslash as an ordinary filename character rather than a
    separator, so a literal backslash-named directory WOULD satisfy a
    literal-string glob component on POSIX, the two platforms would stop
    disagreeing by accident, and this bug would not reproduce. Extracting
    the real housekeeping block verbatim from the script under test (never
    retyped -- a hand-copied duplicate asserts what the copy happens to do,
    not what the file ships) and feeding it a SYNTHETIC backslash-laden
    REMEMBER_DIR string sidesteps that: only the directory argument to the
    glob is backslash-laden, so the fix's own normalization is exercised
    for real, while the glob's own expansion, and everything after it in
    the loop, land back on the real, forward-slash files this fixture
    created -- no windows-only filesystem behaviour needed to prove it.

        """Runs the REAL housekeeping block (extracted verbatim above) in a
        standalone bash process, stood up with just enough of its own
        dependencies (`config`, `log`) stubbed to let it execute in
        isolation from the rest of save-session.sh.

        `remember_dir` is embedded via `shlex.quote`, NOT an f-string
        `!r}` -- `repr()` of a string containing backslashes ESCAPES each
        one (Python-literal syntax: one input backslash becomes two
        characters, `\\\\`), and bash's own single-quoted strings do no
        backslash processing at all, so those doubled characters would
        survive into REMEMBER_DIR's runtime value verbatim -- a
        double-backslash-separated path, not the genuine single-backslash
        Windows-native shape #448 actually produces (self-review finding).
        `shlex.quote` wraps the value in single quotes without escaping
        backslashes, since backslash is not special inside them either --
        exactly what bash itself does with the string, byte for byte.

        `ostype`, empty by default, shadows $OSTYPE for the block via a
        `local` inside a wrapping function -- NOT an environment variable
        override (self-review-round-2 finding, CI round 5, job
        100892436094): a real windows-latest runner's own Git Bash resets
        $OSTYPE to its own compiled default ("cygwin" there) regardless of
        what the parent process's environment carries, so
        `env["OSTYPE"] = ostype` silently has no effect at all on that one
        platform -- the negative control that relied on it (forcing
        "linux-gnu") passed everywhere else and failed specifically there,
        for a reason that had nothing to do with the fix's own gate.
        `local OSTYPE=...` inside a function is a shell-scoping
        mechanism, not an inherited-environment one: it is not subject to
        whatever makes Git Bash re-assert its own OSTYPE from the
        environment, and `readonly -p` confirms OSTYPE is not a readonly
        bash special (a real one, like BASH_VERSION, could not be
        shadowed this way either). The fix in scripts/save-session.sh is
        itself gated on `case "$OSTYPE" in msys|cygwin)`, matching
        `_remember_normalize_win_path`'s own gate in resolve-paths.sh (the
        thing that puts backslashes into REMEMBER_DIR in the first place)
        -- so a backslash-laden REMEMBER_DIR only gets normalized when
