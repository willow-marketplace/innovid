"""Cross-plugin promo via `systemMessage` at `SessionStart` only (#574).

Three maintainer decisions settle the design (issue #574 comments), each
pinned by a test here:

1. `promos.json` (beside `config.example.json`) is data, not shell. An entry
   with no `url` is skipped, and the skip is VISIBLE (logged), never a
   silent link-less render.
2. The promo speaks only from `SessionStart`. This suite asserts the
   emission shape on that hook; `session-end-hook.sh` is asserted, by grep,
   to never mention `systemMessage` or `promo` at all -- the maintainer's
   "never on SessionEnd" is a property of the file, not just of this test's
   fixtures.
3. Only a plugin that is NOT installed is promoted. `installed_plugins.json`
   (version 2, `<name>@<marketplace>`) is the source of truth, and an
   unreadable/absent/wrong-version file must suppress the promo exactly like
   a confirmed install does -- "cannot-tell" and "installed" are the same
   output, and only a confident "not-installed" may speak. Each half of that
   claim needs its own fixture (a positive control), never one test alone.

Off switch (`features.plugin_promos`, default true) and throttle
(`cooldowns.promo_seconds`, once per N days, persisted as a machine-global
marker under `$HOME/.remember/tmp/`, independent of any per-project
`data_dir`) are asserted directly against the same session-start-hook.sh
subprocess harness `tests/test_session_start_compact_recap_339.py` already
established.
