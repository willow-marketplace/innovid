"""SessionEnd must leave a trace, and must keep the budget it was given (#647).

The reporter's Windows sessions fail on every exit with

    SessionEnd hook [bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/session-end-hook.sh"] failed: Hook cancelled

and `.remember/logs/autonomous/` holds not a single `session-end-*.log` across the
whole project history. `/remember:doctor` then reports "SessionEnd has never fired
for this project" and attributes it to hook registration -- sending the user to
debug a registration that is fine.

**The `Hook cancelled` itself is #560, already diagnosed and already fixed.**
Claude Code gives SessionEnd a 1.5-second budget shared across every hook on the
event, and this hook's synchronous preamble (`lib-clock.sh`, `resolve-paths.sh`,
`detect-tools.sh`, `bootstrap-dirs.sh`, `log.sh`) was measured at ~3.4s on a slow
Windows/Git-Bash machine. #560's fix declares `"timeout": 10` to raise that
ceiling, and `docs/hooks.md` carries the rest, including the
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS` fallback for the plugin-install case
where Claude Code's own carve-out means a declared timeout does not raise it. On
the plugin install route both reporters are on, that carve-out may make #561's
declaration do nothing. The fix that does not depend on it -- the hook process
detaching BEFORE its preamble, so nothing it does runs on Claude Code's clock --
is tested in tests/test_session_end_detach_before_preamble_647.py. What is here
is the two things around it.

**1. That `timeout: 10` reads exactly like an arbitrary leftover.** It is the only
timed hook in `hooks.json` -- `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit` and `PostToolUse`
all run untimed -- and #647's first suggestion is to drop or raise it on that
reading. Dropping it puts the ceiling back to 1.5s and fails silently: no error,
just sessions quietly losing their tails on slower machines. The test below pins
it so the next reader who finds it odd finds the reason with it. (An earlier
version of this very file asserted the opposite, on exactly that misreading,
before `docs/hooks.md` was checked.)

**2. A hook that exits early leaves no trace at all.** The `logs/autonomous/` seed
write sat at the very bottom of the script, after `resolve-paths.sh`,
`detect-tools.sh`, `bootstrap-dirs.sh`, `log.sh`, the `$REMEMBER_DIR` check and
the `$SAVE_SCRIPT` existence check. Every one of those early exits left the store
in precisely the state an unregistered hook leaves it in, which is the only state
doctor can read. A missing `save-session.sh` -- a half-finished install, the case
the hook's own `report_error` text says "Reinstall the plugin" for -- was
indistinguishable, to doctor, from a SessionEnd that never fired.

The fixture drives that through the missing-`save-session.sh` path because it is
deterministic and needs no timing: the trace has to be on disk by the time the
hook returns, whatever it decided to do afterwards. The paired positive control
runs the same fixture with the script present, so "a file exists" is not passing
against a harness that writes it unconditionally.

**Scope.** Moving the seed up cannot, on its own, rescue a hook cancelled during
the preamble -- the seed needs `$REMEMBER_DIR`, and resolving it is part of what
spent the budget. That is why the detach (the sibling test module) sits ahead of
the preamble: the seed then runs in a child on no budget at all. Together they
mean every exit after resolution leaves evidence, on every machine, so "fired and
gave up" stops looking like "never fired".

def test_session_end_keeps_its_declared_timeout():
    """SessionEnd's `timeout` must stay, and must stay 10s.

    It reads like an arbitrary leftover -- the only timed hook in the file,
    while `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit` and `PostToolUse` all run untimed
    -- and #647 proposes dropping or raising it on exactly that reading. It is
    the opposite. #560 ADDED it: Claude Code gives SessionEnd a **1.5-second
    budget shared across every hook registered for the event**, and a `timeout`
    declared on the hook is what raises that ceiling. The untimed siblings are
    untimed because their events carry no such shared budget to raise.

    So removing it is a regression, and a silent one -- nothing fails, sessions
    just start losing their tails on slower machines. That is what this test is
    for. The value is pinned to 10s because `docs/hooks.md` tells a user whose
    logs are still missing to set
    `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS=10000` "matching the `timeout` this
    hook declares"; if one moves, the doc is wrong about the other.

    What this does NOT assert is that the declaration is sufficient. Claude
    Code's own reference says "Timeouts set on plugin-provided hooks don't raise
    the budget", and `hooks/hooks.json` is exactly that location -- so on a
    plugin install the ceiling can stay 1.5s no matter what this file says. That
    gap is why the hook now detaches before its preamble (see the sibling
    module) instead of relying on this number at all; the pin stays so that
    the belt is not quietly removed on the grounds that there is a buckle.
