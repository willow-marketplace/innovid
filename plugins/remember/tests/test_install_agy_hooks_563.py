"""scripts/install_agy_hooks.py -- merges Remember's Antigravity hooks into
the shared ~/.gemini/config/hooks.json (#563).

Antigravity has no per-plugin manifest and no working variable substitution
in a shared hooks.json (no host-set plugin-root or project-dir variable --
pipeline/host.py's ANTIGRAVITY host declares neither, #563): every command
in the manifest has to be a literal, resolved absolute path, embedded at
install time. And the target file is SHARED across every plugin on the
machine -- unlike Claude Code's or Codex's own per-plugin hooks.json, an agy
install must not clobber another tool's own top-level hook name. Both of
those are what this installer -- and this test file -- exist to get right;
no live `agy` binary is needed to test either.
