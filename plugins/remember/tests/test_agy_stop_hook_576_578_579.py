"""agy-stop-hook.sh: three hardening findings on the same four lines
(#576, #578, #579).

#576 -- _CONVERSATION_ID reaches save-session.sh as argv[1] with no shape
requirement, and save-session.sh's own arg loop treats a literal "--force"
or "--dry" as a FLAG regardless of where it came from, not as an invalid
session id (which is only checked later, and only for the value that
actually lands in the positional slot). A conversationId of "--force" would
silently flip FORCE=true, bypassing the cooldown/min-message gates.

#578 -- the four-field newline-delimited stdout protocol between the python
extractor and the shell (`sed -n Np`) has no escaping: an embedded newline
in one field shifts every field after it by one line.

#579 -- (Windows/Git-Bash, reasoned not observed) python3 -c 'print(...)'
writes CRLF there; command substitution only strips a *trailing* newline
from the whole captured stream, so every field but the last would carry a
trailing \r no caller expects.

    reimplement the fix's own `${VAR%$'\\r'}` line by hand rather than
    exercising it, so neither would fail if that line were deleted from
    agy-stop-hook.sh itself, and the whole module skips on win32 anyway (the
    same reason every bash-hook test in this repo does), so #579 as fixed had
    no path from ANY CI leg to the actual code it changed.

    This closes that gap the way tests/test_config_dir_normalisation.py
    already does for a different Windows-only branch (see its own module
    docstring): stub the platform-specific tool -- here, a `python3` that
    translates the real interpreter's LF line endings to CRLF -- and run the
    REAL script against it on POSIX CI. The branch under test is
    Windows-only; the logic is not.

    Without the fix (the four `${VAR%$'\\r'}` lines in agy-stop-hook.sh), this
    fake python3 would leave a trailing CR on _CONVERSATION_ID, which the
    #576 charset guard then rejects outright (CR is not in
    [A-Za-z0-9._-]) -- so a regression here does not merely leave a stray
    CR in the ARGV recorded below, it makes the hook silently stop calling
    save-session.sh at all, and the marker file this test waits for would
    never appear.

    read_text(newline="") is NOT a stylistic choice: plain read_text() applies
    Python's universal-newline translation, which silently rewrites CRLF to
    LF on the way in -- the very CR this test exists to catch would then be
    invisible to the assertion below. Confirmed live: this test passed
    against the UNFIXED hook (git show HEAD~1:scripts/agy-stop-hook.sh) with
    a plain read_text() call, even though `od -c` on the same marker file
    showed a real 0x0D byte right after the conversation id -- until the read
