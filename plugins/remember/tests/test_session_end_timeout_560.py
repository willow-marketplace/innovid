"""SessionEnd hook must declare a per-hook `timeout` in hooks/hooks.json (#560).

Claude Code's SessionEnd budget defaults to 1.5 seconds, shared across every
hook registered for that event (Claude Code hooks reference, "Timeouts",
checked 2026-09). session-end-hook.sh forks its real flush into the
background and returns immediately once it has forked -- but the synchronous
preamble before that fork (lib-clock.sh, resolve-paths.sh, detect-tools.sh's
python/jq detection, bootstrap-dirs.sh, log.sh) was measured at ~3.4s on a
reporter's Windows/Git-Bash machine (#560), well past the 1.5s budget, so
Claude Code cancelled the hook before it ever reached the fork. Declaring a
`timeout` on the hook *asks* Claude Code to raise that shared budget to match.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT the fix does not fully resolve (documented in the pull
request and the docs update, not re-litigated in this test): the same
reference states "Timeouts set on plugin-provided hooks don't raise the
budget" -- and this hook ships as `hooks/hooks.json` inside a plugin, exactly
the location that clause names. Declaring `timeout` here is still correct
practice (it is honored by settings-file-registered copies of this hook, and
does no harm here even where the plugin-budget carve-out applies), but it is
not, by itself, a load-bearing fix for a plugin install -- see the docs
update and the changelog fragment for the actionable remedy
(CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS). This test only pins the one thing
this diff can enforce mechanically: the manifest declares a timeout.

Since #647 the preamble described above no longer runs in the process Claude
Code is timing: the hook reads stdin, re-launches itself detached, and exits, so
the budget is not load-bearing on any install route. The declaration stays --
harmless belt over a buckle -- and so does this test, so it is not removed on
the grounds that it "looks arbitrary" (tests/test_session_end_trace_and_budget_647.py
pins the same thing with that reader in mind). The measurement that proves the
detach is tests/test_session_end_detach_before_preamble_647.py.

The bar: would this test still pass if hooks.json were left unchanged? No --
today's manifest has no `timeout` key anywhere, so this fails for the right
reason (KeyError / missing field) before the fix, and passes once
`"timeout": 10` is added to the SessionEnd entry.
