"""The NDC partial-truncate commit must run under the save lock (#223).

#142 replaced NDC's blind `: > now.md` with a partial truncate: keep everything
past the byte offset the file had when the compression started. That closed the
180-second window in which a newer save's entry could be erased.

It did not close the one @Jutiphan named as defect (b) in #173. The commit —
`tail -c +N` into a temp file, then `mv` it over now.md — runs inside the
subshell backgrounded at the end of `save-session.sh`, and by then the parent
has released the save lock and exited. So:

1. `tail -c +N` reads to EOF into the temp file.
2. Another save acquires the lock and appends to now.md. It is entitled to —
   nothing is held here.
3. `mv` replaces now.md with a copy that predates step 2.

The step-2 entry is gone, its position already advanced, and nothing is logged:
the #142 signature again, in a window of milliseconds instead of minutes,
against the permanent memory record.

The fix re-acquires the lock in the subshell around the whole commit, and
re-reads the file's size under it before trusting the pre-Haiku offset. Losing
the re-acquire leaves now.md untouched, which lands in the same safe state as
the tail-failure branch: a possibly duplicated summary in today-*.md, no data
loss.

#173's own fix used `flock`, which does not exist on macOS; the `mkdir`-based
primitive in lib-lock.sh (#182) is what makes this portable.
