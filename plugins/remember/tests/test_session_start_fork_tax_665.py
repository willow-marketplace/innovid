"""#665 (part of #660): a `$( )` command substitution around a builtin still
forks a subshell to capture the output, even though nothing inside it execs
an external process. `tests/spawn_counting.py` counts execs, not forks -- a
`$(printf ...)` or `$(config ...)` on the flattened-cache-hit path shows up
there as zero spawns even though bash still pays a fork for the substitution
itself. This file counts THAT fork directly, with `bash -x` and a `PS4` that
carries `$BASHPID`: every real fork() gets bash a brand-new pid, so the
number of DISTINCT pids seen in a trace (other than the "home" pid the probe
started at) is the number of forks, regardless of how many statements ran
inside any one of them or whether two forks happened to sit at the same
nesting depth as siblings.

(`$BASH_SUBSHELL` -- the more obvious probe variable -- was tried first and
rejected: it reports NESTING DEPTH, not fork count, so N sibling `$(printf
...)` substitutions at the same depth, run back to back with no trace line
ever falling back to depth 0 between them, undercounts to "however many
depth increases occurred" rather than N. Measured directly against the pre-
#665 slug-sed builder below: the depth-transition count came back 2 for a
builder that pays 22 real forks. `$BASHPID` does not have this failure mode
because two sibling subshells are still two distinct child processes.)

Every "must not fork" assertion here is paired with a "must fork" positive
control using the SAME harness and (where possible) the SAME call shape,
still written as `$(...)` -- so a broken harness that sees no forks anywhere
cannot pass silently (the negative-assertion-needs-a-positive-control rule
this repo's CLAUDE.md states directly).

Two closely-read positive controls matter more than they look:

* `config()`'s own pre-existing `( LC_ALL=C; [[ ... ]] )` key-shape guard is
  ALREADY a subshell, deliberately (its own comment in log.sh explains why:
  scoping the locale override to one match). That fork is NOT what #665
  removes and this file does not claim otherwise -- `config_into()` still
  pays it. What #665 removes is the OUTER command-substitution fork
  `$(config ...)` adds on top of that -- so the pinned claim is "config_into
  forks exactly one FEWER time than `$(config ...)` does", not "config_into
  forks zero times".

* `log()`'s message control-byte scrub (`$(printf ... | LC_ALL=C tr ...)`)
  is deliberately NOT touched here. #621 tried twice to remove it (a bracket
  class, then a byte-range check) and both went red on live CI in ways this
  repo could not reproduce locally, so #621 was closed as not worth the
  fragility and log() forks this unconditionally, same as before #621. The
  timestamp fork (`$(_remember_date ...)`) is a different site and IS
  removed -- `log()`'s total fork count drops from 2 to 1, not to 0.
