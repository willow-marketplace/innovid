"""Shell-level tests for the BRANCH resolution block in scripts/save-session.sh.

The block defines the ``| <branch>`` identity slot of each
``## HH:MM | <branch>`` memory header. It must satisfy a five-case truth
table:

  1. ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH`` is set                 -> use it (env wins).
  2. ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH`` unset, ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD`` set and it
     prints a non-empty value on stdout            -> use that value.
  3. ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH`` unset, ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD`` set but it exits
     non-zero, or prints nothing                    -> fall through past it.
  4. Neither set, ``$PROJECT_DIR`` is a git repo   -> ``git branch --show-current``.
  5. Neither set, no git repo                       -> literal ``unknown``.

Plus: ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH`` set to the empty string is treated as unset
(``${VAR:-default}``, not ``${VAR-default}``), and ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD``
is invoked as ``$REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD "$SESSION_ID"`` (#481) -- concurrent
sessions of one project share ``$PROJECT_DIR``, so the git fallback alone
cannot distinguish them; ``$SESSION_ID`` is the value already in scope that
does.

Tests source the exact resolution block out of the live ``save-session.sh``
file (between the ``BRANCH RESOLUTION START``/``END`` markers) rather than
reasserting a copy here -- if the block ever changes without an intentional
test update, these cases fail loudly.
