"""post-tool-hook.sh's basename-derived SESSION_ID reaches save-session.sh's
argv unguarded, the same class #610 fixed for the stdin route (#620).

When STDIN_SESSION_ID is absent or untrusted, post-tool-hook.sh falls back to
deriving SESSION_ID from the TRANSCRIPT basename
(``SESSION_ID="${TRANSCRIPT##*/}"``, stripped of ``.jsonl``,
post-tool-hook.sh:604-605). Unlike STDIN_SESSION_ID -- guarded at its point of
entry by a case statement that rejects a leading dash (post-tool-hook.sh:419-423,
#610) -- this basename value flowed straight into
``nohup "$SAVE_SCRIPT" "$SESSION_ID" ... &`` (post-tool-hook.sh:910) with no
guard at all.

NOTE on impact, established while writing this test (self-review, see the PR
body): for THIS route specifically, save-session.sh's own auto-detect
(``if [ -z "$SESSION_ID" ]``, save-session.sh:198-200) reads the SAME session
directory with the SAME "newest .jsonl" rule whenever the value it was handed
does not survive its arg loop as a positional -- which is exactly what
happens for both recognised flags ("--dry", "--force"). Because the
basename-derived id and the transcript save-session.sh would independently
re-discover are the same file, guarding this call site does not change
save-session.sh's *behaviour* here the way it did for #610 (where a crafted
stdin id could be paired with an UNRELATED, valid transcript_path,
decoupling the two): a transcript literally named "--dry.jsonl" hits
save-session.sh's own session-id-shape check
(``^[a-f0-9][a-f0-9-]*$``, save-session.sh:209-212) either way and exits 1
with "invalid session ID" rather than silently entering DRY_RUN. What this
test pins is narrower and still worth having: the ARGV save-session.sh
actually receives, which is the reason #610/#600/#576 guard this same class
of value at every entry point rather than trusting a downstream script to
keep saving it -- a downstream change that widens the arg loop or drops the
validate anchor would silently reopen exactly the #610 impact for this
route with no signal here.
