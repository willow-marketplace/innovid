"""Gemini CLI hook manifest (#456).

`.gemini/settings.json` is the manifest `gemini hooks migrate --from-claude`
produces when fed this repo's real `hooks/hooks.json` (observed against a
live `gemini-cli 0.57.0` install, not reconstructed from the issue's prose --
see the #456 changelog fragment and README section). The migration renames
event keys only; it carries every command string through verbatim, including
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, which Gemini CLI never sets. #407 already fixed this
for our own scripts by reading `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` first
(`scripts/resolve-paths.sh`, `pipeline/host.PLUGIN_ROOT_VARS`), so the
manifest as first checked in spelled it the vendor-neutral way rather than
ship the raw migration output unedited.

`${PLUGIN_ROOT}` turned out not to help either: #533 found, from Gemini
CLI's own bundled docs, that a plain project-scope settings.json gets no
plugin-root variable at all -- `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` was never going to resolve
there any more than `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` would have. This file's two
tests that used to pin `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` now pin `${GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR}`
instead, the variable that actually does resolve to a project-rooted path
in that scope; see tests/test_gemini_extension_533.py for the fuller pin
and for the new `${extensionPath}`-based distributable extension #533 adds
alongside this file.

This is a manifest lint only, the same limit test_codex_manifest_410.py
states for its own file: no `gemini` binary runs in CI, so these tests prove
the file is well-formed JSON, uses Gemini's own documented event names, and
never spells the Claude-only variable -- not that Gemini actually loads it
or fires a hook (that is explicitly out of scope per the #456 issue itself:
"not yet observed", and #532 means it still is not observed).
