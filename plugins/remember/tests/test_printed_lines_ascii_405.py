"""Regression pin for #405: EVERY script under scripts/ and hooks.d/, and
every printed message under pipeline/, must be pure ASCII, never just
session-start-hook.sh (#367).

#367 pinned the file-wide decision -- printed lines must never carry a byte
outside ASCII -- for session-start-hook.sh alone. #405 is the same decision
made once for the whole scripts/ tree instead of per file, because #367's own
reasoning (mojibake on a cp1252 Windows console) does not stop at that file's
boundary: doctor.sh and post-tool-hook.sh grew non-ASCII printed lines in the
very same delta that pinned session-start-hook.sh.

#425: the #405 sweep was scoped to scripts/*.sh (non-recursive) and never
looked at hooks.d/, which ships shell too -- post-tool-hook.sh:139 documents
that hooks.d/after_post_tool/ is part of the distribution, and
hooks.d/after_save/50-git-backup.sh and
hooks.d/before_session_start/50-git-restore.sh both printf a multi-sentence
warning straight at a user's console exactly like the files #405 already
covers. hooks.d/ is inside the #405 decision's boundary for the same reason
scripts/ is: these files run on a user's machine and print to a console that
may be reading cp1252. The scan below now walks hooks.d/ recursively (its
subdirectories are per-phase, e.g. hooks.d/after_save/), because the #405
sweep's own docstring already called itself "the same decision made once for
the whole scripts/ tree" while covering barely more than half the shipped
shell.

Scope, same as #367: PRINTED lines only -- bytes that reach stdout or stderr.
Comments are untouched; the em-dashes and arrows in this repo's prose are not
the subject of this rule.

Boundary decision (#405's own): pipeline/*.py is in scope too, and for a
sharper reason than cosmetics. pipeline/log.py's log() and pipeline/haiku.py's
_warn() fall back to print(..., file=sys.stderr) exactly like scripts/log.sh
falls back to echo ... >&2 -- but Python's print() DOES perform an encode
step against the console's codepage (unlike bash's echo), so a non-ASCII
printed message there is not cosmetic mojibake, it is the actual
UnicodeEncodeError crash #367's own issue said could not happen in bash.

One documented exception: scripts/bench-slug.sh's benchmark deliberately
prints a non-ASCII test path (cafe/nihongo/emoji) as its own subject matter --
it is a developer-only benchmark demonstrating non-ASCII path handling, not a
diagnostic read by an end user, and stripping the bytes would remove the
thing being measured. Every other non-ASCII byte in that same file (the
decorative "-- see lib-slug.sh" line) is fixed like everywhere else; only the
one benchmark-input line is carved out, by name, below.
