"""Regression tests for #519: 2 more Windows backslash-blindness sites that
survived #517's sweep -- bootstrap-dirs.sh's in-project `.gitignore` write
and 50-git-restore.sh's legacy-mode guard. Same class as #487/#517: a bash
`case`/parameter-expansion pattern match recognises only '/' as a path
separator, never a backslash, while REMEMBER_DIR/PROJECT_DIR arrive
backslash-separated on msys/cygwin (resolve-paths.sh's own
_remember_normalize_win_path).

Uses tests/_glob_backslash_517.py's shared extraction/run mechanism -- see
that module's own docstring for why the extracted-block technique is
needed at all (a real end-to-end run cannot reproduce the shape on a POSIX
CI runner).

Site 1 (bootstrap-dirs.sh) needs a REAL directory for its `-d` guard and
its actual `.gitignore` write to be observable at all -- a fully synthetic,
non-existent REMEMBER_DIR would make the write fail structurally (ENOENT)
regardless of whether the case pattern matched, indistinguishable from the
bug itself. The trick (same spirit as #487's own test, which keeps the
GLOB argument synthetic while the real files stay on real forward-slash
paths): only the single path component immediately after $_mem_proj is
given a literal backslash in its own name -- POSIX mkdir/open treat
backslash as an ordinary filename character, so
`tmp_path / "proj\\store"` is a perfectly legal, real, on-disk directory,
distinct from `tmp_path / "proj"`. `_mem_proj` never needs to exist as a
directory itself; it is only ever a string operand in the case pattern.
That reproduces exactly the shape a real Windows path has at this
boundary (a backslash where the pattern expects '/') while still letting
the surrounding `-d` guard and the real `.gitignore` write succeed for
real, so the test can assert the actual file lands on disk, not just that
some code path was reached.

Site 2 (50-git-restore.sh) is a pure string computation (REPO_ROOT/SLUG
via parameter-expansion split) with no filesystem interaction of its own,
so it is tested the same way lib-case-divergence.sh's own #517 split is:
a synthetic backslash-laden REMEMBER_DIR, no real directory needed.

    The real store directory this class creates has to be built
    differently per HOST platform (CI job 100931242415/100931242372,
    windows-latest 3.9/3.12, self-review-round-2 finding): on a POSIX host
    (macOS/Linux CI, local dev), backslash is an ordinary filename
    character, never a separator, so faking a Windows-native boundary
    needs one real directory whose own on-disk NAME literally contains a
    backslash (`tmp_path / "proj\\store"`, ONE component, no
    parents=True). On a native-Windows host (windows-latest), the
    OPPOSITE is true: backslash IS the real separator, both for Python's
    own `Path.mkdir()` and for Git Bash's own MSYS-translated file I/O --
    `tmp_path / "proj\\store"` there is TWO components, and `mkdir()`
    (no `parents=True`) fails with `WinError 3: The system cannot find
    the path specified` because "proj" was never created, which is
    exactly what CI hit. On that host an ORDINARY nested `mkdir` (two
    real components, `parents=True`) already produces exactly the fully
    backslash-separated path this test needs, with no special
    construction at all -- `str(store_dir)` on native Windows is already
    all-backslash by construction.

    The gate is now duplicated INLINE in bootstrap-dirs.sh rather than
    calling the shared `_remember_forward_slash` (scripts/resolve-paths.sh,
    #517) directly -- self-review/CI finding, job 100934963344
    (ubuntu-latest 3.9): bootstrap-dirs.sh's own USAGE header claims every
    caller sources resolve-paths.sh first, but tests/test_external_data_dir.py
    and tests/test_worktree_memory.py's own `_run_bootstrap()` harnesses
    (real, pre-existing end-to-end tests) source only detect-tools.sh and
    bootstrap-dirs.sh, never resolve-paths.sh -- so `_remember_forward_slash`
    was genuinely undefined there, silently degrading the whole gate to
    "never matches, .gitignore never written" for EVERY REMEMBER_DIR, not
    just a backslash-laden one. This class's own `setup` therefore no
    longer needs `_FORWARD_SLASH_FN` prepended -- the extracted block is
    self-contained, exactly like TestGitRestoreLegacyGuardSplit's own.
