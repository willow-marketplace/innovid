"""sniff_file_envelope_status() folds two different exhaustion causes into
the same ``unreadable=False`` return (#556): a file whose scan hit
``_ENVELOPE_SNIFF_SCAN_CAP`` unplaceable lines and gave up (#543's own cap),
and a file that was read to genuine exhaustion (or found empty) and simply
never named a known host shape. The caller-visible tuple could not tell
these apart, so pipeline/haiku.py's fallback warning named only two causes
("unreadable or an unrecognised shape") for a message that can also be
produced by a third: the cap.

This adds a third element to the returned tuple, ``capped``, true only when
the scan gave up at the cap rather than genuinely exhausting the file.
Every "must fire" case (the cap is actually hit) is paired with a "must not
fire" control (a file that is genuinely exhausted, never capped) so the
test cannot pass by reporting every unrecognised file as capped.
