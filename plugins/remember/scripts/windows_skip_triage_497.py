"""Recompute the live set of win32 blanket-skip test modules (#497).

`grep -rl "pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif" tests | xargs grep -l "win32"`
-- the command #497's own brief and `scripts/report_windows_skip_floor.py`'s
docstring both cite (92, then 107) -- over-counts. It requires only that both
substrings appear *somewhere* in the file, not that they form one real
`pytestmark` assignment. On this tree it catches a docstring that merely
*quotes* `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)` as prose (`test_bash_runner_432.py`,
`test_sanctioned_divergence_state_440.py`) and, more importantly, files that
already carry the `resolve_bash()`-style route -- a local `_find_bash()` whose
own probe order happens to test `sys.platform == "win32"` and whose skip
reason is `"bash not available"` / `"Git Bash not found (...)"`, not a blanket
win32 skip at all (`test_stale_config_sweep_362.py`, `test_tmpdir_cleanup.py`,
`test_trap_quoting_375.py`, `test_log_sh.py`, `test_migration.py`,
`test_security_fixes.py`, plus the four files this issue's own #432 already
converted). Counted on this tree at the base commit for #497 (718a10f): the
grep-shape check finds 107 files; this AST-based check, requiring an actual
module-level `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)` assignment (a bare call,
or one arm of a list/tuple of marks -- pytest ORs a list, so any one arm
mentioning `win32` is a real blanket skip, e.g. `test_slug_vectors_294.py`)
whose test expression mentions `win32`, finds 95. An earlier version of this
scanner only matched the bare-call form and undercounted at 94, missing the
list-form file above -- caught by review, not by the drift-detection test
below, since that test recomputes its own baseline from this same function
and so cannot see a module class the function itself never looked for.

Used by both `docs/windows-skip-triage.md`'s own generation and by
`tests/test_windows_skip_triage_497.py`, which recomputes this set fresh on
every run and diffs it against the file the doc lists -- so the doc cannot
silently drift out of sync with the tree the way the issue itself describes
happening to the grep-based count.
