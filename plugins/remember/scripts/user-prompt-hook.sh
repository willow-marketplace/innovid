# user-prompt-hook.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook for the Remember plugin
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Runs on every user prompt submission. Injects the current timestamp
#   so the agent knows what time it is during the conversation.
#
# USAGE
#   Called automatically by Claude Code's UserPromptSubmit hook system.
#   Not intended for manual invocation.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT   Plugin install directory (set by Claude Code)
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR   Project root (default: .)
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   lib-clock.sh    (the timestamp, without a process where bash can do it)
#   lib-env-cache.sh (replays an already-resolved REMEMBER_DIR / REMEMBER_TZ)
#   jq (for config.json reading via log.sh — first run in a project only)
#   log.sh (for timezone, dispatch via hooks.d/ — first run in a project only)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   Always (hook must not block the agent)
#
# OUTPUT
#   Prints "[HH:MM TZ — username]" to stdout. The `prompt_stamp` config option
#   narrows that to "[username]" (`stable`) or to nothing (`off`) — see #301.
#
# COST (#227)
#   This runs on every prompt the user submits and the user waits for it. It
#   used to source resolve-paths.sh → bootstrap-dirs.sh → log.sh to print one
#   line: 19 processes on macOS, 27 on the Windows-ARM64-under-QEMU box
#   @MargeryOlethea measured, where per-spawn costs of 150-800ms turned it into
#   a p50 of 8718ms — blocking, on every prompt, with 6 outright timeouts in 256
#   runs. It now takes the chain only when it has no already-resolved answer to
#   replay, which is once per project per config change.
#
#   That matters more here than the numbers suggest: on UserPromptSubmit a
#   non-zero exit does not merely error, it BLOCKS THE PROMPT AND ERASES WHAT
#   THE USER TYPED. Every process this does not start is an opportunity to fail
#   that it does not take.
#

# --- Nested summarizer: there is no project here (#204) ---
# Normally this guard lives in resolve-paths.sh, which the fast path below does
# not reach. It has to hold for every hook this plugin registers — the whole
# point of #204 was that any one of them alone scaffolds a memory directory
# under the summarizer's temp dir and injects into its context.
[ -n "${REMEMBER_NESTED_SUMMARIZER:-}" ] && exit 0

# --- REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD (#417, #444) ---
# resolve-paths.sh falls back to this variable when CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is
# unset (#411). Cleared here first and unconditionally, before anything below
# could set or inherit it -- the #417 leak this closes is a DIFFERENT
# session's SessionStart-exported value surviving into a hook that has not
# validated it, or (on a host that reuses one process environment across
# invocations) a stale value this same hook wrote on a PREVIOUS run. This
# hook now offers its own stdin `cwd` further down (#444, #479), but that
# read has to happen after this unset, never instead of it, or the #417 leak
# reopens. Clearing it here is cheap and unconditionally
# correct regardless of whether that reuse is possible on any supported host:
# on the common path CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is already set and this arm never
# runs anyway.
unset REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD

# --- REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH (#424) ---
# pipeline/host.transcript_path() trusts this variable once it names a real
# file, and pipeline/extract.py's find_session() returns that value BEFORE
# the traversal validator (_validate_session_id) ever runs -- so a value set
# anywhere in the ambient environment reads an arbitrary file straight into
# the memory store, no `../` required. Only session-start-hook.sh and
# session-end-hook.sh have a legitimate transcript_path to offer, extracted
# fresh from their own stdin payload on every run. This hook has none and
# must not silently consult whatever the process environment already holds,
# for the same reason and under the same unestablished-reachability
# reasoning as the REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD unset just above (#417).
unset REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH

# --- Host-conditional stdout shape (#451) ---
# Claude Code treats this hook's plain stdout as `additionalContext` -- that
# is what the prompt stamp below is for, and every existing regression test
# (#301, #280) pins it byte-for-byte. Codex's own UserPromptSubmit parser
# does something different: it sniffs the first non-whitespace byte of
# stdout, and `{` or `[` means "this claims to be my JSON contract"
# (codex-rs/hooks/src/engine/output_parser.rs::looks_like_json, read from
# openai/codex @ 2026-08-29 -- Codex ships no separate hooks.md). That
# contract is user-prompt-submit.command.output.schema.json
# (codex-rs/hooks/schema/generated/), consumed by
# events/user_prompt_submit.rs::parse_completed. The plain stamp this hook
# has always printed, "[HH:MM TZ -- user]", opens with `[` -- so Codex tries
# to read it as that JSON contract, fails, and reports the hook run
# HookRunStatus::Failed even though nothing failed. Plain text that does
# NOT open with `{`/`[` is accepted by that same parser and appended as
# additionalContext with status Completed, so the fix is not "never print
# the stamp on this host", it is "print it inside the envelope Codex's own
# schema names" -- see the tail of this file.
#
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is the signal used for this exact distinction in
# resolve-paths.sh's own ENVIRONMENT block: Claude Code always sets it,
# Codex documents no such variable and never does (live-confirmed, #463),
# and until #456 this repo believed Gemini CLI never does either. #456
# found that belief wrong: Gemini CLI's own bundled docs list
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR as a compatibility alias it DOES set
# (tests/test_gemini_project_dir_var_456.py) -- unverified live, #532.
#
# #534 considered replacing this with a Codex-specific signature check
# instead (CODEX_SESSION_ID/CODEX_THREAD_ID, the pair
# pipeline/host.py's CODEX.signature_vars uses) so the JSON envelope would
# be Codex-only by construction rather than riding on "CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
# happens to be unset". That was tried and REJECTED: #465 already measured,
# live, that neither CODEX_SESSION_ID nor CODEX_THREAD_ID reaches a process
# Codex spawns as a HOOK (this script is one, registered in
# hooks/hooks.codex.json) -- only a Codex TOOL-SHELL command sees them
# (see pipeline/haiku.py's own note, and tests/test_codex_signature_463.py's
# docstring). tests/fixtures/codex-env-463.txt, the fixture that pair is
# pinned against, was itself captured from a tool-shell `codex exec … "run:
# env | …"`, not from inside a hook -- so gating THIS script on those two
# variables would silently disable the envelope on every real Codex
# UserPromptSubmit invocation and reopen #451/#452 (every prompt on Codex
# reads Failed again). Kept on CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR instead: still exactly
# right for Codex (confirmed absent, live), and for Gemini this flag now
# also matches Gemini's own claimed behaviour (present -> plain stdout) --
# REASONED, not observed, for any host besides Codex 0.150.1, same limit
# as before #534. The JSON envelope is what Codex's own schema documents,
# and is no worse than a bracket that collides with Codex's heuristic on
# every host it has not been checked against either.

# --- REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD from stdin (#444, moved ahead of the cache lookup
# below for #479) ---
# resolve-paths.sh's REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD fallback (#411) only ever gets a
# value from session-start-hook.sh and session-end-hook.sh, which is why a
# host that never sets CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (Codex -- confirmed live,
# tests/fixtures/codex-env-463.txt) hit the FATAL in resolve-paths.sh on
# this hook before #411/#444: the #417 unset above left it correct but with
# no legitimate source of its own. Gemini CLI's own bundled docs say it DOES
# set CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (#456, unverified live -- #532), so this fallback
# is not what makes Gemini resolvable any more, but it stays correct and
# still needed for Codex and any other host that genuinely leaves it unset.
# UserPromptSubmit carries `cwd` on its own stdin payload on all three
# hosts (#407's comparison table), so read it here regardless.
#
# THIS MUST RUN BEFORE _remember_env_cache_load BELOW (#479). That
# function's own key, _remember_env_cache_path, falls back to
# REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD when CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is unset (#469) -- which is
# still Codex's own case (confirmed live) and can be true of other hosts
# too, even though Gemini CLI's own docs now say it is not Gemini's (#456,
# unverified live -- #532). Before #479 this read lived
# inside the "cache missed" branch below, i.e. it only ever ran AFTER the
# cache lookup this very variable was meant to key had already failed for
# want of it: every UserPromptSubmit wrote a cache file and none ever read
# one back -- verbatim the #469 symptom, still present on the one hook #469
# exists to fix.
#
# Paying this unconditionally -- on the fast path too -- is a real change
# from the #227 reasoning further up this file, which is about FORKED
# processes (150-800ms each, per the COST section above). This read forks
# nothing: it is a bash builtin loop over stdin the host has already
# written and closed by the time this script starts, bounded in TIME only
# below. Measured 2026-09-01 on macOS/bash 3.2 (this read's own semantics):
# 50 runs of this exact read-and-parse loop against a realistic
# UserPromptSubmit payload averaged 8.5ms end-to-end, against 9.5ms for a
# no-op bash process doing nothing but consume the same stdin -- the loop's
# own marginal cost does not clear that measurement's noise floor. The
# alternative -- leaving the read on the slow path only -- keeps this hook
# with no working fast path at all on Codex, and on any other host that
# genuinely leaves CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR unset, which is the choice #479
# exists to make explicit rather than silent.
#
# WORST CASE, not just average case: before this change, a cache-HIT
# invocation never touched stdin at all, so it could never block on it.
# After this change every invocation, hit or miss, carries the same
# `read -t 1` ceiling the slow path already had -- a host that leaves the
# pipe open without writing/closing it now costs up to 1s on the hot path
# too, not 0ms. Accepted deliberately, not overlooked: `post-tool-hook.sh`
# already reads stdin unconditionally ahead of its own cache-load check
# (see its REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD block), on the hook that fires roughly ten
# times more often than this one, with no reported incident -- this is an
# extension of that same accepted tradeoff to a second hook, not a new
# risk class.
#
# Bounded in TIME only (`read -t 1`, never a tty), the same reasoning every
# other stdin-reading hook in this repo already carries: a blocking read
# here is not a slow prompt, it is a lost one (see the COST section above).
# bash 3.2 has no sub-second -t, hence 1.

# The same deliberately narrow extractor session-start-hook.sh uses: the
# key must be followed by nothing but whitespace and a colon before the
# value's opening quote, so a `cwd` appearing inside some other field is
# not mistaken for it.
#
# #494 -- REACHABILITY OF THE NESTED-BEFORE-TOP-LEVEL GAP (researched, not
# assumed): tests/test_stdin_extractor_top_level_wins_447.py pins that THIS
# function takes the FIRST `"cwd"` occurrence in the raw stdin text, so a
# same-named key nested inside some other field wins over the top-level one
# when it occurs earlier in the byte stream. Whether that shape is reachable
# from a real host was the open half of #447/#493, settled here by reading
# all three hosts' hook payload schemas:
#
#   Claude Code -- every hook payload (docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/
#   hooks) puts `cwd` in the shared top-level object (session_id,
#   transcript_path, cwd, permission_mode, hook_event_name, ...), and
#   `tool_input`/`tool_response` -- the only nested objects a hook payload
#   ever carries -- are declared AFTER it in every documented example. No
#   built-in tool's input schema uses a `cwd` parameter. NOT source-verified
#   (Claude Code's hook serializer is not open source): docs-observed only.
#
#   Codex -- SOURCE-VERIFIED (codex-rs/core/src/hook_runtime.rs): the
#   request structs declare `cwd` before `tool_input`, and serde's default
#   struct serialization preserves declaration order, so `cwd` is
#   guaranteed to serialize first. The built-in shell tool's own working-
#   directory parameter is named `workdir`, not `cwd`.
#
#   Gemini CLI -- docs (github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli, docs/hooks/
#   reference.md) show the same shape: `cwd` in the shared base object,
#   `tool_input` appended after it for BeforeTool/AfterTool. The built-in
#   shell tool's directory parameter is named `dir_path`, not `cwd`.
#   NOT source-verified (spread/construction order not confirmed): docs-
#   observed only.
#
# The remaining theoretical opening on all three hosts is a THIRD-PARTY MCP
# tool whose author names one of ITS OWN input parameters `cwd` -- `tool_input`
# for an MCP call is passed through as an opaque value on every host checked,
# unconstrained by any schema this plugin controls. But that still does not
# reach the gap this file's extractor has: on every host and every payload
# shape found, `tool_input` (the only place such a key could appear) is
# positioned AFTER the top-level `cwd` field, not before it -- so even an
# adversarial MCP tool parameter named `cwd` lands in the SAFE "nested-after"
# case (tests/test_stdin_extractor_top_level_wins_447.py's first test), never
# the "nested-before" one this comment is about. The gap the second test pins
# is real as a property of THIS extractor's mechanism (first-occurrence
# scanning, not top-level-aware), but no known, currently-shipped host payload
# reaches it -- and a host is free to reorder its own schema in a future
# release, which is why this stays documentation and a synthetic-input test
# rather than a load-bearing guarantee. #340/#344's standing decision not to
# acquire a JSON parser for a hook that must survive a broken install is
# unchanged by this finding.
