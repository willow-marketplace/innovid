# session-start-hook.sh — SessionStart hook for the Remember plugin
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Runs at the beginning of every Claude Code session. Performs three jobs:
#   1. Injects memory files (identity, core memories, today, now, recent,
#      archive) into the session context via stdout. At source=compact only
#      identity is injected and the rest are named — see #339, below.
#   2. Recovers the most recent missed session by launching save-session.sh
#      with --force in the background.
#   3. Triggers background maintenance: consolidation of past-day staging
#      files and team memory digest refresh.
#   4. Dispatches before_session_start / after_session_start via hooks.d/.
#
# USAGE
#   Called automatically by Claude Code's SessionStart hook system.
#   Not intended for manual invocation.
#
# STDIN
#   The SessionStart hook payload, as JSON. Only `session_id` is read, and only
#   to answer "which transcript in this directory is ours" — without it neither
#   recovery nor the capture-gap check can tell the current session from the
#   previous one, and both used to assume the answer from mtime position (#270).
#
#   The read is bounded in TIME and only in time — `read -t 1`, and never from a
#   tty — for the reason post-tool-hook.sh records: a hook that blocks on stdin
#   is not a slow session start, it is one that never starts.
#
#   The hook CONSUMES stdin, so the payload is re-published to hooks.d/
#   listeners around the dispatches, on the same three-state contract
#   post-tool-hook.sh established (#266).
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT   Plugin install directory (set by Claude Code)
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR   Project root (default: .)
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   jq (for config.json reading)
#   save-session.sh (for session recovery)
#   run-consolidation.sh (for staging compression)
#   log.sh (for dispatch via hooks.d/)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   Always (hook must not block session startup)
#
# OUTPUT
#   Prints memory content to stdout for injection into session context.
#   Sections: === HANDOFF ===, === MEMORY ===, === MEMORY CONSOLIDATION ===
#   hooks.d/ listeners may add their own (e.g., === TEAM ===).

# --- Where this script lives ---
# Parameter expansion, not three `dirname` forks (#230) — the same pattern
# log.sh and user-prompt-hook.sh already use. A path with no slash in it
# leaves the filename behind, not a directory; `dirname` answered "." and
# this must too.

# --- Nested summarizer: there is no project here (#204) ---
# The same fast-path guard post-tool-hook.sh, user-prompt-hook.sh and
# session-end-hook.sh already carry ahead of their own stdin capture, added
# here for the same reason (#411): stdin is now read BEFORE resolve-paths.sh
# is sourced (below), so REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD is available to it. Without a
# guard here, every nested `claude -p` summarizer child would pay for the
# bounded stdin read before ever reaching the guard resolve-paths.sh still
# carries for every OTHER caller. Exiting here is strictly cheaper than
# before the #411 reorder, not more expensive: previously the guard fired
# inside resolve-paths.sh, after umask and plugin-root resolution had
# already run; now it fires before any of that, and before the stdin read.

# ── Read stdin once, before resolving paths (#411) ────────────────────────
# `session_id` / `transcript_path` / `source` used to be extracted here, just
# after resolve-paths.sh ran. `cwd` (below) is new, and resolve-paths.sh needs
# it BEFORE it resolves PROJECT_DIR — a stdin `cwd` is the fallback once
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is unset, which is exactly the host that does not set it
# — so the capture moves up ahead of the source line. stdin is single-read
# and three other hooks already share this shape; nothing here may consume it
# twice.
#
# The read is bounded in TIME and only in time — `read -t 1`, and never from
# a tty — for the reason post-tool-hook.sh records: a hook that blocks on
# stdin is not a slow session start, it is one that never starts. bash 3.2
# has no sub-second -t, hence 1.

# The same deliberately narrow extractor post-tool-hook.sh and

# every result is validated below before anything is done with it.
#
# #494: whether a real host payload can nest a `cwd` key AHEAD of this
# field is researched in scripts/user-prompt-hook.sh, next to its own

# ── The cwd the host handed us (#411) ──────────────────────────────────────
# Every host puts `cwd` on the SessionStart payload (#407's comparison table).
# Claude Code always also publishes it as CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR; Codex never
# does (live-confirmed, #463); Gemini CLI's own bundled docs now say it DOES
# publish CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR too, as a compatibility alias (#456, unverified
# live — #532; used to be believed it did not, #534). Exported for
# resolve-paths.sh to consult as its fallback once CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is
# unset — precedence is CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, then this, then the existing
# .claude/remember layout derivation, then the existing failure; a stdin
# `cwd` that disagrees with a SET CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR must not win, which is
# why resolve-paths.sh checks CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR first and this is read
# regardless of whether it turns out to be used.
#
# Validated the same way REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH is, below: data from a host
# payload, at the point of entry, not the point of use. A project directory
# legitimately contains slashes and dots, so it cannot share
# CURRENT_SESSION_ID's character allowlist — only a carriage return or a raw
# newline is rejected (the read loop above already strips every line
# terminator before HOOK_STDIN is assembled, so the newline arm is a belt no
# buckle can ever need — kept in case a future change to that loop ever
# preserves one). Whether the value actually names a directory is decided in
# resolve-paths.sh, which falls back to the existing derivation when it does
# not.

# session: a capture-gap warning about a session old enough to predate the
# evidence store, and a recovery force-save aimed away from the tail it exists
# to rescue.
#
# #206 named the enabler and shipped the other half of the fix: this hook never
# read its stdin, so it had neither `source` nor `session_id` and could not
# exclude itself. Only `session_id` is needed for THAT job: excluding our own
# transcript by id is correct at EVERY source, so there is no source list to

# captured" while the save record says it was captured 72/72 is reporting on
# its own bookkeeping, not on anything you lost (#206).
#
# Ask whether this session was EVER saved, not whether it owns the one
# slot: positions are keyed by session now, and the old equality test
# force-saved an already-saved session whenever another had saved since
# (issue #140). Legacy single-slot files still answer correctly.
# Type-check the value, not just the key: the python readers require an
# int, so `has($id)` alone would call a corrupt {"id": null} entry saved
# while they resume it from 0 — re-summarizing the whole span, which is
# what #140 exists to prevent.
# isinfinite guard: JSON has no infinity literal, but 1e400 overflows to
# one, and floor(infinite) == infinite — so it would read as a line
# number here while python's is_integer() rejects it. jq would then call
# the session saved and the recovery force-save below would never fire,

# Args: $1 — session id. Exit 0 if last-save.json records it as saved.
#
# _jq_fallback's own shim (scripts/detect-tools.sh) only ever evaluates
# dotted-path lookups and drops every `--arg`/`--argjson` pair entirely
# (#667): it eats each leading `-*` token into a flags variable it never
# reads, then treats the first non-flag token as the query and the one
# after it as the file -- fed `--arg id "$1" "$SAVED_QUERY"
# "$LAST_SAVE_FILE"`, that lands on query="id", file="$1" (the session id,

# ── The slug, written down once, for callers that are not bash (#294) ─────
# The slug is a pure function of PROJECT_DIR and PROJECT_DIR does not change
# mid-session, so a caller in another language had no reason to recompute it —
# and no way to ask for it except by sourcing lib-slug.sh in a subshell, once
# per tool call. The reporter of #294 drives this plugin from PowerShell and
# answered that by maintaining a port of session_dir_slug, which is how the
# long-path divergence was found: a second implementation of the one function
# whose disagreements are silent.
#
# So it is written here, where PROJECT_PATH_SLUG already exists two lines
# above. This costs one `mv`; the per-tool-call path is not touched at all,
# which is deliberate and is asserted by
# tests/test_session_slug_record_294.py::test_the_per_tool_call_path_is_not_touched.
#
# In tmp/, with the locks, the cooldown markers and the delivery record: it
# names one machine's session and one machine's absolute paths, and #285 is
# what happens when that kind of state is committed like memory. The git
# backup already excludes the whole directory.
#
# THREE STATES, NOT TWO. An empty slug is not an absence — it resolves to
# ~/.claude/projects/ ITSELF, a directory that exists and holds every
# project's transcripts, so a reader that cannot tell "nothing was written"
# from "the slug is empty" reads someone else's session and never knows. The
# record therefore always carries a status, and never carries a `slug=` key it
# cannot fill: absent means this never ran, status=unavailable means it ran
# and could not answer, status=ok means the value is usable.
#
# NO TIMESTAMP, deliberately. The slug is a pure function of the path, so a
# record written by a long-dead session is still correct; only a record
# written by a DIFFERENT project is wrong, and worktrees make that reachable —
# they share a REMEMBER_DIR with the main checkout (#56) while keeping their
# own PROJECT_DIR, so the last session to start owns this file. `project_dir`

# ── And somewhere a caller can NAME, in the layout we ship (#297) ─────────
# The record above answers "what is the slug", and in the layout
# config.user.example.json ships — "data_dir": "~/.remember/{slug}", under a
# _purpose that says to copy it — it answers from inside a directory the slug
# names. A caller holding project_dir and the template could not open it
# without already knowing what it says. That was written down as one documented
# hole when #296 shipped; it is the recommended configuration, and those are
# the installs most likely to have a non-bash caller in the first place.
#
# NOTHING IS DERIVED FROM project_dir. The alternative shape — a second copy at
# <store_root>/tmp/session-slug-<key from project_dir> — needs a key both sides
# compute the same way, which is a second algorithm over the project path, and
# deleting exactly that is what #294 and #296 were for. A language-neutral
# encoding does not escape it either: base64 of an N-byte path is 4*ceil(N/3),
# so the 260-character paths #294 was about come out at 348 bytes and the
# 300-character vector in tests/slug_vectors.py at 400, past the 255-byte
# filename limit everywhere — and truncating to fit means appending a hash, a
# slug algorithm under a different name. An index matched on project_dir
# verbatim asks the caller to compute nothing at all, and keeps the property
# the reporter's own directory scan has: it cannot answer wrongly, only fail
# to answer.
#
# WRITTEN ONLY WHEN THE SLUG NAMES THE STORE. REMEMBER_STORE_ROOT is empty in
# the legacy layout and in a single-directory external store, where it would
# equal REMEMBER_DIR and duplicate a record that is already reachable — two
# files saying one thing, with a second chance to disagree. The common layout
# pays nothing for the external one, which is also why this is not in
# bootstrap-dirs.sh.
#
# ONE FILE, MANY WRITERS — the difference from the record, which each project
# owns outright. Several projects, and several worktrees of one project, start
# sessions against one store root, and a read-modify-write across them loses
# rows silently. So the rewrite is taken under the plugin's one lock primitive
# and published with mv; a session that cannot take the lock writes no row and
# says nothing, because the per-project record remains authoritative and this
# is a way to find it, not a second source of truth.
#
# NO TIMESTAMPS, for the reason _remember_write_slug_record gives above. A row
# for a directory since deleted can never be MATCHED by a caller holding a live
# project_dir, and if that path is ever recreated the row is still correct — so
# rows are never expired by age, and never pruned by testing whether the
# directory still exists, which would drop correct rows for anything on an
# unmounted share. The only bound is the row cap, and the ordering it drops by
# is position, maintained by this rewrite. That is not a staleness test and no
# reader may use it as one.
#
# AND NO ROW AT ALL for a project_dir this file cannot hold. A newline is legal
# on POSIX and a tab is legal too, and both are structure here. The record can
# take status=unavailable for that case; a row cannot, because it would have to
# be keyed by the very value it is refusing. A caller with such a path finds no
# row and falls back — the same outcome as this never having run, which is the
# honest one.

# ── Is this store known by a second spelling? (#298) ──────────────────────
# Git's index is case-sensitive where NTFS is not, so a store can be spelled
# one way on disk and another in the repository that backs it up. That costs
# nothing while it stays on a case-insensitive filesystem — measured on the
# reporter's own Windows box, where both spellings resolve to the same
# directory object — and it splits the store in two on a case-sensitive
# restore, which is the machine least likely to be looking.
#
# Session start, not the per-tool-call path: `session_dir_slug` runs on every
# tool call and #299 pinned that path byte-identical. The whole check costs one
# `git ls-tree` and only for a store that has its own repository; the disk half
# costs no fork at all, and a store in the legacy layout pays nothing because
# the library returns not-applicable before either probe runs.
#
# Disclosure only, and everything downstream keys off ONE fact: whether the
# finding has changed since last session. The record at tmp/case-divergence
# always holds the current answer in all four states, and is rewritten only
# when that answer is different — which is also what makes the steady state
# fork-free. The human-facing notice and the "could not check" log line fire
# on that same change. The condition never clears itself and is harmless
# today, so repeating it every session start would spend the one channel a
# human actually reads (#200) on wallpaper — the argument `_push_and_report`
# makes for its threshold, with the threshold replaced by "say it again only
# when it says something different". `/remember:doctor` re-runs the check live
# and reports every time, which is where someone who suspects a problem looks.

# ── Capture-gap detection (#200) ──────────────────────────────────────────
# Claude Code reads hook registrations at session start, so a plugin enabled
# MID-session has none of its hooks wired for that session: PostToolUse never
# fires and capture silently does nothing, for hours, with nothing in the logs
# to say so. The reporter lost a day to it and found only a lone session-start
# line.
#
# It cannot be caught while it is happening. Nothing inside a hook can see
# which hooks are registered — no env var, no file, and `/hooks` is a UI a
# script cannot invoke — and SessionStart's `source` field is only
# startup/resume/clear/compact/fork, so a plugin-enable is indistinguishable
# from a fresh start. Afterwards, though, the signature is exact: a session
# where SessionStart ran and PostToolUse never did.
#
# Judged by IDENTITY: post-tool-hook.sh writes the session id it saw, and if
# there is no record for the previous session's id then PostToolUse never ran
# for it. Comparing mtimes instead failed — bash 3.2's `-nt` works to the
# second, so a healthy session whose first tool call landed inside the same
# second as a stamp was reported as broken.
#
# By MEMBERSHIP, not equality (#206). The first cut stored one id, last-write-
# wins, which answers "which session most recently made a tool call" — a
# different question, and the two come apart the instant anything writes after
# X did. Two real installs found the seam:
#
#   * `/clear` does not mint a new session id. SessionStart fires while the
#     transcript, the id and the .jsonl all stay the same, and by then the
#     CURRENT session has made tool calls, so the slot holds the current id
#     while PREV_ID resolves to a genuinely older session. The mismatch was
#     structurally guaranteed, regardless of capture health — a warning on
#     every /clear, forever. Same for `compact` and `fork`.
#   * A session captured by the NEXT session's recovery block rather than its
#     own live saves. save-session.sh's recovery path never touches
#     capture-alive, so the slot names something else entirely, while
#     last-save.json records the session as fully saved. With the default
#     delta/cooldown thresholds this is the ordinary case for a short session,
#     not an edge case. (Reported independently by ca-sringert on #206.)
#
# Filtering on SessionStart's `source` — the fix the issue proposed — would
# silence the first and not the second, and would leave the store still unable
# to answer the question it is asked. So the store changed shape instead: a
# per-session marker directory, membership-tested. Three sources are accepted
# as evidence of capture, because a false positive here costs more than a
# false negative: this warning has no second chance to be believed, whereas a
# missed gap is still caught by /remember:doctor and, for the content itself,
# by the recovery block directly above.
#
# Deliberately NOT gated on "have we run before". A first cut required a prior
# session-start stamp, to keep a fresh install from being greeted with a
# warning — which sounds right and defeats the entire purpose: during a
# mid-session enable NO hook runs, so no stamp is written, so the one incident
# this exists to report was the exact case it stayed silent for. It could only
# ever have caught a recurrence.
#
# So the question is just "was the previous session captured", and the answer
# is reported whether or not this plugin has run before. A fresh install does
# see it once per project, which is honest: memory really does start here, and
# the wording says so.

# ── Handoff path: single (default) vs per-session (#363) ──────────────────
# Two or more INTERACTIVE sessions share one project store by design, even
# across git worktrees (_resolve_memory_project_dir, #56) — but the handoff
# was always one fixed file. The second session's /remember silently
# overwrote the first's, which then survived only in that session's own
# transcript, nowhere on disk. Distinct from #221/#222: those protect a
# PENDING handoff from a session that never writes one back; this is two
# sessions that each DO write one, to the same name.
#
# `handoff_mode` defaults to "single" — today's path, byte-identical — so an
# existing install's behaviour never changes underneath it. That means the
# clobber is not fixed in the field until a user opts in, and that trade is
# deliberate: every other behaviour-changing key in this file defaults off
# (data_dir, git_restore.enabled, reject_pattern) rather than rewriting an
# existing store's layout the moment a new version is installed.
#
# Per-session mode needs CURRENT_SESSION_ID (#270, sanitized above) to name
# the file. Its absence must never silently fall back to the shared name —
# that fallback IS the bug this exists to fix, only quieter, because the
# user believes per_session is protecting them. So an unresolved session id
# under a per_session request still resolves REMEMBER_HANDOFF to the shared
# file (nothing else this hook can do with no name to give it), but the
# hint below is withheld rather than pointed at it: the /remember skill's
# own hardcoded legacy fallback is the only thing that can still write
# there, and doing so leaves "no HANDOFF hint was given" visible in the
# transcript instead of a namespaced-looking path that never actually
# applied.

# ── Handoff path hint (consumed by the /remember skill) ───────────────────
# Emitted in external mode (unchanged, #56/#296) OR whenever this session
# resolved a per-session path — in LEGACY per_session mode REMEMBER_HANDOFF
# no longer equals the skill's own hardcoded fallback, so the hint stops
# being noise and becomes the only thing that points the skill at the
# right file.
#
# NOT withheld on degrade. An earlier version of this hook suppressed the
# hint outright whenever per_session was requested but had no usable
# session id, reasoning that pointing at the shared file under a mode
# claiming isolation was a lie. That reasoning was wrong in external mode:
# REMEMBER_HANDOFF still resolves to the one real external path there, so
# the hint is exactly as accurate as it always was, and withholding it
# reintroduced the bug the ORIGINAL external-mode hint existed to prevent —
# the /remember skill falling back to its hardcoded, project-relative
# default instead of the real external location. A reviewer of #363 caught
# this before it shipped.
#
# The honest fix is not silence, it is a visible line: when degraded, the
# hint still fires with the correct path, and a second line says so, so
# a user who set per_session does not read "namespaced" behaviour into a
# session that never got one.
# ── Cross-plugin promo (#574) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# A single-line systemMessage naming one NOT-YET-INSTALLED sibling plugin,
# from SessionStart only -- never SessionEnd, never PostToolUse, never
# UserPromptSubmit/Stop (measured to deliver too, per the issue's own probe,
# but deliberately not used: a per-turn channel turns "occasional" into
# "constant" with nobody touching a throttle). additionalContext is never an
# option here: it costs tokens on every session and is read by the model, not
# the human this is addressed to.
#
# promos.json (data, not shell) lives beside config.example.json so the copy
# can be added/reworded/dropped without a shell edit inside a hook that runs
# on every session start. PROMO_MSG is computed here, BEFORE the CTX capture
# below, because it must reach the plain-script scope that builds the final
# JSON -- a value set inside the `CTX=$( … )` subshell a few lines down would
# die with that subshell.
#
# REMEMBER_SUPPRESS_PROMO (#596): agy-session-start-hook.sh delegates here
# with this delegate's own stdout piped to /dev/null (Antigravity parses a
# command hook's stdout as protojson against its own schema, and this
# script's plain-text/hookSpecificOutput shape does not fit it -- #563), so
# any promo composed on that path is guaranteed to never reach a human, yet
# the emit block a few hundred lines down commits the throttle/rotation
# marker on any successful `printf`, and `printf` to /dev/null succeeds.
# That silently burned the whole `cooldowns.promo_seconds` window for
# every OTHER caller on the same machine, for a promo nobody ever saw.
#
# Fixed here rather than by having the emit block detect its own stdout
# target: this script has no reliable way to do that. `[ -t 1 ]` cannot
# tell "discarded" from "captured normally" -- a real Claude Code
# invocation ALSO pipes this hook's stdout through a non-tty read, so a
# tty check would suppress the marker for every legitimate caller too.
# Only the caller that KNOWS its own delegation discards stdout can act on
# that fact, so agy-session-start-hook.sh sets this flag before invoking
# us, and the whole promo feature -- selection AND marker -- is skipped on
# that path, leaving the cooldown/rotation state untouched for a real
# session to actually show the promo in.

# ── Last handoff (injected FIRST so it survives context-preview truncation) ─
# The session-start output can be large; the harness may deliver only a leading
# preview to the agent. Emit the previous session's handoff up top — before
# identity/memory — so it always lands in context.
#
# Delivery is recorded, never destructive (#221). This block used to truncate
# the slot the moment it read it, which is only correct if every session that
# starts will eventually write a handoff back. Plenty do not: a scheduled task
# whose prompt is read-only, a `claude -p` one-shot, a session abandoned before
# /remember. Each of those consumed the note meant for the next human session
# and left a 0-byte file, with nothing anywhere saying so.
#
# Detecting those sessions is not on the table — there is no signal for "this
# one will write a handoff back", and a guess that is wrong in the unsafe
# direction destroys data silently, which is the bug. So nothing is discarded
# until a replacement lands: /remember overwrites this same path, and the new
# content is what retires the old.
#
# The cost of keeping it is that the same note can be delivered more than once,
# and a stale handoff that reads as fresh is the same silent lie in new clothes.
# So a delivery record (fingerprint + first delivery + count) sits beside the
# slot, and any re-delivery of already-delivered content says so out loud.
#
# The record is PER-CLONE and lives in tmp/, with the locks and the cooldown
# markers — not beside the memory, where the git backup committed it like any
# other file (#285). The fingerprint is a cksum of the handoff CONTENT, so it
# matches on every machine that has that handoff, and a second machine's FIRST
# session was therefore told the note had already been delivered N times since
# another machine's clock. The record that exists to stop a stale handoff
# reading as fresh instead made a fresh one read as stale: the same lie
# inverted, and in the direction that suppresses action rather than duplicating
# it. Over-delivery is the safe direction and is already what #221 chose.
#
# There was no shared value it could have held instead. Two of the three fields
# are per-clone by construction — a wall clock and a session count — and only
# the fingerprint is globally meaningful, which is exactly the field that
# carried the harm. Sharing it also conflicted on every concurrent session
# start, and no merge driver repairs that: union emits both key sets and yields
# a malformed record, so this is the one file in the store where "keep both
# sides" is wrong.
# Per-session in per_session mode (#363) — REMEMBER_HANDOFF is now one file
# per session, and two sessions racing the SAME delivery record would corrupt
# it (a torn write, or one session's fingerprint overwriting another's) even
# though each has its own handoff to track. In single mode this is exactly

# ── Prune stale per-session delivery records (#373) ───────────────
# handoff_mode: per_session writes one remember.delivered.<session_id> per
# session (above) and nothing else in this codebase ever removes one -- the
# same class of leak #362 already fixed once, in the same directory, under a
# different filename ("could not tell" was not a state that leak had; this
# one does, because a delivery record's own session might still be live).
#
# Coupling this to the paired remember.<session_id>.md handoff slot was
# considered and rejected: that slot survives forever ON PURPOSE (#221), so a
# sweep keyed to it would reintroduce unbounded growth under a new name.
# Coupled instead to the one fact that actually answers "is this session
# over": whether Claude Code's own transcript for that session id still
# exists under $SESSIONS_DIR -- the same directory `previous_transcript`
# above already reads. A transcript still on disk means the session could
# still resume and write another handoff; one that is gone means the session
# is gone in every way this hook can observe.
#
# Three states, not two, matching the record left behind:
#   - transcript confirmed ABSENT, record older than GRACE_MIN -> pruned
#   - transcript confirmed PRESENT -> record is kept (not a bug: correct
#     under the coupling above)
#   - transcript ABSENT but record younger than GRACE_MIN, or $SESSIONS_DIR
#     cannot be listed at all -> nothing is touched. Could-not-tell must
#     never render as either of the other two, so on doubt the safe
#     direction is the one #221 already chose for the handoff itself: keep,
#     never guess-delete.
#
# #393: "transcript absent" alone does not mean "session gone". At
# source=startup (see the #270 comment above, lines 100-108) Claude Code
# creates a session's own transcript AFTER this hook has already run and
# already written that session's delivery record (line ~1012 above). For
# that window a live session's record is indistinguishable from a dead
# one's on the transcript check alone -- any concurrent session start
# would prune a record that is still in active use. GRACE_MIN arbitrates:
# a record newer than the window is not evidence the session is over,
# whatever the transcript says; the mtime check below is what makes this a
# third state instead of a coin flip. GRACE_MIN is REASONED, not measured
# against real Claude Code startup timing -- there is no instrumented
# figure for how long that gap runs, so this picks a duration wide enough
# that no plausible hook-to-transcript-creation delay approaches it, while
# staying bounded: a genuinely dead session's record is still pruned, just
# on the next session start after it ages past this window, never lost.

# ── Consolidation trigger ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# If past-day staging files exist, compress them in the background.
#
# Gated on source (#342): `compact` fires mid-session and changes nothing
# about whether yesterday's staging is worth compressing — the #339 report
# measured `compact` re-triggering this 82 times across 50 sessions, against
# `startup`'s 180, all spawning the same work again. `compact` is excluded
# for the same reason #341 excludes it from the delivery counter: it is
# provably not a new entry point into the session. `startup`, `resume`,
# `clear`, `fork`, an absent source and an unrecognised value are left
# triggering exactly as before — narrowing further would mean staging files
# wait indefinitely for a session that never does a bare `startup` again.
# #517: normalize before the glob -- REMEMBER_DIR arrives backslash-
# separated on msys/cygwin, and bash's glob only ever splits on '/', so
# without this the count silently undercounts to 0 there, gating the
# "N day(s) of memory to compress" message and the background
# consolidation trigger off for real.
