# lib-clock.sh — _remember_date, without a process where bash can do it (#227)
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Resolves "now" using REMEMBER_TZ when set, else system local time. This
#   lived in log.sh; it moved here so the one hook that needs nothing else from
#   log.sh — user-prompt-hook.sh — can have the time without the whole chain.
#
#   Two implementations, one output:
#
#     * bash's `printf '%(FMT)T'` builtin — no process at all. bash >= 4.2.
#     * `date "+FMT"` — one process, and the ONLY path on stock macOS, which
#       ships bash 3.2.57. Not a legacy fallback: it is what the plugin's own
#       author and the #204 reporter run.
#
#   Both hand the same format to the same libc strftime, so they agree byte for
#   byte — pinned by tests/test_prompt_hook_spawns.py, which runs both and
#   compares, rather than trusting the format string. Getting fast on a slow
#   platform must not cost the timestamp on a fast one: a builtin-only rewrite
#   prints a literal `%(%H:%M %Z)T` on every stock Mac.
#
# USAGE
#   source "${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}/lib-clock.sh"
#   NOW=$(_remember_date '+%H:%M %Z')
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   REMEMBER_TZ            Timezone override (set by log.sh from config.json).
#                          An empty value must NOT become `TZ="" date` — that is
#                          UTC on macOS/BSD, which is how a log file once got
#                          tomorrow's name after 20:00 local.
#   REMEMBER_NO_PRINTF_T=1 Force the `date` path. Exists so CI on bash 5 can
#                          still exercise the bash 3.2 implementation; a
#                          fallback only ever run on one platform is a fallback
#                          nobody tests.
#
# THE SEAM THIS REMOVED
#   A builtin is not on PATH, so putting a fake `date` in front of PATH — the
#   obvious way to test anything time-dependent in a shell pipeline, and how
#   tests/test_ndc_day_boundary.py fakes midnight — no longer intercepts
#   anything on bash >= 4.2. The fake is not refused, it is ignored, and the test
#   quietly asserts against the real clock: green on macOS bash 3.2, red
#   everywhere else. REMEMBER_NO_PRINTF_T=1 restores the seam, and the shared
#   test env builder (tests/test_save_session_gates.py::_make_env) sets it for
#   every shell test. A lint in tests/test_prompt_hook_spawns.py fails if a test
#   shims `date` without naming that variable.
#

# Formats the builtin is NOT trusted with, checked as a glob — no fork.
#
# `%-I` and friends are GNU *date* padding flags. GNU coreutils implements them
# in its own strftime copy, so `date '+%-I'` works on a box whose libc strftime
# would print the flag verbatim — and save-session.sh uses exactly that for the
# 12-hour clock. Neither is on a hot path. Send them to `date`, where they
# already worked.
#
# `%s` used to be refused here too, lumped in with the GNU-only padding flags
# above on the theory that it was "likewise a strftime extension" -- it is
# not: POSIX strftime has specified %s (seconds since the epoch) since
# POSIX.1-2008, bash's own `printf '%(FMT)T'` builtin calls straight through
# to the platform's strftime for exactly this format spec, and
# `tests/test_session_start_promo_spawn_budget_660.py` pins the builtin and
# `date +%s` byte-identical on this same gate (#666, part of #660) -- the
# same standard `test_the_builtin_and_date_timestamps_are_byte_identical`
# already holds every other format to. `post-tool-hook.sh:377/605` and
# `session-start-hook.sh` both feed a `_remember_date +%s` result straight
# into `$(( ))`, which is exactly why it matters that this is the real
# seconds-since-epoch integer and not a literal "%s" -- and why it was worth
# checking rather than assuming, instead of just deleting the glob term.

# _remember_date_into VARNAME [+FORMAT ...] (#511)
# Same answer as `_remember_date`, written into VARNAME directly instead of
# printed. `VAR=$(_remember_date ...)` forks a subshell for the command
# substitution itself EVEN on the builtin (no-`date`-process) path -- cheap on
# Linux, 50-300ms+ measured on Windows Git Bash per #511's report, and paid on
# every single prompt regardless of platform. `printf -v` writes to a named
# variable with no subshell at all, so the builtin/no-REMEMBER_TZ case -- the
# overwhelming common one on a warmed hook -- now forks nothing here, not even
# for the substitution itself. The REMEMBER_TZ and bash-3.2 cases still shell
# out to `date`, an external process either way, so a subshell there is not a
# new cost -- this only removes the fork that command substitution adds ON TOP
# of an already-forkless builtin call.
