# save-session.sh — Extract and summarize a Claude Code session into daily memory
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   The main extraction pipeline. Reads the current session's JSONL transcript,
#   extracts human/assistant exchanges, sends them to Haiku for summarization,
#   and appends the result to now.md. Periodically compresses now.md into a
#   dated today-YYYY-MM-DD.md file via NDC (Now-Day Compression).
#
# USAGE
#   save-session.sh <session-id>        # normal (called by post-tool hook)
#   save-session.sh --force             # bypass cooldown + min message threshold
#   save-session.sh <id> --force        # recover a specific missed session
#   save-session.sh --dry               # preview extraction, skip Haiku call
#
# ARGUMENTS
#   <session-id>   UUID of the session JSONL file (auto-detected if omitted)
#   --force        Bypass cooldown timer and minimum human message threshold
#   --dry          Preview mode — show extracted exchanges, do not call Haiku
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   REMEMBER_DEBUG            Set to "1"/"0" for verbose logging. Unset, the
#                             `debug` config option decides; unset there too,
#                             this script is verbose (its long-standing
#                             default) while the git-backup hook is quiet.
#   REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH  Trusted input for a manual run (#431). When set,
#                             pipeline.host.transcript_path() hands it to
#                             find_session() verbatim -- existence-checked
#                             only, no containment check -- the same as the
#                             hook-spawned path this script normally runs on.
#                             session-start-hook.sh and session-end-hook.sh
#                             export it freshly, from their own validated
#                             stdin payload, on every run; post-tool-hook.sh
#                             and user-prompt-hook.sh (which spawn this script
#                             with no transcript_path of their own to offer)
#                             clear it before doing anything else (#424/#430).
#                             This script does neither: run by hand, it
#                             inherits whatever your shell already holds,
#                             deliberately. Unset it yourself before a manual
#                             run if you do not want that.
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   python3, claude CLI (Haiku), git, date, mktemp
#   Sources: log.sh (logging, safe_eval, config)
#   Python: pipeline.shell (extract, build-prompt, parse-haiku, save-position,
#           build-ndc-prompt)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   Success (or skip due to cooldown/threshold/SKIP response)
#   1   Lock held, invalid session ID, python3 not found, Haiku error,
#       or file write error
#
# ARCHITECTURE
#   Shell handles locks (noclobber), cooldowns, file I/O, and background NDC.
#   Python (pipeline/) handles JSONL extraction, prompt building, and response
#   parsing. Data flows via temp files — never shell-interpolated.
#
#   Pipeline steps:
#     1. Extract exchanges from session JSONL
#     2. Get last memory entry (for dedup context)
#     3. Build summarization prompt
#     4. Call Haiku via `pipeline.shell call-haiku` (sandbox + parse in one)
#     5. Parse response (detect SKIP vs. content)
#     6. Append to now.md + save position
#     7. NDC compression (hourly, background subshell)

# --- Lock (mkdir acquisition, rename-based stale takeover — see lib-lock.sh) ---
# Two acquisition strategies, not one (#369). A PLAIN call (post-tool-hook.sh's
# background fork, or a bare `save-session.sh <id>`) still uses timeout 0: a
# save that loses the race skips rather than queues, because two saves of the
# same session back to back have nothing to add to each other and the next
# tool call brings another one along in seconds. That reasoning does not carry
# over to --force. session-end-hook.sh forks `save-session.sh --force` as the
# session's LAST chance to flush, moments after post-tool-hook.sh's own
# background save may have just taken the lock for the same span — timeout 0
# then loses a race it was never trying to win, and used to exit 0 having
# saved nothing, indistinguishable from a genuine no-op.
#
# So a FORCED call waits, bounded, instead of failing on contact: long enough
# to outlast an ordinary save (NDC's own commit-lock wait is 30s, reused here
# as the same order of magnitude — see NDC_COMMIT_LOCK_TIMEOUT above), short
# enough not to hang the session-end hook, which backgrounds this call
# specifically so a slow flush cannot block Claude Code's own hook timeout
# (see session-end-hook.sh). Env-overridable so a test can drive the timeout
# path without waiting out the real default, same shape as
# REMEMBER_NDC_COMMIT_LOCK_TIMEOUT above.
#
# This is a bounded RETRY, not a second writer: --force still waits for the
# SAME mutex, never bypasses it. Two concurrent writers to now.md was
# considered and rejected — that reintroduces the #142/#168 class of bug this
# lock exists to prevent, to buy back a race that a longer wait already
# closes in the overwhelming majority of cases.
#
# The failure that remains — the holder outlives even this wait — must not be
# silent (#369's actual complaint). It exits 1, distinct from the plain
# path's exit 0, and session-end-hook.sh already checks that exit code and
# calls report_error on nonzero: this makes that existing check see the

    #
    # What it costs, measured on bash 3.2.57 and 5.2.37: bash abandons the
    # ENTIRE if/then body and resumes after `fi`. So the `[ "$ELAPSED" -lt ... ]`
    # below is never reached, `exit 0` never runs, and this save skips its
    # cooldown -- one stderr line the only trace. Nothing dies: `set -e` is not
    # involved, and neither is `set -u` (which 50-git-backup.sh sets and this
    # file does not) -- $ELAPSED is inside the abandoned body, so no unbound
    # variable is ever referenced there either.
    #
    # Scope it honestly, and the honest scope is narrower than this comment used
    # to claim (#326). For a marker bash cannot PARSE, `date +%s >
    # "$COOLDOWN_MARKER"` sits below the `fi`, so it runs regardless and the
    # marker SELF-HEALS: one corruption, one skipped cooldown. That was written
    # as though it covered every corrupt marker. It does not. A marker that
    # parses and is merely OUT OF RANGE takes the `exit 0` below instead, which
    # is ABOVE that line — handled explicitly now, in the range arm. The
    # confident wrong scoping outlived the CHANGELOG correction at v0.17.0 by a
    # release, which is the whole reason #326 had to be reopened. The guard is
    # worth having
    # because unvalidated file content in an arithmetic evaluator is a sink in

    # never instead of it: 10# on an empty string is itself an error on bash 5.

# --- Step 3: Build prompt ---
# BRANCH RESOLUTION START -- identity slot for the "## HH:MM | <branch>" header.
# Order:
#   1. $REMEMBER_BRANCH wins when set. Empty string is treated as unset so an
#      accidental `export REMEMBER_BRANCH=` doesn't propagate.
#   2. $REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD, invoked as `$REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD "$SESSION_ID"`.
#      Sessions of one project share $PROJECT_DIR, so step 3 below resolves
#      to the SAME branch for every one of them -- concurrent sessions in a
#      single project need a slot that differs per writer, and $SESSION_ID is
#      the value already in scope that does (#481). What a session id should
#      map to is site-specific (a local registry of named sessions, a short
#      hash, ...), so this is a hook rather than a new built-in default.
#      A non-zero exit or empty stdout falls through to step 3 rather than
#      propagating a broken command's silence into the header -- but ONLY
#      when $REMEMBER_BRANCH_CMD failed to run at all is that silent: a
#      command that IS configured and DID fail logs a WARNING first, so a
#      typoed path or a resolver that starts failing later reads as a
#      reported fault rather than as "never configured" (the same reasoning
#      the ERROR logs a few steps above this one already apply to a torn
#      now.md read).
#   3. `git branch --show-current` in $PROJECT_DIR, for users running Claude
#      Code from a non-git directory (e.g. $HOME) this yields nothing.
#   4. The literal "unknown".
#
# $CMD_BRANCH becomes $BRANCH, which is substituted verbatim into the
# summarizer prompt (pipeline/prompts.py's {{BRANCH}}) with no bound of
# its own on embedded control characters (#501). $(...) only strips a
# TRAILING newline, so a resolver that prints more than one line -- or a
# lone carriage return with no line feed, which a naive terminal reads
# as "return to column 0 mid-line" the same way an embedded newline is
# -- would write arbitrary content at column 0 of the prompt. Bounded
# here, before BRANCH is ever set, by rejecting the result outright on
# either character -- same as a non-zero exit or empty stdout above:
# falls through to the git branch lookup, logged the same way, rather
# than silently truncating to the first line (a truncation a reader of
# the log could not tell apart from the resolver only ever having meant

# reader, and the reader that matters cannot take it: session-start-hook.sh
# sources resolve-paths.sh, detect-tools.sh, bootstrap-dirs.sh, log.sh and
# lib-env-cache.sh, never lib-lock.sh, so lock_acquire is not merely uncalled
# there — it is undefined in that process. Its memory-injection loop is a bare
# `cat "$MFILE"`, and between the two appends there is a whole fork+exec of
# `cat` during which now.md ends in a separator whose entry has not arrived.
# A session start landing there is handed a truncated final entry and has no
# way to know it.
#
# Not a reader lock. #227 measured that hook path at a p50 of 8.7s, #230 exists
# to cut its per-tool-call prefix, and #204 is a user reporting this plugin
# blocking their prompts. Putting session start behind a lock held for the whole
# of a save — including its summarize Haiku call — is a worse trade than the
# tear. The writer carries the atomicity; the reader stays lean.
#
# Not one `cat` of separator-plus-entry either. That closes the process gap and
# leaves the chunk boundaries inside a single write loop, which is a smaller
# window, not no window. A rename has no window at any entry size: the reader
# opens either the old inode or the new one, and both are whole. That is the
# pattern already used four times here — lib-env-cache.sh:170-175 ("Rename, so
# no reader ever parses a partial file"), post-tool-hook.sh:260-262, the NDC
# commit (#245), the consolidation staging tail (#249). This was the call site
# that had not adopted it.
#
# The cost is a full copy of now.md per save, on a path that has just spent
# seconds in a model call. now.md is compressed by NDC and is kilobytes; the
# copy is not measurable against the Haiku call it follows.
#
# A crash between mktemp and mv leaves a stray sibling. Inert — .remember's
# .gitignore is '*', doctor.sh globs `now.md` exactly, and the name deliberately
# does not end in .md so neither today-*.md nor session-start injection can see
# it — but it would accumulate forever, so sweep first. Safe: this block is the
# only thing that creates these, it runs under save.lock, and NDC's sweep uses a
# different glob (now.md.ndc-*).

# --- Housekeeping: reclaim aged autonomous logs (#487, #488, #498, #502) ---
#
# Runs unconditionally, independent of RUN_NDC/features.ndc_compression
# (#498): this directory's only retention used to live inside the
# `if [ "$RUN_NDC" = true ]` block above by accident of placement, so
# setting features.ndc_compression=false silently disabled ALL
# logs/autonomous/ housekeeping too, with autonomous_log_retention_days
# left configured and doing nothing -- and nothing told an operator the
# setting was inert. Moved out here so it always runs on an ordinary flush,
# regardless of whether NDC compression itself ran this round.
#
# An empty one is swept immediately -- an abandoned run's redirect target
# that never got a header written into it. That used to be this directory's
# ONLY retention (#483), and it stopped covering session-end-*.log the
# moment #483 seeded $_END_LOG with a header before its own subshell ever
# opens the file: every one of those is non-empty by construction now, so
# an empty-only sweep never reclaims that class again, and the
# accumulation is #487's own report of it.
#
# The age-keyed sweep below is the fix for that: over BOTH file classes
# (save-*.log and session-end-*.log share the "*.log" glob), rather than
# keyed to emptiness -- emptiness was always a proxy for staleness, and it
# is the proxy that produced #483 in the first place. A log this script
# itself just wrote (this run's own save-*.log, or the
# session-end-hook.sh-seeded header this same flush is appending into) has
# an mtime of now and is nowhere near the cutoff, so neither branch below
# can delete output a caller might still want to read.
#
# A portable stat-based loop, not `find -mtime "+N" -delete` /
# `find -empty -delete` (#502): `find` is the one command on this path with
# a real PATH-shadowing risk on Windows Git Bash (System32's find.exe
# takes none of the flags either sweep needs and would fail silently into
# the swallowed stderr the old `2>/dev/null` carried, degrading "reclaim"
# into a silent always-keep with nothing surfaced) -- and, independent of
# shadowing, `find`'s own day-rounding `-mtime` arithmetic is one more
# place for a platform-specific off-by-one to hide where nothing would
# report it. session-start-hook.sh already documents the identical
# PATH-shadowing risk for its own `-mmin` sweep and takes the same
# stat-based way around it; `stat` here uses the same
# GNU-first-then-BSD-fallback order already used there, at doctor.sh:257
# and at lib-lock.sh:183.

# windows-latest leg left both the backdated file AND this run's own fresh
# log in place -- no deletion at any age, default retention or configured,
# NDC on or off. resolve-paths.sh's own `_remember_normalize_win_path`
# rewrites CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to a fully backslash-separated Windows-native
# form on msys/cygwin (Claude Code hands it over as `/c/Users/...`, and
# #263/#448 convert that to `C:\Users\...` so the three shell slug sites
# and Python's `_session_dir` agree with Claude Code's own slugging) --
# and REMEMBER_DIR is lib-memory-dir.sh's legacy `"${proj}/${data_dir}"`,
# so on Windows it is backslash-separated end to end, same as PROJECT_DIR.
#
# Every ordinary file op downstream of that (mkdir -p, >>, stat, rm -f)
# still works with a backslash-laden path, because the MSYS runtime that
# implements those syscalls translates it -- which is exactly why the
# earlier mkdir, the header write and the mtime read in this same flush
# all succeed on that leg. bash's own glob does not get that translation:
# it recognises only '/' as a path-component boundary, on every platform
# including Windows Git Bash, because that is POSIX glob(3)'s own
# definition of a pathname, not a filesystem property -- so
# "${REMEMBER_DIR}/logs/autonomous"/*.log, with REMEMBER_DIR entirely
# backslashes, has no '/' anywhere before "logs", and bash looks for a
# single literal directory ENTRY named the whole backslash string, finds
# none, and the glob expands to nothing: the loop body never runs, for
# any file, at any age, which is exactly the "nothing was ever removed"
# shape both failing assertions and the NDC-disabled variant share.
#
# Forward-slashing only the directory argument fixes the glob without
# touching REMEMBER_DIR itself (every other consumer of that variable
# still gets the form the rest of the script -- and the Windows slug
# matching #263/#448 exist for -- expects). A no-op on POSIX, where this
# never contains a backslash to begin with; pinned portably in
# tests/test_autonomous_log_retention_487.py's own glob-mechanism test,
# since a real Windows-native REMEMBER_DIR cannot be constructed on a
# POSIX filesystem at all (POSIX mkdir/open treat backslash as an
# ordinary filename character rather than a separator, so the two
# platforms would stop disagreeing and the bug would not reproduce).
#
# Gated on $OSTYPE, not applied unconditionally (self-review finding):
# backslash is a perfectly ordinary, legal filename character on POSIX,
# and `_remember_normalize_win_path` above is ITSELF gated the same way,
# for the same reason -- it never rewrites CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR outside
# msys/cygwin, so REMEMBER_DIR only ever carries a backslash-as-separator
# on those two. An unconditional `${REMEMBER_DIR//\\//}` would silently
# mangle a real POSIX project directory whose name happens to contain a
# literal `\` (e.g. copied from somewhere that allowed it) into a
# different, generally nonexistent path -- turning a working retention
# sweep into a silently broken one for that one directory, on the
# platform this fix has no business touching at all.
