# agy-pre-invocation-hook.sh — Antigravity CLI (agy) PreInvocation adapter (#563)
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Antigravity's PreInvocation is this plugin's SessionStart-adjacent
#   mid-session bookkeeping point -- see the #563 issue body's own mapping
#   table (UserPromptSubmit -> PreInvocation). It fires per MODEL
#   INVOCATION, not per user prompt: a turn that makes several invocations
#   fires this several times. user-prompt-hook.sh already tolerates being
#   called more than its Claude Code name implies (Codex's own
#   UserPromptSubmit binding shares this script unchanged, #410), so no new
#   throttling was added here -- if the extra firings prove too frequent in
#   practice that is a follow-up, not something to guess at now.
#
#   user-prompt-hook.sh reads only `cwd` from its own stdin (everything else
#   it needs comes from cached environment or is deliberately cleared, see
#   its own "REMEMBER_TRANSCRIPT_PATH" section) -- so the rename this adapter
#   does is intentionally the smallest one in this port: `workspacePaths[0]`
#   (Antigravity) -> `cwd` (Claude Code shape), nothing else.
#
# STDIN
#   The PreInvocation JSON payload agy hands the hook, consumed here in full
#   and re-emitted (renamed, not reinterpreted) to user-prompt-hook.sh's own
#   stdin.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is exported here for the same reason
#   agy-session-start-hook.sh exports it -- see that script's own comment.
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   python3, user-prompt-hook.sh
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   Always -- user-prompt-hook.sh's own contract; see its own comment on
#       why a hook that runs on every invocation must never block one.

# #568: a malformed payload (bad JSON, or no python3 at all) used to
# normalise to the exact same {} this delegate call already sends for a
# genuinely empty payload, with no receipt distinguishing "there was
# nothing to say" from "the payload could not even be read". Settled by
# #568 itself: a log line on this arm is safe -- agy parses these hooks'
# STDOUT as protojson, but the delegate's own stdout is discarded a few
# lines down regardless, so stderr is free to use.
# mktemp's own failure (unwritable/full TMPDIR) must not abort this script
# under `set -e` -- self-review caught an earlier draft that called mktemp
# unguarded here, which turned a broken TMPDIR into an interpreter-level
# abort instead of this hook's own documented "0 Always" exit contract.
# `_PARSE_ERR_FILE` (empty on mktemp failure) and `_PARSE_ERR_TARGET`
# (falls back to /dev/null) are kept as two separate variables so the
# `rm -f` below can never be handed `/dev/null` itself.
