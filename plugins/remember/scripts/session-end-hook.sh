# session-end-hook.sh — SessionEnd hook for the Remember plugin
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Fires when a Claude Code session ends. Flushes whatever has not yet been
#   saved to now.md, ignoring both the cooldown (cooldowns.save_seconds) and
#   the min-human-message gate that PostToolUse's routine saves respect
#   (#345). Those gates exist to throttle a LIVE session; this hook runs once,
#   at the point where there is no next tool call and no next cooldown window
#   to catch up on the missed span. A session that ends in conversation rather
#   than tool calls — a design discussion, a review, a decision — is exactly
#   what PostToolUse's delta/cooldown gates can leave unsaved, because nothing
#   after the last save cleared them.
#
#   Does NOT write a handoff note. `/remember` (skills/remember/SKILL.md)
#   composes remember.md from the model's own first-person recollection of
#   the session — "What's done, what's not", "what to pick up", written in
#   "I". There is no model turn running at SessionEnd for this hook to
#   narrate from; it is a bash script with the raw transcript, not the agent
#   that lived the session. A generated placeholder ("session ended, see
#   now.md") would silently overwrite a real handoff a user wrote earlier in
#   the same session with something that carries no forward-looking content
#   at all — worse than leaving the existing file alone, and adjacent to
#   #341's stale-banner problem rather than a fix for it. now.md (this hook's
#   actual output) is what a next session's recovery block and consolidation
#   pipeline read; a real, older remember.md is left untouched.
#
# STDIN
#   The SessionEnd payload. `session_id` and `reason` are read with the same
#   bounded, non-blocking approach post-tool-hook.sh uses for `session_id`:
#   never from a tty, and time-bounded (`read -t 1`) so a pipe held open with
#   nothing in it costs at most a second rather than hanging session teardown.
#   Read once, by the process Claude Code invoked; the detached child gets
#   the same bytes through REMEMBER_SESSION_END_PAYLOAD and never touches
#   stdin (it has /dev/null there).
#
#   `reason` is documented (Claude Code hooks reference, checked 2026-08) as
#   one of clear/resume/logout/prompt_input_exit/other, but is treated here as
#   an opaque, unvalidated token — logged for diagnostics, never branched on.
#   No reason this hook has actually observed in the wild disqualifies a
#   flush: the whole point is that this is the last chance, not a routine
#   tick, so every reason gets the same unconditional attempt.
#
#   Whether SessionEnd fires at all on a crash, a killed terminal, or a
#   process hitting the usage cap is NOT established by that same reference —
#   it documents the graceful paths (clear, logout, prompt_input_exit,
#   resume) and is silent on the abrupt ones. This hook cannot make it fire
#   where Claude Code itself would not invoke it; `features.recovery` softens
#   exactly that gap from the next session's start and is deliberately left
#   in place rather than treated as superseded by this hook (#345).
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT   Plugin install directory (set by Claude Code)
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR   Project root (default: .)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0   Always, and immediately — since #647 this process does nothing but
#       read stdin and re-launch itself detached (see the detach section
#       below), so its own exit waits on neither the path/tool preamble nor
#       save-session.sh. Claude Code's SessionEnd budget is 1.5s shared
#       across every hook on the event, and the preamble alone was measured
#       past that on a slow Windows machine (#560). A failed flush is reported loudly
#       once that subshell finishes (report_error(), which reaches both the
#       daily log and hook-errors.log — surfaced by /remember:doctor) rather
#       than swallowed silently: the other hooks in this plugin can afford
#       silence on failure because there is always a next tool call or a
#       next session to retry from. This one is the last chance a session
#       gets, which is also why it is the one hook here NOT allowed to lose
#       its own failure to the same 60s kill it is trying to survive.
#
# ============================================================================

# --- Where this script lives ---
# Same parameter-expansion resolution as post-tool-hook.sh / user-prompt-hook.sh
# (#230) rather than three `dirname` forks. A path with no slash in it leaves
# the filename behind, not a directory; `dirname` answered "." and this must
# too.

# --- Nested summarizer: there is no project here (#204) ---
# Same guard every hook in this plugin carries: this plugin can re-enter its
# own hooks from a nested/headless session, and scaffolding a memory
# directory under the summarizer's own temp dir is a bug regardless of which
# hook does it.
[ -n "${REMEMBER_NESTED_SUMMARIZER:-}" ] && exit 0

# --- Read stdin: session_id and reason ---
# Cleared, not merely left alone (#266) — see post-tool-hook.sh's identical
# comment. This plugin can re-enter its own hooks from a nested session, and
# both names are exported at points elsewhere in this plugin's hooks, so a
# stale value here would be the plausible-and-wrong answer rather than the
# honest absent one.

# ── Detach BEFORE the preamble, not after it (#647, #560) ─────────────────
# Claude Code gives SessionEnd a 1.5-second budget shared across every hook
# registered for the event. #560 measured everything this script used to do
# synchronously before forking its flush -- lib-clock.sh, resolve-paths.sh,
# detect-tools.sh's python/jq probing, bootstrap-dirs.sh, log.sh -- at ~3.4s
# on a slow Windows/Git-Bash machine, so the hook was cancelled before the
# flush existed, on every exit. #561 declared `"timeout": 10` in
# hooks/hooks.json to raise that ceiling. Claude Code's own reference says
# "Timeouts set on plugin-provided hooks don't raise the budget", and
# hooks.json ships inside a plugin: on the install route both reporters are
# on, that declaration may do nothing at all, and the #647 reporter (0.29.1,
# claude-plugins-official) still sees `Hook cancelled` on every exit.
#
# So this process now does the least it can: read stdin, hand the ENTIRE
# job -- preamble, trace seed, flush -- to a detached copy of itself, exit.
# Tens of milliseconds, on any machine, on any install route, under any
# budget. The child is this same script re-entered with
# REMEMBER_SESSION_END_DETACHED set and the payload carried in an env var
# (never re-read from a stdin it no longer has). Both are unset again the
# moment the child has consumed them, so nothing this hook spawns in turn
# sees either.
#
# fd hygiene (#646): nothing above this line opens a descriptor beyond
# 0/1/2, so redirecting those three is the whole set. If that ever changes,
# close the extra ones here too -- an inherited dup of the client's pipe
# keeps the client waiting for the child, hook exit notwithstanding.
#
# REMEMBER_SESSION_END_FOREGROUND=1 (opt-in, unset in production) runs the
# old inline shape: no detach, stderr reaching the caller. The one thing
# the detached path cannot do is report a store that could never be
# created (#372) -- that warning went to this hook's own stderr because
# there is no hook-errors.log to write to when the directory that would
# hold it is what failed, and a detached child has no stderr the caller
# can see. That report survives only in foreground mode; the trade is
# stated in docs/hooks.md rather than left for someone to discover.

# log.sh returns early on a store it cannot create a logs/ dir in — before it

# above is not the same question as those existing (#361, #372). Same guard
# post-tool-hook.sh and user-prompt-hook.sh already carry, for the same
# reason: `declare -F`, NOT `type` or `command -v` — on macOS /usr/bin/log is
# Apple's unified-logging CLI, so `type log` is true whether or not a shell
# function was ever defined, the guard would pass, and the stub below would
# never be installed: `log "hook" "..."` two lines down would instead exec
# that binary, dump its own usage text to stderr, and exit 64 from a hook
# documented "EXIT CODES: 0 Always". Measured on bash 3.2.57 (macOS).
#
# Unlike the no-op stubs the hot paths install, these two still have to

# swallowed silently", and the `report_error` call further down (guarding
# the `[ ! -d "$REMEMBER_DIR" ]` branch) is reachable only when this source

# "Falls back to stderr if log file is unwritable" — this reproduces exactly
# that fallback, because it is the same fallback for the same reason:
# $REMEMBER_DIR/logs is what could not be created. hook-errors.log and the
# notices channel user-prompt-hook.sh reads (#200, #253) are both files under
# that same directory, so neither is reachable here; stderr is the only
# channel left, and bootstrap-dirs.sh only redirects it into hook-errors.log
# once that directory exists (bootstrap-dirs.sh:230-231) — on this path it is
# still going wherever Claude Code sends an unredirected hook's stderr,

# ── The on-disk trace that this hook fired, written FIRST (#647) ──────────
# Moved up here, ahead of the $REMEMBER_DIR and $SAVE_SCRIPT checks and
# ahead of the flush itself, from the bottom of the file where it used to
# sit immediately before the backgrounded subshell.
#
# Every exit path below this line -- a store that could not be created, a
# missing save-session.sh on a half-finished install -- used to leave the
# store in exactly the state an unregistered hook leaves it in: no
# session-end-*.log at all. That is the only evidence scripts/doctor.sh
# has, so it reported "SessionEnd has never fired for this project" and
# blamed hook registration, which was correct about the file and wrong
# about the cause. The #647 reporter went and audited a registration that
# was fine.
#
# This is as early as the trace can go: it needs $REMEMBER_DIR, which
# resolve-paths.sh and bootstrap-dirs.sh above are what establish, and
# report_error(), which the log.sh source above is what defines. Nothing
# between there and here can fail without being reported.
#
# On its own this move could not rescue a hook cancelled DURING that
# preamble -- #560 measured the preamble at ~3.4s on a slow Windows/Git-
# Bash machine against SessionEnd's 1.5s shared budget, and everything
# this seed depends on is inside it. That is why the detach at the top of
# this file now happens before the preamble rather than after it: by the
# time this line runs, the process running it is the detached child, on
# no budget at all. The two changes are one fix -- the detach makes this
# line reachable on that machine, and this line is what makes the result
# visible to /remember:doctor.
# Checked and reported (#503): this mkdir is best-effort defensive
# re-creation on top of bootstrap-dirs.sh's own earlier attempt, and a
# failure here means the seed write two lines down cannot land either --
# leaving $_END_LOG absent, which an ordinary housekeeping sweep cannot
# then be blamed for reclaiming (there is nothing to reclaim), and which
# scripts/doctor.sh's own SessionEnd-liveness check then misreports as
# "SessionEnd has never fired for this project" -- a hook-registration
# problem that does not exist. Reported the same way save-session.sh:428
# reports its own fall-through, so a read-only store or a full disk shows
# up as a fault rather than as silence.

# `$$` (this hook process's own PID) suffixes the second-granularity
# timestamp so two SessionEnd hooks for the same project, ending inside the
# same wall-clock second, no longer resolve to the same path (#488). That
# collision was not contrived -- scripts/doctor.sh's own SessionEnd-liveness
# comments already treat two concurrently open windows on one project as an
# ordinary case, and PR #486 only made the collision harmless (both hooks
# append rather than truncate) rather than absent: two flushes still
# interleaved into one file, with no way for a reader to tell whose lines
# were whose. `$$` is unique per invocation of THIS script -- it is not the
# backgrounded subshell's own PID, which is assigned only after this line
# runs -- so it is available before the header below is ever written, and
# distinct siblings still get distinct files. scripts/doctor.sh's own
# `session-end-*.log` glob (#370's SessionEnd-liveness check) needs no
# change for this: the `*` already matches whatever follows the timestamp,
# suffix included.

# save-session.sh's own housekeeping sweep (unconditional on every flush
# since #498, not tied to its NDC step) reclaims an empty file in this same
# directory unconditionally (scripts/save-session.sh), and on an ordinary
# successful flush NOTHING ever writes to this file: every
# save-session.sh log line goes to its own daily narrative file, not to
# stdout/stderr, so a `>`-truncated, still-empty $_END_LOG is exactly what
# that same sweep -- run from INSIDE the process writing into it -- matches
# and deletes. Two costs followed: the WARNING below named a path that was
# already gone by the time anyone read it, and a healthy flush left nothing
# on disk to confirm it ran at all. A non-empty file at open time is never
# `-empty`, so it survives its own run's housekeeping while a genuinely
# stale, still-empty log from an abandoned run is untouched by this and
# keeps getting swept exactly as before.
# `>>`, not `>`, is kept even now that `$$` makes an ordinary same-second
# collision unreachable: a PID can still be recycled across a long-lived
# store, and appending costs nothing when the file is otherwise guaranteed
# fresh. Belt, not the buckle.
# Checked and reported (#503): a failed seed write leaves $_END_LOG
# absent or empty exactly as if it had never been opened, so the very
# next housekeeping sweep reclaims it as an abandoned run's redirect
# target -- and #483's original bug (no on-disk trace that SessionEnd
# ever fired) is silently back for this session, with
# scripts/doctor.sh's own liveness check then misreporting it as a hook
# that never fired at all. Reported the same way save-session.sh:428

# --- Flush, unconditionally, in the BACKGROUND ---
# save-session.sh --force bypasses its own cooldown timer AND its

# gate: a session with nothing new since the last save advances the saved
# position without a Haiku call, so this hook costs nothing extra when there
# is genuinely nothing to flush.
#
# Backgrounded, the same way post-tool-hook.sh forks its own call — NOT run
# and waited on in the foreground, which an earlier version of this hook did.
# Claude Code kills a hook process after `hooks.dispatch_timeout_seconds`'
# sibling budget for the events it waits on: this repo's own README documents
# "Claude Code kills a hook at 60s of its own accord" for exactly this
# reason. save-session.sh's own Haiku call already asks for up to 120s and
# NDC compression up to 180s (scripts/save-session.sh) — both past 60s on
# the sessions this hook exists to rescue, which are the long, content-heavy
# ones. A foreground
# wait risks losing the ENTIRE flush to Claude Code's own kill with no trace
# at all; a backgrounded one gets to keep running after this hook returns,
# the same way `hooks.d/after_save/50-git-backup.sh`'s own git push does
# ("a listener blocked in a foreground child leaks that child when the
# script is killed" — the shape this rewrite avoids). The trade is explicit:
# this hook can no longer report a flush failure to the SAME invocation of
# `/remember:doctor` that ran a second later, only to hook-errors.log once
# the background flush itself finishes — which is what the subshell below
# does.
#
# tmp/save-session.pid is the SAME marker post-tool-hook.sh's own
# background fork writes (scripts/post-tool-hook.sh), not a second one: both
# are "a save-session.sh is in flight" and nothing downstream needs to tell
# them apart.
# REMEMBER_TEST_COMPLETION_MARKER (opt-in, unset in production): CI
# iteration on #487 (PR #499) found the test harness's own PID-liveness
# wait (tasklist, on Windows) does not reliably observe this backgrounded
# flush finish on a real windows-latest runner -- $OSTYPE there reports
# "cygwin", and its PID does not appear to line up with what `tasklist`
# can find, so a test polling PID liveness alone gives up long before the
# real flush -- which does complete -- is done, and asserts against a
# still-running one. Rather than trust PID liveness at all, a caller that
# sets this var gets an explicit, unambiguous completion line appended to
# a file it names -- at zero cost to every real session, where the var is
# never set and this whole block is a no-op.
#
# Unlike the $_END_LOG seed write just above, a failed marker write here
# is NOT routed through report_error() (self-review finding, PR #499):
# report_error writes to hook-errors.log, a real, user-facing file every
# production session's own tests assert the CONTENTS of (see
# TestSeedWriteFailureIsReported's own "WARNING" checks), and this whole
# block is test-only opt-in scaffolding that must never add a line there
# a real session could see. A failed marker write still is not silent:
# bash reports a redirection failure it cannot honor to whatever this
# block's own enclosing stderr already is, which for the first `printf`
# below is this hook's own stderr (captured by the test harness as
