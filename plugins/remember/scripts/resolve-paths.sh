# resolve-paths.sh — Single source of truth for pipeline path resolution
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Resolves PROJECT_DIR (the user's project root) and PIPELINE_DIR (the
#   plugin's install location) from environment variables set by Claude Code.
#   All pipeline scripts source this file instead of computing paths inline.
#
#   Supports three install layouts:
#     1. Local:       $PROJECT/.claude/remember/scripts/resolve-paths.sh
#     2. Marketplace: ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/remember/*/scripts/resolve-paths.sh
#     3. Symlinked:   Any of the above with symlinks in the chain
#
# USAGE
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/resolve-paths.sh" || exit <caller-appropriate-code>
#   # Now PROJECT_DIR and PIPELINE_DIR are set and validated
#
#   This file is ALWAYS sourced, never executed directly. On failure it is
#   LOUD BY DEFAULT: it prints FATAL and `exit 1`s the caller, because a caller
#   that continues with unresolved paths writes memory to the wrong place —
#   worse than a crash.
#
#   A caller that must never terminate its host process opts out by setting
#   REMEMBER_PATHS_SOFT_FAIL=1 before sourcing; failure then `return 1`s and the
#   caller decides. Only the three Claude Code hooks do this — they are
#   documented "EXIT CODES: 0 Always" (a bare `exit` inside a sourced file kills
#   the whole hook process, which crashes the nested Haiku session that runs
#   with no resolvable project root). They pair it with `|| exit 0`.
#
#   The default is loud on purpose: a future caller that forgets to check the
#   status still fails safely instead of silently continuing with empty paths.
#
# ENVIRONMENT (inputs)
#   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR    Project root (set by Claude Code hooks)
#   REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD     Fallback project root (#411), consulted when
#                         CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is unset -- confirmed still true
#                         of Codex (live-observed, #463) but no longer of
#                         Gemini CLI, whose own bundled docs say it sets
#                         CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR as a compatibility alias (#456,
#                         unverified live -- #532). This fallback stays
#                         correct and needed regardless: it exists for ANY
#                         host that leaves CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR unset, Codex
#                         included, not only for Gemini. Exported by
#                         session-start-hook.sh / session-end-hook.sh from the
#                         SessionStart/SessionEnd stdin payload's `cwd` field;
#                         not read from stdin here (see the caller comments).
#   PLUGIN_ROOT           Plugin install directory, vendor-neutral name (#407).
#                         Read before CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, which is honoured
#                         when PLUGIN_ROOT is absent -- see pipeline/host.py.
#   CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT    Plugin install directory (set by Claude Code hooks;
#                         also set by Codex as a compatibility alias)
#
# ENVIRONMENT (outputs)
#   PROJECT_DIR           Resolved project root (validated to exist)
#   PIPELINE_DIR          Resolved plugin root (validated to exist)
#
# ENVIRONMENT (opt-in)
#   REMEMBER_PATHS_SOFT_FAIL=1   Signal failure with `return 1` instead of
#                                exiting the caller. Set by the hook scripts.
#   REMEMBER_NESTED_SUMMARIZER   Set by pipeline/haiku.py on the nested
#                                `claude -p` it spawns. There is no project
#                                here — resolve nothing and stop.
#
# RETURN CODES
#   1   Path resolution failed, and the caller opted into soft failure.
#       Without the opt-in, resolution failure exits the caller with 1.

# --- Nested summarizer: there is no project here (#204) ---
# The Haiku call in pipeline/haiku.py runs `claude -p` with cwd=gettempdir().
# Claude Code loads plugins in that child and derives its CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
# from that cwd, so every hook this plugin registers fires inside the
# summarizer with the temp dir as its "project" — scaffolding a memory
# directory under the temp dir's slug and injecting session-start output into
# the summarizer's own context.
#
# The guard belongs here rather than in any one hook: SessionStart,
# UserPromptSubmit and PostToolUse are all registered, all source this file,
# and each one alone is enough to create the directory. This is the only place
# that covers all three, and the only place a fourth hook would inherit it.

# --- Restrict file creation permissions ---
# Prevent log files, memory files, and temp files from being world/group readable.
# On multi-user machines (shared dev box, CI runner, jumphost) the default umask
# (022) creates files as -rw-r--r--, leaking project paths, branch names, token
# counts, and memory contents to any local user.  Setting 077 here covers every
# downstream file created after this source: logs, .remember/ dirs, TMPDIR temps.

# --- Windows shell normalization (Git Bash / MSYS / Cygwin) ----------------
# Claude Code stores sessions under a Windows-native slug (e.g.
# "C--Users-dev-project") computed from the Win32 path "C:\Users\dev\project".
# But on Windows shells, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR arrives as a POSIX-style path
# ("/c/Users/dev/project") and our sed-based slug produces "-c-Users-dev-..."
# which never matches. The plugin's `ls $SESSION_DIR/*.jsonl` then returns
# nothing and the entire save pipeline silently no-ops.
#
# Convert /c/Users/... → C:\Users\... here so all downstream slug computations
# (3 shell sites + Python `_session_dir`) align with Claude Code's storage.
# On Linux/macOS bash $OSTYPE is "linux-gnu" or "darwin*"; the case below
# never matches and the input is echoed back untouched.
# All FOUR shapes, not just the POSIX one (#263). $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR does not
# always arrive in the same form on the same machine: the reporter's log carries
# `/c/Users/...` and `c:/Users/...` within a single day. Only the first matched,
# so only the first was normalised, and one directory produced two different
# slugs. NTFS is case-insensitive and hid that everywhere except git, whose
# pathspecs are not — `git add -- "$SLUG/"` matched nothing for twelve days and
# the backup reported an empty store.
#
# A path carrying no drive letter at all falls through untouched, which is what
# a genuine POSIX path under MSYS (/tmp, /usr) needs.
#
# A FUNCTION (#448), not a one-shot block run after PROJECT_DIR was already
# chosen. The old ordering tested REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD's `[ -d ]` in whatever
# spelling the caller's payload happened to carry, then normalized only the
# already-selected PROJECT_DIR afterwards -- so a Windows-native cwd
# (backslash separators, or a bare drive letter) was tested in the form the
# shell cannot resolve and the branch was skipped before the code that would
# have fixed the spelling ever ran. On a host with no CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
# (Codex, Gemini CLI) that meant every hook silently fell through to the loud
# failure via its own `|| exit 0`.
#
# The fix normalizes every candidate BEFORE it is tested, uniformly:
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR was never `-d`-tested before selection either (only
# trusted, then validated once at the very end below), so giving it the same
# normalize-then-trust treatment here is not a new exposure. REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD
# keeps its own existence test before selection -- now against the normalized
# form -- so a value that still doesn't resolve to a real directory falls
# through to the next candidate (the local-install derivation, or the loud
# failure) instead of being adopted and hard-failing later with a less
# specific message. Normalizing is pure string reshaping (drive letter case,
# separator direction) with no filesystem access of its own, so applying it to
# an unvalidated candidate before the existence test adds no new trust in a
# hostile REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD (#417, #424) -- the value still has to name a real
# directory to be selected, exactly as before.
#
# The drive-form regex lives in a variable: a bracket expression containing a
# backslash is not portable to write inline on the right of `=~`.

# --- Portable-glob helper (#517) -------------------------------------------
#
# Bash's own filename glob (`*`/`?`/`[...]`) and its parameter-expansion
# pattern matching (`%`/`##`/a `[[ == ]]` glob) both recognise ONLY '/' as a
# path-component separator -- POSIX glob(3)'s own definition of a pathname,
# not a filesystem property -- so on msys/cygwin, where REMEMBER_DIR (and
# PROJECT_DIR, via _remember_normalize_win_path above) arrive backslash-
# separated, every such operation against them silently matches nothing.
# #487 (PR #499) fixed this once, inline, for scripts/save-session.sh's own
# retention sweep; this is the same fix extracted so every later call site
# (#517) reuses one mechanism instead of re-deriving the $OSTYPE gate.
#
# Gated on $OSTYPE, not applied unconditionally, for the same reason
# _remember_normalize_win_path above is: a literal backslash is an ordinary,
# legal filename character on POSIX, and _remember_normalize_win_path (the
# thing that puts backslashes into these variables in the first place) is
# itself gated the identical way -- so a POSIX path never carries a
# separator-shaped backslash to begin with, and unconditionally rewriting
# one would mangle a real POSIX directory whose name happens to contain a
# literal `\` into a different, generally nonexistent path.
#
# Deliberately NOT `unset -f`'d below the way _remember_normalize_win_path
# is: every caller of this file that needs to glob or pattern-match against
# REMEMBER_DIR/PROJECT_DIR sources it AFTER this file runs, so the function
# has to still be callable then, unlike the normalize helper above, which is
# only ever used inline, above, within this same file.

# _remember_forward_slash_into VARNAME VALUE
# Same answer as _remember_forward_slash, written into VARNAME with

# of #660). `_remember_forward_slash` itself already forks nothing (`case` and
# a parameter expansion, no external process) -- the fork this removes is the
# one `$( )` was adding purely to capture that already-forkless function's
# stdout, the same class `_remember_date_into` (lib-clock.sh, #511) and
# config_into (log.sh, #665) remove for their own callers.

# --- Resolve PROJECT_DIR (the user's project root) ---
#
# Priority:
#   1. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR (set by Claude Code — always correct, and the more
#      specific signal on the host that sets it, so it is tried first and a
#      disagreeing stdin cwd never overrides it)
#   2. REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD (#411, #444) — the host's own hook-event payload's
#      `cwd` field, exported by the hook that read this file, from its own
#      stdin -- every hook this plugin registers now offers one (session-start
#      and session-end since #411; user-prompt and post-tool since #444).
#      Both Codex and Gemini CLI put `cwd` on that payload. Codex still
#      documents no CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR variable at all (live-confirmed,
#      #463), so this fallback is still what makes resolution possible on
#      Codex. Gemini CLI's own bundled docs now claim it DOES set
#      CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, as a compatibility alias (#456) -- unverified
#      live, #532 -- in which case priority 1 above wins for Gemini and this
#      fallback is simply never reached on that host; it stays correct and
#      needed for Codex and any other host that genuinely leaves
#      CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR unset. Not every
#      caller of this file is a hook with stdin to read -- doctor.sh and a
#      bare `source` from a shell have none -- so an unset or unusable value
#      here is silently skipped, same as an unset CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR above.
#      Normalized (#448) before the existence test immediately below, so a
#      Windows-native spelling is tested in the form the shell can resolve.
#
#      ASSUMPTION (#417): this file only SOURCES the variable, it never sets
#      it, so its correctness here depends on every caller either exporting a
#      freshly-validated value from its own stdin payload (every hook that
#      reaches this file does, as of #444, each rejecting embedded newlines)
#      or clearing it before sourcing this file when it has none to offer
#      (every non-hook caller, and any hook on a run where stdin carried no
#      usable `cwd` -- the `unset` at the top of each hook's file runs first,
#      before its own stdin read, for exactly that reason).
#      The assumption this whole chain rests on is that no supported host
#      reuses one process environment across separate hook invocations within
#      a project-agnostic dispatcher; on Claude Code CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR always
#      wins first and this arm never runs. If that assumption is ever wrong,
#      a value exported by one session's SessionStart could be inherited by a
#      later PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit invocation from a DIFFERENT project
#      that reused the same environment -- reachability was not established
#      either way when this comment was written; see #417.
