# lib-env-cache.sh — replay a completed path resolution instead of redoing it
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   `user-prompt-hook.sh` needs exactly two facts to print its line: where the
#   memory store is (REMEMBER_DIR, for the #200 capture-gap notice) and which
#   timezone to print (REMEMBER_TZ, from config.json). Deriving those runs
#   resolve-paths.sh → bootstrap-dirs.sh → log.sh: `git rev-parse`, a slug, a
#   three-layer config merge, ~19 processes measured on macOS and 27 on the
#   Windows/QEMU box in #227, where it cost a p50 of 8.7s on every prompt.
#
#   Neither fact can change while the config files that produce them do not. So
#   the hook that already paid for the answer writes it down, and the next one
#   reads it — no second resolver, and that distinction is the whole design.
#   #158 is the scar: a hook that re-derived REMEMBER_DIR its own way resolved a
#   DIFFERENT store than every other, which is split-brain memory rather than a
#   clean failure. This file never computes anything. It replays what
#   lib-memory-dir.sh and log.sh produced, or it declines and the caller runs
#   the real chain.
#
#   Every check below is a bash builtin — `[ -f ]`, `[ -O ]`, `[ -nt ]`,
#   parameter expansion, `read`. A validation step that forked would spend the
#   savings it exists to protect. The one exception (#504) is
#   `_remember_env_cache_normalize_into`'s Windows drive-letter uppercasing,
#   which forks `tr` -- but only on `OSTYPE=msys|cygwin`, and only once a
#   drive-letter pattern has actually matched, the same carve-out
#   resolve-paths.sh's own copy of this logic already makes. Everywhere else,
#   including that same function's own substitution site, `printf -v` is used
#   specifically so the key computation itself never forks a subshell.
#
# USAGE
#   source "$_HOOK_DIR/lib-env-cache.sh"
#   if _remember_env_cache_load; then
#       : # REMEMBER_DIR / REMEMBER_TZ / PROJECT_DIR / PIPELINE_DIR are set
#   else
#       source resolve-paths.sh; source bootstrap-dirs.sh; source log.sh
#       _remember_env_cache_publish
#   fi
#
# INVALIDATION
#   The cache is refused unless it is newer than all three config layers, and
#   unless CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR / CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT / HOME are the same values it
#   was written for. Editing config.json therefore takes effect on the next
#   prompt, exactly as it does today when every hook re-reads it. `-nt` against
#   a file that does not exist is true, which is the right answer: a config
#   layer that is still absent cannot have changed. Creating one makes it newer
#   than the cache, so the cache loses.
#
#   Not covered: a project that becomes (or stops being) a linked git worktree
#   while a cache is live, which would move REMEMBER_DIR. SessionStart
#   republishes unconditionally, so the window is one session.
#
# ENVIRONMENT
#   REMEMBER_ENV_CACHE=0   Disable entirely — every hook resolves from scratch.
#
# SECURITY
#   The file lives in the system temp dir, which is world-writable on Linux, and
#   it names a directory this plugin then writes memory into. It is therefore
#   read only when it is a regular file, not a symlink, and owned by the current
#   user; every line must match one known `KEY=value`, and one that does not
#   rejects the whole file rather than the line. Written 0600 via a private temp
#   file and renamed, so a reader never sees a half-written resolution.

_REMEMBER_LIB_ENV_CACHE_LOADED=1

# Sets _REMEMBER_ENV_CACHE_FILE and _REMEMBER_ENV_CACHE_KEY. Returns 1 when
# there is no project to key on.
#
# Keyed on the RAW CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR when it is set, falling back to
# REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD (#469): Codex sets neither CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR nor any
# variable this cache could key on before resolve-paths.sh runs (live-
# confirmed, #463); Gemini CLI's own bundled docs now say it DOES set
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR as a compatibility alias (#456, unverified live --
# #532), so on Gemini this cache is expected to key on that directly and
# never need the fallback at all. That absence was the entire premise of
# #407/#411/#444 for Codex -- the same hosts #411/#444 gave every hook a
# REMEMBER_HOOK_CWD fallback for -- and the fallback stays correct and
# needed for Codex and any other host that genuinely leaves
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR unset. Without this,
# resolve-paths.sh:270 still exports the RESOLVED CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR before
# _remember_env_cache_publish runs, so a cache file is written every time and
# never found by _remember_env_cache_load, which runs in a fresh process
# before that export exists. The per-process pin inside the function below is
# what keeps the key stable across a call that runs before resolve-paths.sh's
# normalisation and one that runs after, WITHIN one process -- but #504 found
# that pin is not enough on its own: user-prompt-hook.sh's fast path calls
# this BEFORE resolve-paths.sh has run, in a FRESH process, so it pins the RAW
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR the host set (unnormalised on Windows/Git-Bash --
# forward-slash or POSIX drive form); session-start-hook.sh's publish call
# runs AFTER resolve-paths.sh, in ITS OWN process, and pins the NORMALISED
# form resolve-paths.sh re-exported. Two different processes, two different
# strings for the same project, two different cache files -- the fast path
# can never hit what the slow path wrote. _remember_env_cache_normalize_into
# below closes that: same normalisation resolve-paths.sh's own
# _remember_normalize_win_path applies, scoped to the same `case "$OSTYPE" in
# msys|cygwin)` guard, so its BODY is a genuine no-op (no `tr` fork, no
# regex work) on every platform except the one where raw and resolved can
# actually disagree. Written into a named variable via `printf -v`, not
# printed for a caller to capture with `$( )` -- self-review on this same
# change (#511/#504, reviewed together) caught that `$(...)` forks a
# subshell for the SUBSTITUTION ITSELF regardless of what the function body
# does, which would have paid exactly the per-fork cost #511 exists to
# remove, on the fast path, on every single invocation, unconditionally on
# every platform -- not scoped to msys/cygwin the way the function body is.
# `_remember_normalize_win_path` in resolve-paths.sh keeps the older
# print-and-capture shape because that file's own callers are cold-path
# (once per hook invocation, after resolve-paths.sh has already forked far
# more than this); lib-env-cache.sh's copy exists specifically because this
# one runs on the hot path, so it gets the `_into` treatment from the start.
