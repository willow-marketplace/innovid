# lib-memory-context.sh — render the injected MEMORY section, and cache it
# across SessionStart runs (#668, part of #660)
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   session-start-hook.sh used to read, size, head and concatenate six memory
#   files plus the rotated-slice listing on EVERY single session start, even
#   though the bytes only change when a memory file changes -- i.e. after a
#   save or a consolidation, both of which already run in a detached
#   background phase (nohup ... & disown) before the next session starts.
#
#   This file is the single source of truth for that render, used by:
#     - session-start-hook.sh, on the foreground path: a cache hit skips the
#       render entirely (one `cat`); a miss renders live, same as before #668,
#       and additionally leaves a fresh cache behind for the next start.
#     - save-session.sh / run-consolidation.sh, at the very end of their own
#       body: both already run fully detached (see the `nohup ... & disown`
#       call sites in session-start-hook.sh and agy-stop-hook.sh), so a call
#       placed at their tail costs the interactive session nothing -- the
#       parent hook has already exited by the time either script reaches it.
#
#   Kept in one function rather than two copies for the same reason #158
#   documents for session_dir_slug: a second, independently-maintained render
#   is how the cache and the live path silently drift apart.
#
# CACHE VALIDATION
#   `$REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/start-context.cache` (raw bytes to inject) plus
#   `$REMEMBER_DIR/tmp/start-context.manifest` (one `SRC=<path>` line per
#   input the render depends on: the six memory files, REMEMBER_DIR itself --
#   so a rotated slice appearing or disappearing invalidates the cache even if
#   whatever created it forgot to republish -- and the three config layers,
#   since MEMORY_INJECT_MAX_BYTES is read from config()).
#
#   A hit requires the cache to be STRICTLY NEWER (`-nt`) than every manifest
#   entry that exists. Not `-ge`: two mtimes that compare EQUAL are treated as
#   a miss, never a hit, because FAT/exFAT's 2s mtime granularity can make a
#   source edited a moment after the cache was written compare equal to it --
#   an ambiguous read must invalidate, not serve stale content. `-nt` already
#   has this property (bash's `-nt` is false on a tie), so no special-casing is
#   needed beyond using it consistently, the same convention lib-env-cache.sh
#   already established for this codebase. `-nt` against a manifest entry that
#   does not exist is true, which is correct: an absent memory file cannot have
#   changed.
#
#   Only the non-`compact` render is cached. At `source=compact` the injection
#   is a different, much smaller shape (identity only; everything else is
#   named, not shown) -- caching that too would need a second cache keyed on
#   SESSION_START_SOURCE, and `compact` is already the cheap branch (it skips
#   reading five of the six files), so there is little to save there and real
#   risk in conflating the two shapes under one cache key.
#
# SECURITY
#   Same convention as lib-env-cache.sh and the promo marker: the cache lives
#   under REMEMBER_DIR/tmp, is written 0600 via mktemp + rename (never a
#   truncating redirect to a predictable name), and is read only when it is a
#   regular file owned by the current user -- a symlink or another user's file
#   is never trusted, and the loader falls back to a live render instead.

# _remember_render_memory_section
# Prints the "=== MEMORY ===" block exactly as session-start-hook.sh printed
# it before #668 -- identical bytes, so a cache hit and a live render are
# indistinguishable to whatever reads the hook's stdout. Requires
# _remember_memory_paths to have already run, and `config()` (log.sh) to be
# available. Reads SESSION_START_SOURCE from the environment; unset/empty is
# treated as the non-compact (full) render, same as the original code.
# bash 3.2 (the documented floor -- lib-clock.sh's own header, lib-lock.sh's
# _lock_timing_key comment) has no associative arrays, so the per-file byte
# counts `_remember_render_memory_section` batches below live in a variable
# named after the sanitized path instead, exactly like lib-lock.sh's own
# `_lock_timing_key` does for the same reason. `declare -A` parses as a
# syntax error... no, it does not -- it is ACCEPTED and silently creates a
# plain, non-associative array on bash 3.2 (`declare: -A: invalid option` is
# non-fatal), so the very next `${arr[$key]}` lookup throws a fatal "syntax
# error: operand expected" instead, aborting the whole render with nothing
# injected and nothing visible beyond stderr (#662/#664 self-review finding).
# `printf -v` + indirect (`${!name}`) expansion is plain parameter expansion,
# no subshell, and has worked since bash 2.x -- confirmed directly against
# the real `/bin/bash` 3.2.57 this repo ships behind on stock macOS.
