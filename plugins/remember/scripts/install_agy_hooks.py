"""install_agy_hooks.py -- merge Remember's Antigravity (agy) hooks into the
shared ~/.gemini/config/hooks.json (#563).

Antigravity has no per-plugin hook manifest: a plugin's own bundled
hooks.json is copied into ~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>/, counted, and
never loaded (#553). The only paths `agy` actually loads hooks from are
`~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` (shared, every plugin on the machine) and the
untested workspace-local `<workspace>/.agents/hooks.json`. This script
writes the shared one.

It also has no working variable substitution inside that shared file: agy
sets no plugin-root or project-dir environment variable
(pipeline/host.py's ANTIGRAVITY host declares neither -- confirmed by
dumping a live hook process's own environment, #563), and the
${extensionPath} substitution Gemini CLI extensions get is documented as
extension-local only, which a shared, non-extension file is not. So every
command has to be a literal, already-resolved absolute path -- there is no
manifest this script could check into git and have work unmodified on
another machine, unlike hooks/hooks.codex.json or .gemini/hooks/hooks.json.
This script exists to build and merge that literal manifest at install
time instead.

The target is a file every plugin on the machine may already be using, so a
merge here touches only this plugin's own top-level hook name ("remember")
and leaves every other key alone -- see test_merge_preserves_other_top_level_hook_names_563.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/install_agy_hooks.py [--target PATH] [--dry-run]

    --target PATH   Defaults to ~/.gemini/config/hooks.json.
    --dry-run       Print the merged JSON; do not write anything.

        # agy's own executor first tokenizes the raw string with something
        # else (e.g. cmd.exe, which has no concept of single-quote
        # grouping), a path containing a space could still be split wrong
        # there, before bash ever sees it -- REASONED, not observed, same
        # as the rest of Windows agy support in this file (see the module
        # docstring and docs/install-antigravity.md's own caveat). What
        # this fix closes is bash's OWN parsing of the string once it gets
        # one: the embedded-quote and $(...) hazards, which are real and
        # reproducible with a real bash on every platform this repo tests.

        # literal double quote, and embedding that inside another pair of
        # double quotes breaks out exactly the same way the un-escaped
        # original did (the embedded `"` still closes the outer wrapper
        # early). Replacing the whole construction, rather than quoting only
        # the interpolated segment, is what actually closes the hole; a
