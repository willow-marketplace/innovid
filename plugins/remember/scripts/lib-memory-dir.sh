# lib-memory-dir.sh — Resolve REMEMBER_DIR and produce a merged REMEMBER_CONFIG
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Single source of truth for two closely coupled concerns:
#
#   1. REMEMBER_DIR — where memory data files live.
#      Normally "${PROJECT_DIR}/.remember" (legacy default).
#      When config.json carries a data_dir starting with "/" or "~", the path
#      is expanded and the {slug} placeholder is replaced with the
#      session_dir_slug of PROJECT_DIR, matching Claude Code's own naming for
#      ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/.
#
#   2. REMEMBER_CONFIG — the merged config.json that every caller reads via
#      config(). Built by deep-merging three layers (highest priority wins):
#        1. ${PIPELINE_DIR}/config.json          (plugin-bundled defaults)
#        2. ${HOME}/.remember/config.json         (user-global, survives updates)
#        3. ${REMEMBER_DIR}/config.json           (per-project override)
#
# USAGE
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/resolve-paths.sh"   # sets PROJECT_DIR, PIPELINE_DIR
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/detect-tools.sh"    # sets session_dir_slug
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/lib-memory-dir.sh"  # exports REMEMBER_DIR, REMEMBER_CONFIG
#
# REQUIRES
#   PROJECT_DIR    — set by resolve-paths.sh
#   PIPELINE_DIR   — set by resolve-paths.sh
#   session_dir_slug — sourced from lib-slug.sh (no longer needs detect-tools.sh)
#
# EXPORTS
#   REMEMBER_DIR         — absolute path to memory data directory
#   REMEMBER_STORE_ROOT  — the directory the per-project stores sit in, and empty
#                          unless data_dir is absolute AND carries {slug} (#297)
#   REMEMBER_CONFIG      — absolute path to merged config (tmp file)
#
# ============================================================================

# Guard against double-sourcing. Use default-expansion so set -u callers don't error.

# session_dir_slug, from the one file that defines it. This used to be a naive
# inline fallback declared at the point of use — the pre-#144 implementation,
# carrying every bug #156 fixed, and live for user-prompt-hook.sh, which reaches
# here without sourcing detect-tools.sh (#158). Sourcing detect-tools.sh instead
# is not an option: it exits 1 when it finds no Python, taking its caller down.

# _resolve_memory_project_dir <project_dir>
# Returns the directory memory should be keyed to. Normally this is PROJECT_DIR
# itself. When PROJECT_DIR is a *linked git worktree*, Claude Code has set
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR to the worktree path — but memory should live with the main
# checkout so it survives `git worktree remove` and is shared across worktrees
# of the same repo (issue #56). A linked worktree is detected via git's common
# dir differing from its git dir; the main checkout is the parent of the shared
# common dir.
#
# Fail-safe by design: it only redirects when it positively identifies a linked
# worktree whose main checkout is a real work tree. Ordinary checkouts, non-git
# directories, bare-repo worktrees, and old git without --path-format all fall
# through to PROJECT_DIR unchanged — identical to pre-fix behaviour. Only
# REMEMBER_DIR is affected; PROJECT_DIR stays the worktree path so session
# recovery still finds transcripts under the worktree slug.

    # not a linked worktree" with a shell builtin, and the ~200ms `git rev-parse`
    # below is not paid at all in the overwhelmingly common case (#230). That
    # matters because PostToolUse pays this on EVERY tool call.
    #
    # The POSITIVE answer only. The ABSENCE of `.git` proves nothing — a
    # subdirectory of a worktree has no `.git` entry and still needs the redirect
    # — so everything that is not a confirmed main checkout falls through to the
    # unchanged chain below. Written as an `if` rather than `[ … ] && { … }` so
    # the false branch cannot hand a non-zero status to a `set -e` caller.

# (#297).
#
# A FUNCTION THAT ASSIGNS, not one that echoes, and it must never be called as
# `$(...)`. This file is sourced by bootstrap-dirs.sh and by log.sh, and
# post-tool-hook.sh reaches both on the tool call that resolves — the first of a
# session and the first after any config edit (#350 made the rest of them replay
# instead). session-start-hook.sh and save-session.sh reach it unconditionally.
# A command substitution here is a fork on every one of those, which is the cost
# #230 went to trouble removing and #296 refused to add back. Everything below
# is parameter expansion: no subshell, no external command, no measurable cost
# on that path.
#
# This exists because of a circularity #296 left open. The slug record lives at
# <REMEMBER_DIR>/tmp/session-slug, and in the layout config.user.example.json
# ships — "data_dir": "~/.remember/{slug}", under a _purpose that says to copy
# it — REMEMBER_DIR is itself named by the slug, so a caller had to know the
# answer to open the file holding it. The store root is the one path in that
# layout a caller CAN name: it is the part of the template before the
# placeholder, so the template alone yields it.
#
# It is deliberately empty when there is no {slug}. In the legacy layout
# (<project>/.remember) and in a single-directory external store, REMEMBER_DIR
# and the store root are the same directory and the record is already reachable
# from project_dir and the template — so there is nothing to publish, and the
# session-start index that reads this stays off. The common layout does not pay
# for the external one.
#
# A prefix of "/" or a bare drive is refused rather than accepted. It would put
# a plugin-owned file at /tmp/sessions, which on a shared world-writable
# directory is a hijack waiting to happen, and no one keeps a memory store at
# the filesystem root.
