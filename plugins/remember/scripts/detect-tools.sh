# detect-tools.sh — Detect python and jq with cross-platform fallbacks
# ============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Finds the correct python and jq commands, handling platform differences:
#     - python3 vs python (Windows only has python by default)
#     - jq presence check with shell fallback for simple JSON reads
#     - CRLF-safe variable capture from Python output (Windows Git Bash)
#
# USAGE
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/detect-tools.sh"
#   # Now PYTHON and JQ are set (eager mode, the default)
#   $PYTHON -m pipeline.shell extract ...
#   val=$($JQ -r '.key' file.json)
#
#   _REMEMBER_LAZY_PYTHON=1 source "$(dirname "$0")/detect-tools.sh"
#   # Lazy mode (#662): JQ is set, PYTHON stays EMPTY until the first
#   # `_remember_python` call resolves it -- see "Lazy mode" below. Only
#   # session-start-hook.sh opts in; every other sourcer needs $PYTHON
#   # right away and keeps the eager default.
#
# ENVIRONMENT (outputs)
#   PYTHON       Path/command for python (python3 or python, validated).
#                Lazy mode: empty until `_remember_python` has run.
#   JQ           Path/command for jq (jq or _jq_fallback function)
#
# EXIT CODES
#   1   No usable python found (eager mode). In lazy mode sourcing never
#       exits for this; `_remember_python` returns 1 at the call site
#       instead, and the jq-less fallbacks fall through to python3.
#
# ============================================================================
# --- Tool verdict cache (#668) ---
# PYTHON/JQ detection is a subprocess probe (python3 -V, and up to 4
# candidates on a cold PATH; a jq presence check) paid on EVERY hook
# invocation that sources this file -- the post-tool hot path included. The
# verdict cannot change unless $PATH changes, so it is cached keyed on the
# exact PATH string: there is no "source file" whose mtime could track a
# PATH change the way the other #668 caches key on file mtimes, so identity
# is the whole PATH value itself, byte for byte (the issue's own guidance:
# "bash ${PATH} compared as a string is enough").
#
# Lives under the system temp dir (like lib-env-cache.sh's own cache file),
# NOT under REMEMBER_DIR: this file runs before bootstrap-dirs.sh, so
# REMEMBER_DIR is not known yet. It is machine/PATH-global rather than
# per-project, which is correct -- which python and whether jq is on PATH do
# not depend on which project a hook is running for.
#
# SECURITY: same convention as lib-env-cache.sh -- read only when it is a
# regular file (never a symlink) owned by the current user; a pre-planted
# file from another user on a shared tmp dir simply fails that check and
# falls through to a real (re-)detection, exactly as if no cache existed.
_REMEMBER_TOOLS_CACHE="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/remember-detect-tools-cache"

# Defined unconditionally (cheap -- a function definition, never invoked
# unless JQ actually points to it) so a cache hit reporting JQ=_jq_fallback
# has something to call: before this refactor the function only existed
# inside the "no jq on PATH" branch, which a cache hit would skip entirely.

# --- Detect Python ---
# Try python3 first (macOS/Linux default), fall back to python, then the
# Windows `py` launcher. On Windows, `python3` and `python` may resolve to
# the Microsoft Store placeholder (a stub that only opens the Store when
# Python is not installed via Store). A `command -v` check alone is not
# enough — validate with `-V` to confirm the binary actually runs.
#
# Each candidate's verdict is kept as it is probed (#650) -- `not on PATH`,
# or the exit status of its `-V` -- and printed ONLY on the fatal path. A
# Windows reporter logged 1,650 consecutive hook failures over a month,
# every one this FATAL, while `python -V` and `py -3 -V` worked in the shell
# the hooks launch from; a second plugin's independent probe failed
# identically in the same window, then both self-resolved with nothing
# changed. Nobody can say why, because the old message named the
# candidates and nothing about what was seen: not the PATH searched, not
# which names resolved, not what the resolved ones exited with. With those
# in hook-errors.log the next such report is answerable from the log alone.
# Nothing is printed on success: this file is sourced on the post-tool hot
# path, where stderr is hook-errors.log, on every tool call.
#
# --- Lazy mode (#662) ---
# Sourcing this file used to ALWAYS run the probe below, even though PYTHON
# is only read by four call sites (lib-memory-dir.sh's jq-less config merge,
# log.sh's jq-less per-key read, lib-slug.sh's two Python-hash fallbacks, and
# _jq_fallback itself below) -- none of which fire on the common jq-present
# foreground path. A caller that sets _REMEMBER_LAZY_PYTHON=1 BEFORE sourcing
# this file (session-start-hook.sh does; nothing else does, because every
# other sourcer -- post-tool-hook.sh, save-session.sh, run-consolidation.sh,
# doctor.sh -- genuinely invokes $PYTHON -m pipeline.shell unconditionally
# right after sourcing, so eager detection there is real work, not waste)
# gets the probe deferred into `_remember_python`, called at first actual
# need instead of here. Every other sourcer keeps today's exact behavior:
# `_remember_python` is defined as a no-op (PYTHON already set, below) so a
# call site that unconditionally calls it (to cover BOTH modes) costs
# nothing extra when lazy mode is off.
