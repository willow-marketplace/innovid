"""One status line for a repository this loop manages (#479).

Claude Code pipes a JSON payload in on stdin once per assistant message and prints
whatever this writes on stdout. That cadence is the whole design constraint: a render
that makes a network call makes one every message, so the forge counts come from a cache
that a detached ``--refresh`` run repopulates, and the render itself only reads files.

**Every field has three states and the third is never rounded up.** A count nobody took
prints `?`, never `0`. A version comparison nobody could make prints `?`, never a tick.
A transcript this process did not read to the bottom cannot say "no tick is armed" -- it
says `?`, because a window that did not reach the top of the file is not a file with
nothing in it. That is the defect class this repository is named after, and a status line
is where it is easiest to commit: the render always produces *something*, so a wrong
answer looks exactly like a right one.

Nothing here is hardcoded about any repository. The forge slug comes from the managed
repo's own ``.oss.json``; the plugin repositories come from each installed plugin's own
manifest, the same derivation ``scripts/doctor.py`` uses and for the same reason.

No third-party imports: this file is vendored into ``.oss/statusline.py`` in repositories
that install nothing to run it.

#: that count is a fact about the loop's plugins rather than about any managed repo and is

#: recently by #1079's own added call, is exactly the drift that made the number wrong
#: before it was noticed). They answer a question that changes on the order of weeks -- so
#: they are carried forward between long intervals rather than making the board wait on
#: them.
LATEST_REFRESH_AFTER = 3600

#: A third clock (#613), beside the two above, for the one field that answers a
#: question neither of them can afford: is the watch channel actually delivering.
#: `channel:health` is classed `acts` and spawns `claude mcp get` once per
#: subscription tag -- 1-3s measured in supertool's own presets/watch/channel.py
#: -- so it cannot share the board's 60s clock, and the consumer it asks about can
#: die at any moment, which is far too often for LATEST_REFRESH_AFTER's 3600s.
#:
#: 300 is a GUESS TO BE MEASURED, not a number this module asserts as correct --
#: the issue's own words (#613). There is no history of consumer deaths on this
#: repository to fit an interval to, so any starting value ships unmeasured; what
#: would settle it is a wall-clock record of how long a real death goes
#: unreported at this interval, taken the first time one actually happens. State
#: what it cost when that reading is in hand -- do not silently promote this
#: constant to "measured" later without adding that record.
CHANNEL_REFRESH_AFTER = 300

#: A fourth clock (#1314), for the one field slower than all three above it:
#: `/oss:doctor`'s own verdict. The issue that asked for this field measured
#: `channel:health` alone -- one check inside the diagnostic -- past 20 seconds in
#: its worst case, and the full diagnostic runs many more checks besides. That rules
#: out the board's 60s clock outright, and it is also nowhere near as volatile as
#: `CHANNEL_REFRESH_AFTER`'s own subject -- a dead consumer can appear between one
#: render and the next; a new doctor WARN generally does not. `LATEST_REFRESH_AFTER`'s
#: own docstring quotes "the order of weeks" for ITS subject (a published version) and
#: is itself set to one hour, not weeks -- read as a starting interval already judged
#: acceptable for a similarly slow-moving, comparatively expensive-to-check fact,
#: never as a claim that doctor's own findings change on a weekly cadence. Sharing
#: that number rather than inventing a fifth one unmeasured in either direction.
DOCTOR_REFRESH_AFTER = LATEST_REFRESH_AFTER

#: How long the detached refresh may wait on `doctor.py` before giving up on that one
#: reading and moving on. Comfortably above the >20s worst case named above, and

#: refresh lock in time for the next refresh to retry, rather than freezing every

    (#1362) the session that took it into the state `render` actually shows

    Five ways this becomes `cannot_determine` before a caller ever sees one of
    the five real states, and each is a distinct reason a reader might act on
    differently -- collapsing them into one `?` would be this module's own
    defect class, the same reason `board_from_cache` keeps its counts separate:

    * ``not-asked``    -- nobody has taken a reading yet (`fetched_at` is None).
    * ``other-session`` -- the reading is real and fresh, but it was taken by a
      DIFFERENT session on this same repository (#1362): `raw_state`'s
      `forwarding` vs `not_subscribed` distinction comes from whether *the
      session that took the reading* is subscribed to the socket, and two
      sessions on one repo -- one armed via `bin/oss-workspace`, one a bare
      `claude` -- can hold genuinely different, simultaneously correct
      answers. Checked right after `not-asked`, before attribution or
      staleness: a reading that is not this session's own cannot be trusted
      regardless of how sound it otherwise looks.
    * ``stale``        -- the reading is older than its own refresh interval
      (#550/#551's lesson, applied a third time: never let an old reading
      render as though it were fresh).
    * ``not-attributable`` -- the channel name this reading came from is
      neither what this repository's own `.oss.json` would derive NOR what
      this repository's own tracked `.supertool.json` declares, so the socket
      and poller slots may be another project's fleet entirely. Checked first
      and unconditionally: an unattributed reading must never reach the
      real-state branch below, however fresh it is.
    * ``declaration-unreadable`` -- neither route settled it, and the reason
      the declaration route could not is that `.supertool.json` is there and
      could not be read or parsed (#754). A file this module could not open
      is not evidence of "somebody else's fleet" -- it is evidence the
      question could not be asked, and folding the two together is precisely
      this repository's own defect class landing on the fix for it.

    `attribution` is one of ``"derivation"``, ``"declaration"``,
    ``"not-attributable"`` or ``"declaration-unreadable"`` -- `_channel_reading`
    decides which; this function only asks whether it is one of the first two
    (real attribution) or not.

    `session`/`current_session` are compared only when BOTH are truthy: a
    cache written before #1362 carries no `session` key at all, and a caller
    with no session identity of its own (`doctor.py`'s re-derivation, which
    has none to compare against) passes `current_session=None` -- neither
    should manufacture a mismatch that was never actually observed. That
    window self-heals at the next full refresh, the same convention #754's
    own migration comment above uses for the old `attributable` boolean.

    Deliberately NOT handled here, and this is #551's own gap restated for a
    third instrument: a reading that is fresh BY THIS RULE and simply wrong --
    the consumer died one second after the reading was taken -- renders exactly
    like a correct one. Nothing performs "the consumer died" the way
    `/oss:release` performs a publish, so there is no falsifying event to
    invalidate the cache against; #613's own docstring on `CHANNEL_REFRESH_AFTER`
    states that gap rather than papering over it.

    `not-asked` is checked BEFORE attribution, and that order is deliberate: a
    cache holding no reading at all also holds no attribution, so `attribution`
    defaults to a not-attributed value there too -- checking it first would
    report every never-asked repository as "not this repo's fleet" instead of
    "nobody has looked yet", which is a different and more alarming claim about
    a question that was never even put.

    cached, per the issue's own instruction. It still has to fail into a third state
    rather than `0`: a directory that could not be listed and a directory holding
    nothing waiting are the same defect this module is named after if they render
    alike (module docstring, lines 9-15).

    Same split `scripts/trap_curate.py`'s own `waiting()` already makes for this
    exact question, one script over, and for the same reason: a *missing*
    `trap.d/` (`FileNotFoundError`) means nobody has logged anything there yet --
    a real, measured `0` -- while any other `OSError` (a permission error,
    `trap.d/` replaced by a file) means this listing could not be taken at all,
    and folds to `None` so it renders `?` rather than a zero it never measured.
    Read separately rather than imported from `trap_curate` -- this module is
    vendored standalone into `.oss/statusline.py` in repositories that install
    nothing else to run it, and `trap_curate.py` is not part of what gets copied
    there.

    Counts `*.md` files not starting with `.`, matching `trap_curate.waiting`'s own
    filter -- `.gitkeep` (and any other dotfile) is excluded by the leading-dot
    check alone, with no separate name check needed -- **and excluding the one
    file `scaffold.py` owns inside that directory**, its README (#1348/#1372).

    That exclusion is a duplicated literal and it is duplicated knowingly, for
    the reason the paragraph above gives: this module is vendored standalone and
    cannot import `trap_curate`. So the parity this docstring claims is not
    enforced by construction, and #1372 is what happens when it is left to the
    claim alone -- #1348 excluded the README from `trap_curate.waiting` and not
    from here, and the two counters read 16 and 17 on this repository until a
    release audit reproduced it. What a maintainer saw: `trap 1` on a fully
    drained `trap.d/`, with no fragment left to delete that would clear it,
    while doctor's own trap-queue check said `none waiting` in the same run.
    `tests/test_gate3_round1_findings_1372.py` compares the two counters
    directly rather than trusting either docstring.

    epoch seconds, which are unambiguous by the time they arrive here -- and the second

    ``installed_plugins.json`` is one file shared by every project on this machine. One
    plugin has many entries -- one per scope and one per project that ever installed it
    -- and they carry different versions, because an old project's entry is never
    rewritten when a newer copy is installed elsewhere. The version this function used
    to report was the newest recorded *anywhere*, across every project -- which answers
    a question nobody asked: `max()` over the whole table can only ever report a version
    at or above the one actually resolved for this project, so a project pinned behind a
    sibling project's newer pin silently read as current (#521). Only entries that apply
    to ``project_root`` -- see `_entry_applies` -- are considered now; a project with no
    matching entry reports no version for that plugin, never the newest one lying
    around on the machine.

    the count would be a fact about a laptop rather than about the repository, and a
    second maintainer running this same loop would see a different number for the
    same tracker. `authorAssociation` is repo-relative and identical for everyone --
    and it is already what supertool's own `gh-issues` op uses for its external-filer
    marker, so the two boards agree instead of answering differently.

    **Not `gh issue list --json authorAssociation` (#620).** That field has never
    existed on `gh issue list` -- `gh` refuses the whole call, exit 1, empty stdout,
    every single time, and the six-fixture suite that shipped with #595 could not
    catch it because every fixture there mocked `_run`'s *return value* and none of
    them looked at what `_run` was *called with*. `author_association` does exist on
    the REST `repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` listing, so this reads that instead, with
    `--jq` selecting the one field this function needs and dropping pull requests --
    that endpoint mixes both, and a PR row carries a `pull_request` key an issue never
    has, so `select(.pull_request == null)` filters server-side before this function
    ever sees a row. Without it the row count would include PRs and permanently fail
    the cross-check below, because `_gh_count`'s own `is:issue` search never counts
    them.

    **`--jq` output, not `--paginate`'s raw concatenation, and the difference is not
    cosmetic.** `_gh_count`'s own docstring already documents that `gh api --paginate
    --jq` runs its filter once per page and prints one number per page with no total
    -- irrelevant here, since this asks for one row per issue rather than a count.
    What matters for `--paginate` *without* `--jq` is that each page is a raw JSON
    array, and concatenating two JSON arrays end to end produces text no parser can
    read (`[...][...]`) -- the exact trap #620's own writeup names for a naive fix.
    `--jq` sidesteps it by construction: piping `.[] | select(...) | .author_association`
    through jq's raw-output mode prints one bare `author_association` value per line,
    and *lines* concatenate safely across pages -- unlike JSON arrays, there is no
    boundary for two pages' lines to collide on. `--paginate` alone still walks every
    page regardless of the repository's issue count, so there is no analogue of the
    old `--limit`-at-100 hazard to reintroduce here.

    The row count is cross-checked against `total` exactly as before: fewer lines
    than the count `_gh_count` already took means this call did not cover every open
    issue (a rate limit, a truncated page, the tracker growing between the two
    calls), and the number is not reliable enough to report. `None`, never a count
    smaller than the truth -- the same convention `_gh_count`'s own docstring names.
    A `null` line (jq's raw-mode spelling of a missing/`None` field) is treated the

    (`refresh()`) passes `config.get("default_branch")`, never anything derived
    from the current checkout (#1312).** This function has no way to notice which
    branch or worktree the statusline process is actually running from, and
    nothing should ever change that: the marker `_default_branch_marker` renders
    from this function's return value must keep meaning "is the declared default
    green", identically whether this loop is standing in `main` or in one of its
    own worktrees on `fix/NNNN`.

    `gh-branch` (supertool) enumerates every workflow run on the head SHA and
    collapses re-runs and multi-run workflows to answer conjunctively -- machinery
    this render does not need, because it produces one glyph, not a table.

    **Two sources, not one (#914).** The combined-status endpoint alone answers
    `total_count == 0` on every commit of an Actions-only repository, because
    GitHub Actions writes check-runs, not legacy commit statuses -- so a repo
    whose CI is entirely Actions (this one) could never read anything but

    "not settled" even if the other source is quiet; `"no-run"` is reserved for
    the case both sources answered and both came back with `total == 0`. If one
    source did not answer at all (`None`) and the other came back empty, this is
    read as `None` rather than guessed as `"no-run"` -- the unanswered source
    could carry data this function never saw, and `None` is what every caller
    here already reads as "no answer", never as "confirmed idle" (mirrors the
    `total_count == 0` vs `state` distinction the combined-status reading always

    * ``"declaration"`` -- derivation did not match, and a repository whose

      .supertool.json and exported as SUPERTOOL_WATCH_NAME, and they match" --
      so this route asks the identical question: exactly one
      `ops.*.watch_name` declared (more than one is `not-attributable`, the
      same as doctor.py's own `conflict` state), and it equals what is
      actually exported.
    * ``"declaration-unreadable"`` -- derivation did not match, and
      `.supertool.json` exists and could not be read or parsed. Never folded
      into `not-attributable`: a file this module could not open is evidence
      the question could not be asked, not evidence of someone else's fleet.
    * ``"not-attributable"`` -- neither route matched (or nothing is
      declared, or nothing is exported). The socket and poller slots may be
      another project's fleet entirely, however real the reading itself is.

    Declaration is checked only when derivation did not already settle the

    is safe to execute unread, beyond merely existing (#1334).

    `_statusline_sibling_doctor_path` resolves a path beside `__file__` with no
    check on WHICH `__file__` is running it. In a managed repository the
    vendored copy of this module lives at `<repo>/.oss/statusline.py`
    (`scaffold.py`'s `OWNED_DIR`), so the sibling candidate resolves to
    `<repo>/.oss/doctor.py` -- a path INSIDE the repository under inspection,
    not gitignored, and addable by an ordinary pull request. `_doctor_reading`
    then runs whatever is there with `sys.executable`, in the maintainer's own
    session, reachable with no user action (`gather()` forks a refresh
    whenever the board is stale) and before any review of that pull request.

    This checks the one fact that is NOT attacker-controlled: the name of the
    directory the running module actually lives in. `scaffold.py` is the only
    writer of a vendored copy and always uses the literal ".oss" -- a pull
    request against the managed repo can add files inside that directory but
    cannot relocate which directory `.oss/statusline.py` itself executes from.
    So a sibling candidate whose parent directory is named `.oss` is refused
    outright, and `_doctor_script_path` falls through to the installed-plugin
    candidate instead, exactly as it already does when the sibling is simply
    missing. Everywhere else -- this repository's own `scripts/` checkout, a
    pytest fixture directory, the plugin's own installed `scripts/` directory
    -- is unaffected; this closes one specific, attacker-reachable path rather
    than adding a hash or signature scheme this loop has no way to bootstrap
    trust for.

    Compared case-folded (self-review finding): on a case-insensitive but
    case-preserving filesystem (default macOS APFS, default Windows NTFS),
    `<repo>/.OSS/statusline.py` is the SAME directory on disk as
    `<repo>/.oss/statusline.py` even though the two path strings differ, and
    `scaffold.py` never varies its own literal-lowercase spelling -- but
    nothing here controls what string the harness's own invocation path (a
    hook config, a symlink, a future resolver) happens to carry. A
    case-sensitive comparison would (wrongly) trust the vendored sibling the
    moment that string happened to spell the directory with any other
    casing, silently reopening the exact bypass this function exists to
    close. `.lower()` on both sides removes that dependency entirely rather
    than assuming today's one invocation path is the only one that will ever

    event, known at the moment it happens, rather than waited out on a clock that
    cannot see it (#550 covers the render side of the same incident; neither
    substitutes for the other).

    Three states, because a cache this could not reach and a cache with nothing to
    clear must not render alike:

    * ``invalidated`` -- a `latest` (or `latest_fetched_at`) entry existed and is
      now `{}` / a stamp one second past due, rather than absent. The next
      render or refresh starts from "nobody has asked yet" rather than from the
      value that was just falsified.
    * ``nothing-to-invalidate`` -- no cache file at this path, or one that carries
      no `latest` reading at all. There was nothing to falsify.
    * ``could-not-invalidate`` -- the file exists and could not be read, could not
      be parsed, is not a JSON object, or could not be written back. An absent
      directory, an unreadable file, or a different `XDG_CACHE_HOME` than the
      rendering session uses all land here rather than passing as either state
      above.

    **`latest`/`latest_fetched_at` are set to `{}`/well in the past, never
    deleted** -- this was a bare `pop()` of both keys and it was wrong (self-review
    finding on this same issue): `latest_is_due` reads a document with no
    `latest_fetched_at` at all as a legacy, pre-#515 cache and falls back to
    comparing `now` against `fetched_at` -- the BOARD's own stamp, refreshed on
    nearly every render. A document with both keys simply gone therefore reads as
    "recently fetched" the instant the next board refresh runs, and `refresh()`
    carries the (empty) `latest` forward under that fresh-looking stamp instead of
    re-asking, in an active session effectively forever.

    `latest_fetched_at` is stamped `now - LATEST_REFRESH_AFTER - 1` -- one second
    past due, relative to the moment of invalidation, rather than a fixed absolute
    sentinel like `0`. Anchoring to an absolute epoch would only be reliably "due"
    against a real wall clock (`now` several billion seconds past `0`), and this
    module's own test suite drives `now` with small synthetic values throughout
    (e.g. `1_000.0`); an absolute sentinel would be correct in production and
    silently wrong under exactly the convention this repository tests with. The
    relative stamp is due under `latest_is_due` regardless of what `now` means.

    ``now`` defaults to `time.time()`, matching `refresh()`'s own parameter, so a
    test can drive it without a real clock.

    Read-modify-write on the same file `refresh()` writes, with the same
    write-to-temp-then-`os.replace` -- a concurrent renderer's own read either sees
    the old document or the new one, never a half-written one. This never touches
    the `prs`/`issues`/`pr_checks` board half of the document; only the two

    # ordinary (non-legacy) branch and compares against a stamp that is due by
    # construction, regardless of what the board's own `fetched_at` says. A fixed
    # absolute sentinel (`0`) was tried and rejected: it is due against a real
